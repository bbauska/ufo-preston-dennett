UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE THREE
Aug 23, 2024

Summary:
Aug 23, 2024
Has every location on our planet been visited by UFOs? The answer appears to be a resounding: yes! I put out a challenge to anyone interested in this subject: name a town or city anywhere on this planet, and I will find a UFO case there. Hundreds of people have responded, and so far, every place I have investigated has a history of UFOs and extraterrestrials. In Part Three of this series, “UFOs in Your Hometown,” we continue the search for UFOs across planet Earth, covering nine different locations, including Ealing, London (UK,); Frankfort, IN; Warrenton, MO; Santa Clarita, CA; Milwaukee, WI; Roseville, CA; Show Low, AZ; Littleton, MA and Bastrop, TX. These cases include the full range of UFO activity: sighting, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters, even a possible UFO crash.

EALING, LONDON, UK. Way back in 1845, numerous people reported seeing a humanoid wearing skintight overalls and a transparent helmet leaping over walls far faster than a human. There’s also the 1978 sighting of a classic flying saucer that the witness felt was meant for him to see. Or the gentleman who saw a boomerang-shaped craft during a lunar eclipse in 2015. And more!

FRANKFORT, INDIANA. Starting in 1953, Frankfort has been the location of constant UFO activity. Sightings continued throughout the 1950s, culminating in a fantastic encounter in 1958 when four UFOs played hide-and-seek with a diesel train for over an hour. In 1977, four people reported a scary encounter where they were followed by a UFO. In 1981, numerous people throughout Frankfort, including police, had amazing encounters, showing once again that UFOs are very interested in Frankfort.

WARRENTON, MISSOURI. An incredible 1969 encounter by a technical illustrator in Warrenton, MO is only one of several amazing cases. Another case involved a couple who had a very close encounter with a craft that hovered right above a highway overpass. In 2019, a couple were shocked to see a UFO cloaked inside a cloud come right over their home. They may have also seen humanoids!

SANTA CLARITA, CALIFORNIA. This town outside of Los Angeles, CA has some very dramatic cases. On July 13, 1979, Ed and Gloria Towers were shocked to see a metallic saucer target their home, hovering only 50 feet overhead. A very similar case happened to another Santa Clarita family in 2015 when a giant boomerang-shaped craft went right over their house. And more!

MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN. Sightings in this city reach back to 1896 with the famous airship wave. Throughout 1952, numerous city officials reported very dramatic sightings of solid craft darting around in the sky in some cases for hours at a time. More dramatic sightings occurred throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1980, an attorney reports that he was taken onboard a craft and met human-looking ETs. Sightings continued up to the present day, including a case of a UFO photograph in 2022.

ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA. Several amazing multiple-witness sightings of disc-shaped craft have occurred in this town. There’s also the case of a lady who was taken onboard a craft in 2004. In 2016, a highway patrol officer reported a dramatic encounter with a low-flying triangle. In 2022, a woman was puzzled by two objects hovering outside her home and managed to take two photos!

SHOW LOW, ARIZONA. In the summer of 1988, a woman woke up in her hotel room to see two unusual-looking ETs come through the wall, stand at the foot of her bed, and communicate telepathically with her. Just north of Show Low in the small town of Concho, a woman and her friends saw a UFO drop from the sky. They drove to the location, and came upon what appeared to be the craft stuck in a ravine.

LITTLETON, MASSACHUSETTS. Amazing sightings occurred here, including a 1954 low-level sighting of a Saturn-shaped object, a multi-witness sighting of a classic saucer in 1964, a sighting by two men of an object over a highway involving the strange “Oz Factor,” and a 2015 sighting directly over the local police station.

BASTROP/BERGSTROM AFB, TEXAS. In 1947 two Air Force officers at Bergstrom saw a silver saucer flying at 1,400 mph, overtaking their plane. In 1965, two Bergstrom officer with Top Secret clearances saw a craft with portholes right over the base. They told nobody. In 1980, a newsman and his wife had a dramatic sighting right outside Bastrop. In 1988, a UFO came so close to a Bastrop man that he shot at it with his gun. More dramatic cases continued in 2013 and 2014.

These are just some of the many amazing encounters that have occurred in these nine locations. Firsthand cases reaching back a hundred years up to the present day, multiple witnesses, a wide variety of evidence to support them: the truth can no longer be denied. The cases speak for themselves. We are not alone. Our planet is being visited; apparently every location on our planet! Including your own hometown!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is actually a part three of this ongoing series I call UFOs in your
hometown I put out a challenge some time ago give me a location and I can find
encounters there and guess what I'm batting 100% it does appear to be true that UFOs
are seen pretty much everywhere on our Planet so what I've picked are eight
locations today I'm choosing these in order of locations received by you guys
the viewers and the cases I found do cover pretty much the entire range so we
have Close Encounters of the first second and third kind face-to-face encounters with humanoids onboard
encounters the whole deal all kinds of evidence to support these encounters
cases leading back more than 100 years all the way up to the present day so I
hope you find this interesting I sure learned a lot and the locations I will be covering today include eing in London
UK also Frankfurt Indiana Warrington
Missouri Santa Clarita California Milwaukee Wisconsin Roseville California
Littleton Massachusetts and also bastrup in Texas and along with that right next
to B ASP is Bergstrom field Bergstrom Air Base so some really interesting
cases some I think you probably may have heard of but most I would be surprised
if you had and wow some that definitely deserve to be well known because they
are amazing and let's just get started with our first location which is eing in
London UK this is by special request of theodoris didn't find a whole lot this
is a relatively small section of London but I found some cases and I hope you
find it interesting Theodor because this is for you first case I found from eing
comes from researcher George mravik in his book strange and mysterious
phenomena of Great Britain Ireland and Europe and it does involve a humanoid
this incident occurred way back in 1845 according to numerous Witnesses a
humanoid with blazing eyes wearing a tight fitting overall a cloak and an
apparent transparent Globe over his head was seen leaping tall hedges and walls
that were way too high for a normal human to jump over now George mravik interpreted this
humanoid as possibly being a very fit athletic madman wearing a bizarre
costume which to me seems a bit of a stretch but you can certainly make up your own mind about it it's an
interesting case not a lot of details to it but the fact is this description of
this humanoid is very much congruent with current modernday
cases a much more recent case from 1978 was reported to the ministry of
Defense by a gentleman who said he saw a quote gigantic saucer and quote which
was all lit up with colored lights and he said it seemed to him as if quote I
was meant to see this object this is something that a lot of people who see UFOs have said so that's certainly
interesting now this was shortly after the movie Close Encounters of the Third
Kind was released not sure that's a significant factor other than perhaps it
prompted him or encouraged him to report his own encounter a much more recent encounter
occurred on September 27 2015 and was reported to the National
UFO Reporting Center the day after it happened so clearly this impressed the
witness who is anonymous but September 27 was a lunar
eclipse and this gentleman from eing was viewing it when he saw a green
boomerang-shaped object he said it zoomed around five or six times before finally darting away he
noticed something else a strange aura or haze around the object and he also said
that while he was viewing this craft his cat seemed to react to its Presence by
jumping up onto his lap a second and very recent case from new Fork occurred
on May 18 2022 this involves a gentleman from eing who says he heard a loud crash coming
from outside his home and he went outside he didn't see anything but checking his security camera he saw what
appeared to be a streak of light coming down from the sky into his backyard yard he said it looked like it bounced twice
and then streak back upwards and he said it looked very much like a shooting star
except probably can't be a shooting star given that it bounced around and moved
upwards but since he didn't see it with his own eyes hard to say what that was
so there you go theodoris not a whole lot of cases but there was one involving humanoids and that's certainly an
interesting case but just goes to show again UFOs and ETS are seen everywhere
and we now move to our next location this is by special request of Steve Casper who asked me to look into the
area of Frankfurt Indiana and I found some amazing cases no cases really of
humanoids but while one case I found is really interesting and you could call
this just a sighting but man oh man it's such an amazing case it deserves to be really well known most of the early
cases I found in Frankfurt are quite brief here's one which occurred in 1953
exact date unknown but apparently a group of people saw two disc-shaped
objects hovering overhead they appeared to be white in color until the sun Shone
directly on them and they tilted in the air at which point these discs appeared to be silvery that's the first case but
certainly not the last it was 3 years later 9:30 p.m. on October 4
1956 when two men George Seiler and Dave King were out hunting in the woods about
6 miles Northwest of Frankfurt and they said that they both saw this weird
boat-shaped object kind of float lazily into view just over the Treetops and as
it moved off into the distance it faded away but it was immediately followed by
get this five other identical looking objects all traveling west to east
towards Frankfurt and like the first object these other five were silent
luminous and faded away as they moved off into the distance a pretty simple
and standard UFO sighting and here's another one July of
1956 Clarence greo said he saw a quote very bright object which looked like a
ball of silver a silvery sphere and moved very slowly but was quite high in
the sky he said there was some speculation that this might have been a satellite but it was just 3 months later
further events occurred which provided another possible answer to what's going on in Frankfurt and this is probably the
most amazing case that I found in the Frankfurt area this occurred to the crew
of a diesel Freight Train diesel freight train number 91 it has a regular route
between monan Indiana and Indianapolis and on October 3rd 1958
they were traveling south from monan towards Indianapolis with a train of 56
cars now this crew included at least five men we know who they are engineer
Harry emman fireman Cecil Bridge head Breakman Morris at conductor Edward
Robinson and the flagman Paul soby it was 3:20 a.m. again on October 3rd
1958 and it was near aasco that something very strange happened firemen
Cecil Bridge saw them first a group of four star-like lights moving in a sort
of rough v formation and he watched them for about 15 seconds and realizing that
they were quite strange immediately started started to alert the rest of the crew and as they all watched these
lights veered to the west and crossed the tracks ahead of them about a half
mile ahead as Cecil Bridge says in his own words they were moving pretty slowly
too at not more than about 50 m an hour four big white soft lights after the
lights crossed the tracks in front of us they stopped and came back now there was
some speculation that they actually landed on the TR tracks they're really not sure about this but the objects
darted off and a few minutes later came back again conductor Edward Robinson was
sitting in the Caboose of the train and he got a real close look at them as he says in his own words all of a sudden
they came back this time they came down over the train a little way in back of
the engine they were coming towards the Caboose that is they were going north
and the train was heading directly South I'd say they were only a couple of hundred feet above the train as they
came towards the Caboose now fireman Cecil Bridge of course witnessed this and as he says
they flew over us one after another big round white things that looked about the
color of fluorescent lights kind of fuzzy around the edges they didn't glare
and they didn't light up things as they went over they just came back towards us over the top of the cars one after to
the other then they went on down the tracks maybe another half a mile and seemed to
stop now after stopping these objects darted very fast to the east at which
point they changed from bright white to yellow and then to a darkish orange and as Edward Robinson says they
must have circled the train and gone north of us real low because the next time we saw them they came rushing up
the tracks right in back of us they were coming a lot faster this time a lot
faster than they had come back over the train the first time they were just above the Treetops along the right of
way they were flying on edge we could see that they were round things circular
shaped on the bottom they were about 40 ft in diameter and maybe 10 ft thick so
these objects are pacing this train for quite some time and they continued to do so as this train went right through grew
Frankfurt towards Kirkland and turns out that there were several flashlights in the
Caboose so two of the crewman Edward Robinson and Cecil Bridge decided to get
those flashlights and Flash them at the UFOs and this is when things became even
more interesting at Cecil Bridge says we blinked our flashlight at the things and
we waved the lights we thought we might get them to come in closer they did come
down over the train a few minutes later as Edward Robinson describes this when
the things came down and flew right up the tracks behind the Caboose I grabbed that sealed beam flashlight and shined
it on them as soon as the light hit them they jumped sideways out of the beam
when they got back over the tracks I did it again and they scattered they acted like they didn't care for that light at
all from the time brid first called us on the radio until the last time we saw them near Kirkland it was about an hour
and 10 minutes they hung around the back end of the train but after we shined the
light on them they didn't come in close anymore while we were switching at
Frankfort they stayed away back up the tracks just hovered there until we moved
on then they followed us again when they finally went away at Kirkland they just
zipped off to the Northeast and kept on going and we didn't see them anymore so yeah these UFOs followed that
train for over an hour after they were gone after all of this occurred the crew discussed the
sighting and afraid of ridicule and disbelief decided not to report the
experience to the Air Force who they knew were basically ridiculing and trying to cover this subject up but they
did contact naikap the National investigative committee for aerial phenomenon and got in touch with Frank
Edwards researcher and radio host who interviewed each of them
firsthand but as Edward Robinson says it was the most fantastic thing I ever saw
if somebody else reported it I would think they were crazy now there's still a lot of activity over Frankfurt because
it was just two months later that Miss Irene Thomas saw something very similar
she was at her home on 457 Jefferson Street at 5:30 p.m. on December 4
1958 when she saw what she described as an orange colored object moving to the
West she called the local newspapers and a reporter was intrigued enough to drive
down to the West edge of the city and get this he saw not one but two objects
which he says were flying very quickly and as he watched the leading object
stopped climbed straight up reversed direction and darted off to the
Northwest the object behind it stopped in midair turned from Orange to White
and disappeared sounds very much like what the crew of the diesel train saw
and sightings continued it was on July 27 1966 that a Frankfurt resident said
that he saw a mysterious light approach as close as 500 ft away from him he said
it was totally silent that's all the information I have on that case but there's case after case in Frankfurt
Frankfurt really delivered on August 23rd 1977 four Witnesses including Emily Kars
Jim Waters and Mr and Miss Al Becker they were driving about 8 miles north of
Frankfurt when they said an object zoomed towards their car and then began to follow about 500 ft behind it they
stopped the car at which point the object veered off to the north but they said it was close enough that
they could hear a humming sound coming from it 4 years later July 6 1981 numerous
people called The Frankfurt police to report an object which hovered for no less than five hours from about 10 p.m.
until almost 3:00 a.m. many of the Witnesses were actually deputies
themselves they watched this object police dispatcher Ron Gunther said and I
quote it moved around in circles and then back and forth and when it was done playing
games it just went straight up in the air and out of sight one of the witnesses Randy Arnold watched it from
his home 852 Myrtle Avenue watch it for hours he said this object appeared to be
spinning and flashing lights as he says it's pretty crazy it sounds pretty crazy
too you get to wondering if somebody is pulling a joke now there was some
speculation that this could have been a balloon but this was quickly ruled out none of the witnesses really thought
this but people were trying to explain it away and the fact is a this object
remained in place for far too long for it to be a balloon its movement was defying the wind currents its
description did not match a balloon and besides one month later on August 19
1981 it was back more calls came to the Sheriff's Office with one witness
describing it as this object being covered with red white and sort of blue
green flashing lights all over it he said it looked like quote a building
standing upright one witness Wesley Thomas said he saw this object hovering directly
over the 600 block of Kyer Street sheriff's deputy Tom Katan
watched this object for three hours as it moved slowly overhead he was one of about eight other
police officers watching this object in fact police chief Paul Underwood said
they saw something but they don't know what it was and nobody else seems to
know and that's pretty much it for Frankfurt though I will say it was just
two days later that the town of Hamilton in the northeast corner of the state had a huge wave of sightings and in fact
police received at least 93 calls in the space of 2 hours can you imagine talk
about the phones ringing off the hook this got a huge amount of press coverage and I'm sure there are plenty of other
Frankfurt cases out there but those were certainly the most interesting there you
go Steve I have to say Frankfurt Indiana really did deliver some truly
astonishing cases I especially found that one involving the train
super interesting seems to me this is another example of UFOs putting on a display wanting people to see them
announcing their presence that's certainly what it looks like but in amazing case whatever the motive was and
now we move to our next location which again was requested by Steve Casper so
it's two for the price of one Steve and you asked me to look into Warrington
Missouri and I found some cases not whole lot but enough to prove my theory
that yes UFOs are seen everywhere on this planet so hope you find these three
cases interesting I'm sure there's more out there but these three are enough to
prove that UFOs are visiting every location on our planet the first of
three cases I found in warron one occurred in November of
1969 main witness is Leonard riffkin he's a technical illustrator for McDonald
aircraft I did confirm his employment and he was out deer hunting in a field
just off Highway 70 near Warrington it was 5:30 a.m. when he says he saw this
strange glowing object appear on the western Horizon and he started watching
it and as it moved overhead it suddenly made a sharp 90° turn towards the north
that's not something a plane or helicopter or a balloon can do and as if to sort of put the nail in the coffin it
made three more sharp angle turns and then disappeared to the south over the woods also this object was totally
silent the whole time there were two cases reported to the National UFO Reporting Center more than that but
these are the most interesting ones was around midnight on December 12th 1996 when a married couple was driving
along the I70 very near Warren to when they noticed a bright light ahead
of them it was about 1,000 ft up over an overpass so very low and as they drove
under it they could see what looked like four little triangular formations on the
bottom as they drove on this object moved off but shortly later they saw this weird Red Orb bouncing up and down
and this was one of many sightings by the witness over a number of years but
he says this was one of his most interesting a second and more recent
sighting occurred on the evening of October 5 2019 the witness stepped outside her
home in Warrington to look at the stars and saw this weird huge kind of Misty
cloud-like object which was moving pretty fast for a cloud at about 30 mph
and it was just above the tree line and heading towards her house as she says I
looked looked closer and noticed it was a solid object emitting smoke all over
it as if it were trying to be a cloud it was totally silent seeing how weird it
was she immediately called out to her husband what is that and he came to look
and they both watched this thing as it made a hard left turn moving towards the east she became frightened at this point
and ran inside but her husband stayed outside and watched this thing move behind their house at which point it was
close enough that he could make out a dark sort of charcoal gray chevron shaped object hidden inside this Misty
cloud and as the witness says we both lost sleep over this that night and
spent hours researching what we saw so that's warron Missouri and definitely as
you can see ETS are aware of it they're showing themselves everywhere mostly just sightings but
don't worry I do have some some humanoid cases coming up some onboard cases photographic cases really amazing stuff
in this episode and the next location I'd like to cover is Santa Clarita
California I actually got a couple of requests for this location from Steve
Chris and Christina and yeah Santa Clarita delivered with an especially astonishing
case very close-up Encounter of a UFO hovering over someone's home just a
couple of cases but I will say I did cover an earlier case in Santa Clarita
in my episode if you call them they will come I check that one out it's a truly
amazing case involving an onboard experience a very closeup very extensive
encounter involving a lady by the name of Geneva Sterling who basically called
out for help to the universe and a UFO showed up so yeah check that out but
definitely found some other cases and one woo amazing all the cases in this
episode I have to tell you this one to me is one of the most interesting W it's
just a fascinating case did appear in Albert rosal's book Michael shrat
investigated this as well this was reported to by the witness to numerous
UFO organizations uh the Witnesses are Ed towers and his wife
Gloria Ed Towers is a great witness he's an aeronautical engineer he served as an
executive for major aircraft companies so he knows aircraft it was 900 p.m. on
July 13 1979 when they had this amazing
encounter Ed was in the backyard of his Santa clear to home and was cleaning the
pool suddenly he noticed this strange craft approach ing from about two maybe
one block away and it was flying very low and he could see immediately that
this was not normal it had strange lights all around the circumference and
as Ed says it was immediately obvious to me that the craft was not a helicopter
nor airplane now he called out to his wife Gloria and their kids the kids did not
come out but his wife Gloria did just in time to see this thing approach come
right over their house as Ed says in his own words by that time the craft was
right over our pool area at an altitude of no more than 50 to 75 ft and perhaps
even less the craft had come to a stop in proximity to our pool area as we
stood below it the craft made no sound whatsoever it wobbled slightly as if it
were moved by the wind but there was no noticeable wind at that moment the craft
leaned forward and downwards and then we saw a large forward angled window we
could see an orange bluish glow from inside but no occupants or controls the
craft seemed to be manufactured as one solid piece there were no visible seams
or rivets now I did notice that the bottom was concave it had two weird rectangular
protrusions of some kind it did have an upper Dome with what looked like Port holes but no markings no Insignia was
quite large about 50 to 75 ft wide about the size of a large
house and Gloria the wife was awed by the sight and she kept saying over and
over again oh my God now Ed at this point spoke telepathically mentally out
to them and said quote take me with you
they apparently did not cuz this was just a sighting uh now as Ed says we were both
Frozen in awe and disbelief it was like seeing a large bus floating over your
house he said that they had no fear but were absolutely a struck they didn't
speak or look at each other during the whole time they just stared at this craft both had the sensation of being
watched especially because the way the crowd was tilted forward as if to look at them
and this standoff went on for about 45 seconds at which point the craft moved
off at about 20 miles per hour and as Ed says my conclusion is that the craft
wanted us to observe it or perhaps it was examining us I am 100% sure this was
not a man-made craft or technology they did report their
sighting to the police who said that they had not received any other calls
now here's an interesting part of this case according to Albert rosal's as the
craft moved off they did see two humanoid forms dressed in black up to
the neck but they could not make out any facial details now this report of humanoids
does not appear in their original report so I'm not sure Ros Ali says he got this
information directly from them and you know perhaps there was some amnesia
elements going on here this sort of thing has turned up in other cases where people don't initially report or
remember seeing humanoids so either way it's a truly incredible
sighting and I looked for other cases and new Fork does have a few dozen
reports these are almost exclusively anomalous lights either hovering or
darting around or quite distant but one impressive report of a solid craft
occurred Ur on June 13 2005 by synchronicity was again while
people were standing next to their pool four adults and three children were out swimming in the neighbor pool when they
saw this very large Boomerang shaped object they said it had seven to eight
small blinking red lights along the edge it made a soft engine noise and as it
moved off a fighter jet appeared flying behind it and it looked almost to the
witnesses as if it was escorting it and that made them wonder if this might in fact be an advanced military craft of
some kind it's important to note that Edwards Air Force Base is located only
about 50 miles to the North Edwards of course is an air base where all kinds of
quote reverse engineering is going on so that could be what's going on here not
everything in the sky is necessarily ET so there you go Steve Chris and
Christina There Are UFOs over Santa Clarita and boy that case involving the
gentleman by the name of Ed towers and his wife can only imagine what it must
have been like to see a UFO that close hovering right over their house amazing
a really well documented case and I think it says a lot about why ich are
here I think it's one of their main goals really is to Simply announce their presence and they sure are doing this in
a way that's absolutely undeniable and now we move to our next
location which was by special request of Kim and that is Milwaukee Wisconsin of
all the locations Milwaukee definitely delivered a huge variety of cases not
only sightings but humanoids and onboard case really interesting photographic
case as well and case is going all the way back to to the 1800s to pretty much
the current day so I think you will find this very interesting and again I sure
learned some new things just doing the research in these various locations as
it turns out Milwaukee is part of the amazing Airship wave of
1896 one of the first sightings occurred on April 12th as the janitor at the
Central police station in Milwaukee says that he saw a strange quote machine
hovering only 1,000 ft above Milwaukee city hall said it was oval in shape but
the big sighting occurred on December 6th 1896 one of the witnesses was millionaire Herbert nunamaker and he was
at the Fister hotel in Milwaukee when he saw an object floating over the Bay against the wind he grabbed his field
glasses and saw what appeared to be a male figure inside it this point he ran
outside to get a better look but it was gone going back inside 10 minutes later
he saw it again apparently there were quite a few witnesses to this hundreds
in Milwaukee this was part of the mysterious Airship wave of the late 1890s which has yet to be explained the
sightings continued in April 1952 Witnesses observed a group of five
disc-shaped objects move over the city unfortunately no other details but 1952
was a big year because on July 27 1952
three Milwaukee civil Patrol employees good Witnesses saw a silvery sphere up
in the sky at about 2,000 FT elevation not very high one of the witnesses
Clayton Feldman said and I quote I realized it was metal because it glinted
in the sun they were driving and they said it moved along with them as they drove about 10 Mi west of
Milwaukee and it was just 1 month later when policemen and firemen watched an
object hovering in the sky for over 90 minutes this was the night of August 31
1952 one of the witnesses was fire captain Bernard goek and he said this
object quote wavered in one location but not steady with varied colored lights
that kept going on and off police Sergeant Rudy Messer and
other policemen and firemen watched this object and said it was disc shaped and that it had red green blue yellow and
white lights all lit up like a Christmas tree now a weather balloon had been released the previous night but it was
ruled out as the cause of this sighting because this weather balloon had been seen moving out over Lake Michigan and
disappeared long before this UFO was seen and reportedly many other Witnesses
called the police to report sightings on that same night here's another really interesting close-up sighting of a solid
disc which was reported by Donald E Heffernan to the center of UFO studies
he says that in the spring of 1962 he stepped outside of his Milwaukee home
and was confronted by a very closeup disc-shaped object he says that quote
this object approached from my left side within 10 ft I can only describe it as a
round webike transparent object its lines were intricate beyond belief I
looked at it and it came closer I never took my eyes off of it it began to move
towards the area in front of me it moved very slowly until it was out of sight
some time after this incident I was looking at a UFO Magazine and there was a picture of a group of men at a UFO
meeting Behind these men there was a bulletin board with pictures pictures and one picture was a crude attempt to
draw the same object I saw that night in Milwaukee this is no disrespect to the
artist but I believe it would be impossible to copy its delicate lines
another sighting occurred at 1:45 a.m. on August 3rd 1962 the Witnesses were herb thrun and
his wife and they observed a brilliant light zoom over their house from south to North they live about 10 m south of
Mitchell Air Force Base they said this object appeared to be revolving and as it came overhead they could see more
detail it looked almost cigar shaped golden orange in color totally silent
and as soon as it was right over their heads they saw a quote huge sunflower
shaped light this began to Blink on and off and then the object moved in sort of
a flat course towards the Miller Brewing Company maybe they went to check out
that I don't know now here's a case involving humanoids it's quite brief but it
occurred at 4:30 a.m. on August 1st 1976 the witness identified only by her
initials lvk she's 20 years old heard this strange noise outside her home
looked out the window and says that she saw two humanoid figures they were of
normal height she was unable to see the details of their FA es but it was strange because as soon as she looked at
them she saw a beam of light come out from them towards the east and she also
heard them talking in a weird unintelligible foreign language
unfortunately there are no other details to this case 3 years later on August 5th
1979 a guy was driving 20 mil north of Milwaukee when he said he saw five large
red lights in a V formation they quickly moved downward and to the right ahead of
them Vanishing as they moved towards the horizon he says they did move slowly but
they were obvious enough that he was surprised to see that the other traffic on the highway did not appear to react
or even see them at all a simple sighting but definitely interesting and here's another one that
same year fact less than one month later 8:30 p.m. September 2nd 1979
Bruce sua and Randall Frost shoer were driving
eastbound on Drexel Boulevard this is off of Pennsylvania Avenue when they said they saw this weird glowing
dome-shaped object hovering over some trees now Bruce said it was quote very
bright orange in color glowing with different shades of orange he said this would sort of glow
and fade and as they got closer to it the object seemed to actually get smaller and it finally just
disappeared they did report it to the police who told them that they had in fact received at least three other
recent reports of objects in the area now here is an onboard encounter in
Milwaukee which comes from respected researcher Wendell Stevens was February 1980 when an
anonymous attorney woke up in the middle of the night to see a bright light Illuminating the interior of his house
he went out onto the patio to investigate and was shocked to see a disc-shaped object hovering only about
50 ft up in the air and he's looking at this thing and the next thing he knows
he's inside of it he said it was greeted by a human looking people who he says
told him that they had come from the plees they took him to a screen which
showed the interior of his house he asked him about time travel and
something very strange happened they showed him an image of his property long before his house had even been built
this freaked him out a little bit but they proceeded to show him more images of the surrounding area where he lived
long before his house was built next thing he knows he's back on his patio watching this craft depart he turned to
go back inside his house and this is when he realized he was locked out he had left the doors open so he had to get
back inside and the next morning morning his daughter phoned to say that she had stopped by their house that night found
the patio doors wide open and had closed them certainly an interesting
case and here's another also that year 1980 was at 4:45 p.m. on August 3rd that
six-year-old Tiffany gardish was outside of her home located at 1711 Monroe
Avenue and she came running inside to tell her mother Shirley that she had just seen a UFO now her mother Shirley
thought that her child must be imagining things but Tiffany was excited so Shirley had Tiffany draw what she had
seen and looking at these pictures they showed a detailed solid object which
really impressed Shirley so she called the police the police showed little interest so she called the local airport
General Mitchell Field who had no comment so then she called the south Milwaukee voice Journal who printed a
small article about the case and here's another one more recent very brief but certainly impressive it's about a report
of an anomalous light this occurred at 3:45 p.m. on June 14
1997 when a gentleman known only as William H and his friend Julie were
sitting on the porch of a friend's home in Milwaukee Julie suddenly called out
oh my God look at that and as William says at that point we both sprang from
our chairs and stared at an erratic bright yellow orange light doing crazy
Spirals and then it slowed down a little and dropped out of the sky what I want to know is if anybody else witnessed
what we saw I suspect somebody did but they just didn't report it because it's very rare
that a person reports their sighting here's another real recent case
which comes from muon this occurred at 1:54 p.m. July 23rd
2022 a witness was at the Milwaukee air and water show and he was using his
iPhone to film a jet refueling operation now he didn't see anything at the time
he took this photo which you can see here but upon reviewing it he did see something strange in it a snapshot of
this video shows what appears to be a solid saucer-shaped object which must moved much faster than
a jet this was actually a video taken this is just a snapshot of the video but
the investigator who looked into this case came away with declaring this an
unidentified object there you go Kim thank you for requesting Milwaukee
certainly interesting I have to say I do love those humanoid cases those onboard cases the most but as we can see even
these sightings are sometimes super interesting and it shows that a lot is
going on here that we don't fully un understand I suspect quite a few of these sightings are someone else's
onboard experience that they're coming down and picking somebody up I can't prove it but I've seen this pattern in
other cases so that could be what's going on here in a bunch of these what we would call Close Encounters of the
first kind simple sightings but every single case adds to our knowledge of
what's going on here each case is important and even a simple sighting can absolutely change a person's world view
and we're certainly seeing that in these cases Here and Now we move to the next
location which is by special request of K Kay suggested I take a look into
Roseville California and I did and no surprise I found some really interesting
cases some sightings and onboard encounter really interesting
photographic case so yeah thank you K found out some really interesting stuff
about Roseville one of the first cases I found in Roseville occurred on July 15
1970 when a witness reported his sighting of a disc-shaped craft to new
Fork he said it was big 150 ft wide 50 ft thick had a band of Lights rotating
around the perimeter and he saw it hovering just at Treetop level very near
the Roseville High School only about 200 ft away away from him in fact he and his
friends watched it for about 2 minutes until it zoomed up and away and
disappeared Among the Stars one of them decided to call the police who said that they had in fact received other reports
of UFOs from the surrounding areas next report is 5 years later March 1st 1975
when a 15-year-old witness and her 18-year-old boyfriend and two others were driving near Roseville and all four
of them saw flying disc this set a dome on top Port holes in the dome your
classic Flying Saucer it hovered for 1 minute it was about 1/3 a mile ahead of
them less than 50 ft up so they got a pretty good look at it even though this was a very brief sighting next case
occurred at 12:15 p.m. August 26 2001 when a man and wife were driving West on
Pleasant Grove Boulevard approach approaching Washington Boulevard when
they saw six oval-shaped objects totally silent making fantastic Maneuvers which
absolutely ruled out any normal conventional aircraft these objects were
darting circling hovering and here's where it gets super interesting because these objects were really hard to see as
they almost perfectly matched the background of the sky but when the wife put her sunglasses on she said that they
were quote very discernible this kind of reminds me of the movie They Live by
John Carpenter I don't know if you've seen it or not but you can only see the aliens if you put on the
sunglasses so that's interesting there perhaps these objects in some way were
emitting some field of energy that was much more visible through the
sunglasses now here's a report of an onboard experience which occurred on May
5 2004 when a lady woke up to find herself walking barefoot outside her home in
Roseville she said she was being led somewhere by a small figure towards a wooden fence she couldn't see this
figure she felt like she was just Cooperative there was no fear involved
and she said she was led to a sort of metal ladder type device and climbed up into it into a very small 8ft wide room
with smooth metal walls and a bench around the perimeter of the room she did
see another man and woman sitting on the bench she saw a round port hole and she
stood up and looked out of it and she was shocked to see the scenery outside was moving and wobbling cuz the inside
of the craft she did not feel any movement but she's looking at this and saw that they were approaching an
overpass quite quickly and this freaked her out so she screamed out a warning
and she heard a telepathic voice saying in her head quiet that one down now the
next thing she knew it was morning and she was in bed again she felt no fear during this whole experience and
afterwards didn't think about it kind of went out of her mind but she did recall
it and later wondered if this might have been a dream though she also wondered if she had been taken on board a craft and
that's what prompted her to report this to newfork she told nobody else not even
her husb husband now here's a recent and very impressive sighting this was at
4:14 a.m. on April 8 2016 as a highway patrol officer left his job in
Roseville and as he's going away he says quote a giant black triangular object
descended from the clouds with three bright white lights like lights that would light up a stadium abruptly turned
came about 30 feet and hovered directly above me and then disappeared into the
dark morning Sky the object was gigantic at least 10 times bigger than a
747 jumbo jet it had three bright white lights at each end and a big red light
in the middle the object was completely silent not a sound dark black and solid
the Triangular object was gigantic and it frightened me now this sounds to me a
lot like a tr3b reverse engineered I wasn't there I of course I can't say for
sure but the officer says he checked the radar in his Cruiser saw nothing unusual
said this object hovered for about 1 minute before disappearing and then 2
minutes later a black military helicopter began to circle the area
clearly looking for this object and as a police officer he noted that this was
not a police helicopter this was an unmarked black military helicopter of
some kind final case from Rose Ville actually turns out to be a photographic case this occurred on May 1st
2022 when a woman woke up at around 4:30 a.m. and noticed two very bright golden
orbs outside her window she thought that was strange so she vowed to check back
and she woke up an hour later 5:30 a.m. and they were still there although they looked even closer slightly higher in
the sky so she snapped a photograph of them she checked again at 6:30 and they
were gone now she was facing Northeast she did notice one other detail there
appear appeared to be an aura or haze around them so perhaps these were stars
or planets under very clear conditions you can make up your own mind about it here's the photograph but certainly an
interesting case there you go k Roseville definitely does have UFO
activity quite a variety of it super interesting I'm always surprised to find
how many cases do involve multiple Witnesses always love it when a witness is a trained Observer like a police
officer I think that raises the level of credibility of a case but fascinating
stuff so much UFO activity wherever you look I'm telling you there's a history
of UFOs and the next location is sholo
Arizona this is by special request of Greg I did find just a few cases it's
not a huge place but I will tell you one of these cases is a really impressive
humanoid case and so unusual I definitely think you'll find it
fascinating this very interesting encounter involves a type of ET a
description of an ET that I'm not sure I've ever heard before was after seeing Peter Jennings report about UFOs on
television that the witness decided to come forward with her story I'll just quarter directly as she says in the
summer of 1988 my then husband and our children set out to a law enforcement
track meet in sholo Arizona my husband was a deputy and was on the track team
after the meet we rented a room at a local two-story Motel our room was
upstairs and sort of in the middle of the building that evening we were all in bed and asleep by midnight my three
children slept on the bed that was closest to the door and my husband and I slept on the bed next to them with me
being on the west side of the bed sometime in those early hours I awoke to
see two large sized alien men walk through the wall coming from the room
just south of ours they walked through the wall through the dresser and the television as they approached the foot
of our bed they stopped and looked at me by this time I was totally paralyzed and
terrified I could not scream move or alert my husband in any way I feared for
our lives and especially my children as these being stood there watching me and my family I could see that they both had
to be at least 6' 5 in or taller they were very muscular but yet very lean no
body fat and both were wearing body armor now strangest of all was the way
their faces looked because as the witness says I noticed their color one was a bluish gray and the other was a
reddish gray color these two also had a face like a horse their mouth and nose
came out just like a horse or a dog as I looked at the one that was reddish gray
he looked at me and mentally told me it's okay we're just passing through
after which time I think I passed out now the rotness reports that she
blocked the incident from her conscious mind for some time didn't remember it in fact for many years she never told her
husband or her children and here's another very interesting case which occurred around 10 p.m.
1996 a lady was in her home this is in the small town of koncho in rural Apache
County just about 23 miles east of sholo so I included it here she was
entertaining three guests when one of them jumped up shouted an exploitive and said did you see that he excitedly
explained that he had just seen a UFO apparently on fire stre downward across
the sky looking like it was coming in for a crash landing now another guest
said that she also saw this same object confirmed the exact same details so all
four of them ran outside and decided to go drive off in a jeep towards where they had seen this object go down and
after crossing highway 61 They Came Upon an elderly couple who had also parked
along the highway and were staring off into this field so they stopped and the
couple asked them if they had seen the UFO crash they told them that they were driving West down Highway 61 when they
actually saw this object come down and they pointed to the area where they saw it go down so for the next hour the
witnesses continued towards this site via an old Cattle Trail until They Came
Upon a deep Canyon they couldn't go any further but at the bottom of this Canyon to their amazement was apparently this
crash UFO as the owner of the house says quote
it was an oblong egg shape the color was strange it was the color of a Caucasian
skin with a fading tan and it faintly glowed he said this object appeared to
have what looked like two pillars side by side as though framing a doorway was
about 50 ft across there was a pickup truck near the object and a helicopter
landed nearby they watched it for for a while but there was no visible activity
so they decided to return home now the witness does report but she has seen UFOs before but had always been alone
alone and that this was her first sighting with other witnesses there you
go Greg sholo definitely showed up and how about that last case Landing or a
possible even UFO crash retrieval hard to say for sure don't have a whole lot
of information about it but definitely fascinating now let's move to our next
location which is by special request of Jeff Jeff you asked me to look into
Littleton Massachusetts and I'm glad you did and well I found mostly only
sightings some of these were so interesting so I hope you find it
interesting too the first Littleton case I could find occurred at 300 p.m. on July 5 1954 to a 16-year-old girl by the
name of Judy balour she was at summer camp in Littleton and was laying out on
the lawn when she saw this spherical shaped object quite large about the quarter size of a full moon it was
moving silently across the sky from north to south just beneath the clouds now there was no visible wind or she
couldn't feel any wind the clouds were still so this did not appear to her to be a balloon of any kind furthermore she
described seeing this saturn-like ring on the lower section of the object
almost at the base of it uh she reported the encounter to the police uh they
refused to take the sighting seriously but the newspaper did take the report and wrote it up in the next issue a
really interesting case was investigated by researcher Raymond Fowler it was one
evening in Autumn of 1964 when there were two teenagers James Gates and John t-bolt and their
12-year-old friend Norman G sheldrick they were driving through Littleton when
they saw this strange object hovering over an area known as the common this
object they said was silver gray about 100 ft wide oval in shape the two
reddish pulsating lights on either side and one in the middle and it was moving
along so they chased it in their car for a few miles outside of the city to
Porter field and at this point they got to about within 500 ft of it close enough that
they could hear it making a quote soft roaring sound they said when it moved it
moved with a strange quote fluttering motion so at this point they got out of
their car to walk up to it when it suddenly sped away over the Treetops and was gone but later Raymond Fowler did
locate a fourth witness a 14-year-old by the name of John Marino turns out his
bedroom window overlooked Porter field where the others had seen this object
and he saw it too he looked outside his window saw apparently the same object he
said it was hovering about 200 F feet above the ground he watched it for about a minute before it darted off so pretty
good confirmation on that sighting the next one occurred about a half hour after midnight on August 13
1982 two friends were driving South on 495 near Littleton when they noticed an
unusually large light in the sky which appeared to be moving towards them so as
it moved over their car and out of view they decided to stop the car to get a better look and as they did this is when
they noticed something strange the whole area was quote extraordinarily strangely quiet they
noticed that all the traffic which had been there was now suddenly gone this object was directly overhead they
disagreed a little bit on the shape of it whether it was rectangular or diamond shaped but it was covered with lights
around the perimeter quite low they couldn't say exactly how low it was but they're estimating about 400 ft above
them nearly the size of a football field totally silent they watch it for 20
seconds when it's moved off slowly a short distance and then suddenly darted
away at quote impossible speed as the witness says we were left stunned one of
the most amazing parts of the experience was that I felt no real desire to speak to anyone about it the next day or
thereafter my friend told me he felt the same way so he didn't report it until 19
years later when he reported to the National UFO Reporting Center but that does sound like a genuine encounter with
that weird Oz effect the desire not to talk about it the way this this craft
was covered with lights and here's another much more recent November 11
2015 was 5:15 p.m. as three people saw this
strange object and it came right over the Littleton Police Station they
watched this now the sun was still shining at this point but they could see that this object was glowing internally
oval-shaped and had a bright metallic blue band glowing around it totally
silent they said it move very fast they saw it zip ahead and maybe about a
matter of 3 seconds it came down low right above the tree line and as it was
going to land and it looked like it was actually going to crash they thought when something very unusual happened
this object appeared to split into three separate equalized oval-shaped objects
which continued to Glide along the tree line and then suddenly moved off so fast they weren't sure if they disappeared or
darted away all right Jeff there you go as you can see there are sightings over
Littleton that one over the police station was particularly impressive it's not every day you hear about a UFO
flying that low right over a police station I always wonder what these UFOs
are up to but I think if we gather enough cases enough evidence we'll eventually figure it all out I certainly
hope so so it's one of the reasons I do this research I know a lot of you out there are having
encounters and now we go to our last and final location in this episode of UFOs
over your hometown and this one is by special request of the and the
I gave you cuts in line because you donated a super sticker donation so thank you so much I think it definitely
warrants a cut in line and don't worry you guys for all of you who have are
still waiting I'm going down this list as fast as I can I am going to be putting out more episodes but Theon you
asked me to look into bastri Texas and into Bergstrom field Bergstrom Air Base
found some really cool cases this is a tiny little town and I was surprised to
find that many there so thank you and I hope you find this interesting first case I could find occurred at 4:30 p.m.
on July 8th 1947 this is right almost at the same time as the Roswell UFO crash main witness is
Sergeant CF Clifton he's a Bergstrom field radio man and he was taking off in
a plane when he and his crew saw a classic round Flying Saucer as sergeant Clifton says I think
it was about 18 ft in diameter and it looked as though it was made of glass was extremely bright and kept flashing
the disc seemed to be spinning as it flew it blurred radio reception slightly
so it was flying fast in fact they estimated it was flying at about 1400 milph because they as they watched it
quickly overtook their plane flying at a slightly tilted angle the next case
occurred on June 1st 1965 7 p.m. a B-52 crew member and his friend
were both working at the nuclear alert facility at the end of the runway again at Bergstrom field bu they were standing
on the patio when as the B-52 crew member says quote all of a sudden a
shape started going from Southwest to Northeast it was saucer shaped with
lighted port hole type Windows was so huge and going so slowly that I wondered
how it could sustain flight we looked at each other and Shrugged our shoulders we
dared not say anything to each other much less the higher up because if nothing else we could lose
our top secret clearance and hence our jobs can you imagine what a shame here
they are seeing something absolutely incredible and they can't talk about it this is the damage the coverup is doing
to all of us and here's another amazing case which occurred on January 2nd 1980
as newsman buddy price and his wife were driving along Highway 290 between Bast
STP and Gidding without any warning both of them saw two
objects moving well over they estimate 10,000 miles per hour across the sky or
faster as Buddy says I've never seen any plane that could travel that fast this
is something I definitely can't explain I feel it was a UFO and was traveling
much faster than any type of aircraft that Any Nation claims to have
developed now he did learn that one year earlier in 1979 a man from Giddings was driving
towards bastrup in the same exact area when he also saw UFO at the time there
were many flaring oil and gas wells in the area and Buddy wonders if perhaps
this is what was attracting UFOs the next case occurred at 11 a.m. August 1st
1988 a man was outside his home in the backyard in the woods this is located
about 5 miles north of bastrup he had his BB pistol and this is when he saw a
metallic sphere-shaped object was traveling slowly maybe 5 mph
and very low about 10 ft above the tree line but it was moving steadily looked
like it was under power and controlled not drifting on the wind and he says it
approached about 40 ft away from the witness so he decided to lift up his pistol and open fire on it which he did
he thought he could hit it as he says I shot at it several times and then
observed it as it went out of sight beyond the trees in the front yard he's not sure if he hit it or not but as it
moved off it just went on its way and as he says I have relived this event many
times wondering just what it was that I observed I have never observed another
unexplained object since that time or before case from bastri occurred on
February 19 the witness was driving north on Highway 20 about 5 m south of
the Highway 71 intersection in bastrup when he saw a saucer-shaped object which
he said was moving very fast in a straight line from east to west it
looked to him kind of like a frying pan with no handle slightly wider at the top than the bottom and as he washed it
would change from white to Silver pulsating and at times becoming almost
trans parent he watched it for about 30 seconds when suddenly it swooped upwards
and into a small Cloud this was a very thin small Cloud there were just a few other clouds in the sky so he waited for
it to come out of the cloud but it never did and as he watched this Cloud sort of broke up and dissolved and of course the
object was gone here's another really interesting case which occurred at 9:00
p.m. on July 12th 2014 anoun witness said that they saw a
metallic cylindrical object about 20 to 25 ft wide with a light at each hand and
as they watched it flew silently at a very low elevation 200 ft directly above
the open field behind the Lowe's hardware store and as the witness says in his own words this cylinder was
flying so fast it was over the horizon in less than 10 seconds I've never seen
anything fly this fast as it ascended and gained altitude I presume it had
landed and was taking off there were no propellers rotors wings or jets although
the setting was only seconds long I got a good look at it and another man in a
white SUV was staring with his mouth open in apparent near shock thanks again
the I really enjoyed learning about the sightings and encounters over
bastrup in Bergstrom field the Texas guy who shot his pistol at the UFO that's in
true Texas style that was certainly interesting I loved the case involving the gentleman who had top secret
clearance seeing a classic Flying Saucer zipping by their plane stuff like that I
mean it's hard to deny that there is something truly going on here so there
you go UFOs over your hometown UFOs are visiting every place on this planet and
it's not just s as we see there's Landings there's face to-face encounters with humanoids there's onboard
encounters there is so much going on here and this is just the tip of the
iceberg I'm almost 100% positive that all of these locations have far far more
encounters than I've covered here I know some do because I saw them I didn't
cover them because they're very simple sightings of anomalous lights not terribly interesting don't add a whole
lot to our knowledge but they do show that every location on this planet is
being visited said it before but that's why I'm doing this episode to prove this
point Skeptics really don't have a leg to stand on they just haven't looked at
the evidence they have not done their research no matter where you look there's a long history of UFO
encounters so I will soon be doing episode 4 if you have a location send it
off to me in the notes on this video or you can email me my email is pretty easy
to remember Preston UFO gmail.com and I will put it on my list you'll have to be
patient because like I said this list is over 300 locations but I'm not giving up and
hopefully some of you guys can stump me I don't think so cuz so far I'm batting
100% all right thanks guys for watching I truly appreciate it and until next
time keep searching for the truth keep asking those hard questions and most important
of all keep having fun and I will see you next Friday bye for now
