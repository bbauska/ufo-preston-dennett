SHOCKING ET ENCOUNTERS: TEN TRUE CASES
Nov 29, 2024

Summary:
Nov 29, 2024
It’s one of the most shocking and surprising experiences a person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid. It almost always has a profound impact on a witness, forever changing the way they think about the Universe. This video presents ten shocking alien encounters from across the planet, each providing important insights into the nature of extraterrestrial contact.

THE MAN IN THE SPHERE. In 1930, Yakov Tabunshikov was only thirteen when he stepped outside his home near Simferopol, Ukraine and witnessed an amazing sight: coming up behind the roof of his neighbor’s house was a transparent sphere, and inside it was a man in a white jumpsuit. Yakov watched in awe as the man in the sphere floated around the neighborhood and finally moved away. 

THE LITTLE BLUE MAN OF STUDHAM COMMON. On January 28, 1967, a group of young boys were playing outside their school in Studham Common, Bedfordshire, UK. Suddenly a little blue man in a glowing jumpsuit appeared. The boys ran towards him and he vanished in a puff of smoke. He soon reappeared and vanished again three more times, leaving behind an enduring mystery.

THE INDIFFERENT EXTRATERRESTRIALS. Around sunset on August 28, 1968, Juan Gascon del Toro was bicycling through a rural area of Aldaia, Spain when he came upon a landed UFO. Several humanoid figures in divers’ suits stood by it. Juan stopped his bike and stared in shock. Weirdly, the humanoids stared back at him and seemed not to care that they were being observed. Overcome with fear, Juan fled the scene.

THE VERY TALL ALIENS. On the evening of January 19, 1979, Andrea X was driving near Bastia, Italy when his car stalled. Getting outside to check the engine, he noticed two odd-looking figures standing nearby. He paid them no attention until the next day when he was driving in the same area and again his car stalled. The same two figures were there. Looking at them, he saw they were not human. His car would not start until the figures departed.

I NEARLY RAN OVER AN ALIEN. One evening in the Spring of 1980, a family of four was driving to their home in Cassville, Missouri when they saw a flying saucer landed in a field. As they watched it, suddenly a figure appeared in front of the car. It was a gray alien. The father had to swerve the car to avoid hitting it. This turned out to be one of a series of cases of landings and humanoids.

UFO LANDS IN FARMER’S FIELD. On the morning of September 4, 1987 farmers Armando and Rosa were in their beanfield in Balsamo, Brazil when a UFO appeared overhead. Rosa ran in fear, but Armando stayed outside and saw the craft come in for a landing. Then the craft tilted towards him and inside he saw two men in jumpsuits staring back at him. They had dark eyes, dark hair and looked like normal humans. Just then, his son arrived and the craft flew away.

THE TINY FLOATING MAN. One night in August 1991, El Vasco Landetcheverry and his daughter were watching TV in their home in Las Pipinas, Argentina when two bright lights appeared outside their home. Finally, El Vasco went outside to investigate. He walked into a wall of fog, and out of it floated a tiny little man the size of a coke bottle. It floated right up to him, stared at him, then floated back into the fog. The strange lights disappeared.

MEMORIES OF GRAYS. In 2001, “Alex,” (age 5) woke in the bedroom of his home in Norfolk, Virginia to see the room filling with blue light. To his shock, several small gray figures with bald heads and large dark eyes were in his room. This happened several times, and later, as a young man, Alex found himself in telepathic contact with one of the grays who imparted profound spiritual wisdom, changing his life forever.

“STAY CALM…IT’S ALRIGHT.” On the night of February 15, 2015, a woman woke in the bedroom of her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She thought she heard her boyfriend coming in, but instead it was an 8-foot-tall skinny being. The witness was scared at first, but then felt a sense of tranquility and love coming from the being. She was surprised by her own reaction of crawling back into bed as the strange creature disappeared.

THE TALE OF AN ALIEN WITH A TAIL. One sunny day in May 2016, Arfon Jones was driving along Tannyoky Road in County Armagh, Northern Ireland when he saw a strange figure standing in the road in front of him. He drove up to it, stopped his car and stared in amazement at a tall creature with a skinny muscular body, a bald head, large dark eyes, and a long tail like a rat. To his relief, the creature ran off into the bushes. But Arfon knew his life would never be the same.

These ten cases show the dazzling variety of humanoids that our visiting our planet. These experiences have been covered up for too long. But now, as the UFO subject goes mainstream, the truth is coming out. All humanity faces the fact that we are not alone in this universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal today's episode is called shocking extraterrestrial encounters 10
true cases I call this shocking because I think that is a very common reaction
people have when they see ETS face to face it's pretty much without exception
very shocking quite surprising and I think that's true in all of these cases
which yes I think are true the cases I've chosen are again more obscure cases
cases you probably haven't heard of a few are somewhat wellknown but I'd be surprised if you've heard of all of
these or even most of these I do like choosing cases from all over the world
and that's certainly true for this episode I've got cases from Stam UK from
County armag in Northern Ireland bastia Italy aldia Spain simur rope Hall in
Ukraine Vancouver British Columbia Canada couple from the United States
including cville Missouri and Norfolk Virginia and of course a couple from
South America including Las pinis Argentina and balamo
Brazil I've also chosen cases from a wide period of time as early as 1930 all
the way up to 2016 and of course cases involving a wide variety of humanoids in fact some
really unusual humanoids in this one so let's just get started the first case
I'd like to talk about today is very interesting because it is a very very
early case and quite an unusual description of a UFO and humanoid it is
a firsthand single witness case and I think you'll find it really very
unusual I call this one the man in the sphere this occurred in 1930 in Sim
fural Ukraine and I wanted to include this one because it's one of several examples of this kind of spherical
shaped UFO with really nothing in it but a humanoid this first case comes from
Ukrainian researcher miky gersin and I have to give thanks also to Albert Rosal
and his amazing multivolume books humanoid encounters CU it was he that
brought this case to my attention and of course now to yours the sole witness in
this case is a well-known Ukrainian War Veteran by the name of Yakov yakovich
tabun chikov at the time of his encounter he was about 13 years old he
lived in a large Village of about 300 Homes located about 20 km outside of
sopal Ukraine and it was early one bright cool morning in 1930 he was
outside his home when he saw something amazing shocking even a 2 m wide 6 feet
wide transparent sphere with a male figure sitting in it it was coming up
from behind the roof of his neighbor's home it was so unusual he first thought
that there might be something wrong wrong with his vision and he started rubbing his eyes but of course his
vision was fine this strange sight persisted and Yakov knew he was really
seeing it and as he says I remember it clearly the ball was completely
transparent and there were no Motors it floated between ours and the neighboring
yard about 40 m from our house but the most incredible thing is that inside the
ball was a man he sat as if on a chair although no chair was visible he was
dressed in light clothing he was a middle-aged man light red beard and hair
he looked Straight Ahead seemed to be somehow coldly indifferent he didn't
even pay attention to me so Yakov was actually a little bit offended that this
man was ignoring his presence cuz he felt like this guy had to see him they were pretty close to each other so
keeping his eye on this floating sphere with a man inside it Yakov walked over
to the porch of his home just a short distance away and he observed as this man in this sphere proceeded to float
around the neighborhood after just a few more moments this sphere moved off as Yakov
says I watched it until he disappeared into the distance now strangely nobody
else was there to view this amazing incident but even at that young age
Yakov knew that he had seen something very special Z says I understood
perfectly well that this was something out of the ordinary our technology has never been able to do this what was this
a completely transparent ball without engines and in it is a man so he kept
this secret for quite some time and it was 70 years later he still remembered
it clearly and reported his experience to UFO researcher miky gersin very
interesting aspects to that case not only because it is a very very early account long before UFOs were at all
popular but the witness saw this very close up and he's a good witness a war
veteran didn't talk about it for so many years it's unusual that he's the only
witness given that this was a fairly large Village but this is a pattern we do see in a lot
of these cases I also found it interesting that these this ET that he
saw presuming ET paid no attention to him it must have known he was there it
must have known he was being observed it's another odd detail that we see in quite a few cases so let's move to the
next one and this is also a really interesting case of all the cases in this compilation this one is probably
the most famous if you're from the UK you may have heard of it because it did get a lot of press
attention but I call this one the little blue man of Stam common this is actually
what the case is well known as I like this case because not only is the
humanoid described incredibly unusual there is a fairly strong UFO connection
to it though it's certainly not your average described ET and I also like it
because there are multiple Witnesses and it's an interesting series of
events this one actually took place on January 28th 1967 again in Stam common this is in
bedfordshire UK it was a rainy afternoon January 28th 1967 it was about 1:45 p.m.
as 6 or seven young boys were walking back to school after recess through a
small Dell located at at Stam common this is in the chilon hills in
bedfordshire UK it's not far away from the whipsnade
park zoo and they were on their way back to class suddenly a flash of lightning
struck and immediately this is when one of the boys 10-year-old Alex Butler saw
quote a little blue man with a tall hat and a beard he was standing just a short
distance away Alex was immediately struck by the strange appearance of this little fellow and he pointed it out to
his friends all of them were amazed so they on mass started to run towards this
figure these Witnesses include Tony Banks Carrie Gill Colin Lonsdale David
englas Andrew and John melberg all of them were around 10 or 11 years old
so completely shocked by the appearance of this little man they all ran towards it to get a closer look and they did
they could see that this figure had roundish eyes sort of flat triangular nose a long forked almost bluish beard
that went right down to his chest short arms which lay unmoving along its sides
it was about 3T tall and had a tall hat or domed helmet of some kind which
increased its height a little bit the figure's body or its clothes
were a dark gray blue but had a sort of gleaming or almost glowing quality to it
they did see what appeared to be a large belt hanging Loosely down from its waist
and they could see that this belt had a small 6in wide box type device attached
to it so they run towards this figure who's not moving at all and they got
within 60 ft of it when it quote disappeared in a puff of smoke they
described this smoke or mist as yellow and blue and it seemed to possibly be
coming out or being emitted from that little box on its chest they couldn't tell for sure but this mist or smoke
moved towards the boys as the creature disappeared so they were of course
shocked and they started running around looking for any evidence of this little guy and it was just moments later that
they did they saw him again but now he was on the opposite side of the Bush where they had first seen him they're
not sure if he ran away or if he disappeared and reappeared but again
they all ran towards him and once again as they got close he promptly
disappeared but this time he almost instantly reappeared for a third time
and this is when events went from very strange to truly bizarre because they
now all heard voices that they said sounded like they were speaking in a quote foreign sounding Babel these
voices were deep toned continuous and seemed to be coming from a group of nearby bushes the figure disappeared and
reappeared a fourth time but now hearing these voices and seeing this figure so
many times the boys were beginning to feel increasingly nervous and Afraid and
they were wary to approach this figure any closer and this is when the school whistle sounded so they fled back as a
group to the school now upon arriving at their school their teacher Miss newcom
could very clearly see that all her students were very excited and nervous
and she asked them what was wrong now as a group they at first refused to answer saying only you'll never believe us so
this frustrated her and finally she decided to just separate the boys and ask them individually what happened and
hearing them she had them write down exactly what they saw to her amazement
they all told essentially the same story with minor differences in details but
the stories were corroborated by each other to such an extent that Miss newom was absolutely convinced they were
telling the truth and she ended up putting these accounts together in a little booklet titled the little blue
man of Stam common and it was this booklet that eventually found its way to UFO researchers a number of them
including Gordon kraton editor of the Flying Saucer review Charles Bowen one
of the first people to ever write about humanoids and other researchers who after investigating learned that there
was in fact a UFO connection because there had been UFO sightings recently in
this area including reportedly two UFO Landings in that exact area in the
months following this boy's these boys encounter
so cuz there's some speculation that maybe was a fairy or an elf or something along those lines but with the UFO
connection well there you go researcher RH Brian Winder ended up writing an
article for flying saucer review about the case and he was able to question the boys directly and came away absolutely
convinced of their sighting and as he says nobody who knows the boys disputes
that it really happened now the area where this sighting occurred is well known for FL
deposits also important is on that day several residents of the village did
note the very unusual weather some reported to hearing loud bangs rushes of
wind what they thought were Sonic booms and even really odd sounding thunder so
perhaps that is related hard to say for sure but certainly a fascinating
encounter say that's a Fairly reliable case given that there are so many witnesses uh a UFO
connection also I find it interesting that a number of people in that area reported how unusual that day was in
terms of the weather and all the stuff that was going on it's an interesting case again you
always have to speculate you know why there could it be the Flint deposits in that area because that is a connection
we do see in some cases where ETS or UFOs are attracted to mineral deposits
mines what have you pure speculation but I do wonder about it now let's move to the next case which
is also really interesting I call this one the indifferent extraterrestrials this occurred on
August 28 1968 in alia Spain I think I'm pronouncing that
correctly I like this case CU although it is a single witness case and the witness only saw these ETS briefly uh
it's a landed UFO it's humanoids seen very close up and again we have this
weird pattern of these beings not caring apparently that they were being observed
by an outside witness it's a really unusual case this shocking case comes
from Spanish researcher viente Juan balester Almos and was published in his
book loses e lenia UFOs and science it was 8:00 p.m. on the evening
of August 28 1968 as a handyman by the name of Juan
gascon Del Toro was returning from a hunting foray in the ma de P pasture
lands this is located in ela Valencia Spain and Juan was riding his bicycle
coming around a corner he immediately noticed a very strange looking object or
craft landed in a field a short distance away about 300 ft or 100 m I was very
obvious to him that this was a craft it was oval kind of football shaped it sat
on three or four Landing legs it was a silvery gray metallic color and was
refle reflecting quote like a white shining seat in the sun which was Now
setting but even more amazing standing next to this craft were several short
figures who the witness Juan first assumed were young children but as he
rode his bike closer he could see this object more clearly and these figures
and he got to within about 120 ft 40 m and stopped his bike and got off because
he could see this was very strange and he wanted to get a better look he could now see that this craft was about 24 ft
wide almost 10 ft High 8 m wide 3 m tall The Landing legs were quite prominent
about a third of a meter high two ft he says the top of the craft had a shiny
protrusion on it from which a sort of antenna like device came out he also
said that the this craft had a small opening or doorway about 1.5 M tall Less
Than 3 feet which is odd because this is shorter than the humanoids themselves it
had a small ladder which extended down to the ground he counted about four rungs to this ladder but yeah the beings
were very short he says about 1.5 M 4
1/2 ft tall or so and he could now see of course that they were definitely not
children two of them were standing in the doorway area the others were standing on the ground next to the craft
but each of them were dressed very strangely in what looked to him like divers suits white and color white boots
helmets with small thin dark visors but from the mouth area he saw what looked
like a rubber looking hose which extended down and connected to their chest area apparently some kind of
breathing device their suits also had wide belts strapped around their chests
which were slightly darker than the rest of their Suits now strangely although one must
have been absolutely visible to these beings they remained completely
indifferent to his presence they did look at him they looked directly at him but did not appear to care that he was
looking right back at them they did not react to his presence in any way so
realizing how strange all of this was one decided that his best course of action was to just get out of there he
jumped back on his bike and left in fact as he left these beings and this craft
were still there so he did not see them leave and he estimated that this entire
en enounter he observed was no longer than one minute there you go another
case of humanoids next to an landed craft I do think we're dealing with ETS
in most of these cases perhaps not all hard to say for sure just presenting the
evidence as we know it gosh there are so many cases that was a good one and
here's another one which I find really compelling cuz although this is a single witness case it does involve
electromagnetic effects it involves actually two incidents in the same darn
place it's a really unusual case I call this one the very tall aliens and this
occurred on January 19 1979 in bastia
Italy well actually January 19th and January 20 as we shall see and you can
make up your own minds about it but wow this is a weird weird one this very interesting and unusual case comes from
Italian researcher Moreno tambellini and was published in his book UFO a aleni in
Italia UFOs and aliens in Italy the sole witness is a worker by the name of
Andrea was around 12:30 a.m. on January 19
1979 as Andrea drove his Fiat between the two towns of bastia and isorel
this is about a 4-Hour drive and coming around a curve his car mysteriously
failed so he got out open the hood to check the engine and while he was doing
this he casually noticed two figures who looked pretty unusual standing behind a
nearby electrical pylon alongside the road they were looking at him he says
but he didn't pay too much attention to them cuz he thought that they were just two electrical
workers so he closed the hood to his car tried to restart the engine and was able
to do so he says he did feel slightly dazed and a little bit out of sorts but
made it home but the next day he was driving the same route again at night
and came around the same exact corner and lo and behold his car engine failed
again and there were the same two figures or at least looked the same only
this time they were glowing a bit more with this weird Eerie green light so now
he's taking a closer look at them and was really shocked and a little bit frightened to see that these were not
human looking in fact one appeared to be about 7 and 1/2 ft tall 2.5 M and had an
immense and robust frame or torso the other figure was a little bit
shorter but both were dressed very strangely wearing what looked like skintight very light colored metallic
looking shining jumpsuits they appeared to have sort of hoobs or something crisscrossing around
these jumpsuits and again both Figures were glowing with this odd greenish light and they were looking right at him
they stared at him for just a few moments and then turned and walked into the woods he didn't get to see their
faces he says it appeared almost as though they were walking back backwards so maybe he was looking at
their backs he's really not sure but they walked in a strange way as well so
he was frightened at this point very concerned about being broken down along this highway he tried several times to
restart his car as all this was going on but it would not work but immediately
after these beings left he was able to restart his engine with no problems and drove
off now he did contact researchers and researchers later discovered that there
was in fact another witness who said he saw a bright bluish light descending
into the forest in the same area around the same time so although Andrea did not
see a UFO someone else did and it's very possibly true that these two events are
connected yeah unfortunately the witness did not see a craft but someone else did
I do wonder what those ETS were doing there can only imagine what it must be like to have your car break down late at
night and lo and behold there's a 7 and 1/2 foot tall figure not too far away
looking at you that's got to be quite a shock all right let's move to the next
case in this compilation this is probably one of my favorites I've got a few but this one is super interesting it
was initially I was only going to present one event but there were several that seemed to be connected to it that
they all occurred in roughly the same area I call this one I nearly ran over
an alien and this is a multiple witness case I wish I could talk to the witness
directly because I do have a few questions about it but wow such a closeup observation of not only a landed
craft but an apparent extraterrestrial this one took place in the spring of
1980 in the small town of cville missoui Missouri very small town what's also
interesting is again this is not the only incident that has taken place there
I'm going to cover a few other Landings uh some really amazing Landing Trace
cases and of course another humanoid encounter so yeah really cool all the
events that are going on in this one area the first case in this amazing series of events comes from researcher
Ted Phillips who is best known of course for his Research into UFO landing Trace
cases and this case actually involves four Witnesses John Melton his wife and
their two teenage kids was one evening in the spring of 1980 and they were
driving to their home in cville Missouri after attending a baseball game and they
were going down this Gravel Road when John's wife was the first to see a sort
of glowing dome-shaped object landed in the field about 300 ft away from them
pretty close so they all looked at it it absolutely captured their attention it
was very unusual looking and all of them were watching it with so much interest
that they nearly did not notice a strange little man standing alongside the road right in front of their vehicle
until JN very nearly hit this figure with his car and in fact Jon had to
Swerve to avoid hitting it they all turned and saw this figure and said it was about the size of a small slender
child they did only see it for a few brief seconds as John swerved the car
but it was long enough to see that this figure was wearing a light colored suit of some kind John was so frightened by
its unusual appearance that he did not stop the car and instead he slammed down
the accelerator and fled the scene as fast as his car could go he did look
back briefly and saw that this little man was now being leered by the gravel being spewed up from his spinning tires
was actually running back towards the object in the field this so frightened them they didn't stop they just went
straight home they never returned to the site but this was reported to researcher
Ted Phillips and he learned that there had in fact been other sightings in the area in fact going back some years 14
years earlier on November 22nd 1966 there was an amazing case which caught
the attention of Jay Allen heck who brought in Ted Phillips this was also
researched extensively by researcher Billy Booth this case involved two deer
hunters who had gone with friends to go out hunting they had been away from their campsite for about an hour though
someone had seen it a half hour earlier and did not notice anything unusual but
coming back to their campsite it was around around 10 p.m. again November 22nd
1966 they were about 300 ft away from their campsite when they noticed a thin
column of smoke coming up from it this obviously concerned them so they ran up
to the area and the main witness known only by his initials JB saw that his
tent and a pair of leather shoes and quite a bit of other equipment was all
burned up destroyed still smoking and in fact a 15t tall dead tree next to the
campsite was burning at the very top it was weird because the tent was actually
set up underneath two other trees which were directly above the tent and they were
undamaged so JB looked inside the tent he could see all his equipment burnt up there were two aluminum CS that were
completely melted so he's looking at this damage trying to figure out what had happened and this is what he heard a
low humming noise he immediately looked up towards it and saw this object rising
from a small Valley just beyond the tent not far away about 300 ft when he first
saw it it was just above the horizon line now JB carries a camera in the
hopes of photographing Wildlife while he's hunting so he grabbed his camera and immediately snapped two photographs
one of which clearly shows this object as if it climbed upwards gaining speed
and disappeared and he says that as this craft went upwards it made a humming
sound which increased in Pitch he said it was silver metallic had what looked
like a dark band around the center of it kind of antenna towards the rear section swept back it was a fairly large craft
he estimates about 25 ft wide and 8 ft thick you can see the photograph here
the sighting was pretty brief it lasted about 20 seconds but after this craft
had left about 15 minutes later as if in response two jet fighters made a low low
pass right over the area and flew off and Away now the witnesses and frankly the
researchers are convinced that the UFO was responsible for the burned damage to
the tent and the equipment damage which totaled about $600 and very interesting inter inly it
was this exact case which inspired Ted Phillips to focus his research on
Landing Trace cases and he would soon become the leading researcher in landing
Trace cases now this was in the Roaring River area located just south of cille I
mean like 3 to 5 miles away and there are other sightings in this area CU it
was 12 years after this sighting and two years before that other humanoid sighting that I cited earlier about 15
miles away in Ko Missouri it was 700 a.m. early morning October 8
1978 that marlot Sturgill and his family noticed a white metallic aluminum object
in their field now they didn't pay much attention to it at first uh they did
notice it was unusual one of them thought maybe it was a cow or something or an animal another
thought it might be something that had fallen from a plane but they really weren't paying much attention to it and
it sat there for a couple of hours until it really started to capture their attention because they noticed that
their cow and the calf were watching this object and also so was a coyote who
was crouched and watching it so they all gathered to watch this object six of
them and try to figure out what this was it was a few hundred feet away and now
realizing it's quite unusual three of them including marlot Sturgill his son
Dorman and one other person approached this object and as they started to get
close to it it suddenly Rose upwards when over a nearby walnut tree climbed
at an upward angle into the sky and hovered in place it said it was an
elongated oval shape no higher than 4 feet one of the witnesses Francis Morgan
said it looked like quote a big washtub a big round thing marlot Sturgill said
quote it looked like a big aircraft it was long just laying there Motionless In
The Sky so it took off pretty quickly after that so they called the sheriff they
investigated the landing spot and did in fact find a 4T diameter circle of
scorched discolored grass swirled in a clockwise Direction part of it at least
and and what looked like tripod marks soil samples were taken and an
analysis showed exposure to high heat but no radiation no unusual elements
though this ring would remain visible for months afterwards and it turns out
there was quite a bit of activity going on in that area because 4 days later and
just a few miles away the Everett Smith family saw what was apparently the same
object object as it hovered over their yard for a full 30 minutes and they also
found a discolored patch of vegetation in their field that matched that of the
Sturgill family meanwhile about 50 mil to the Southwest in McDonald County a
man and his wife were in their pickup truck When They Came Upon a strange craft sitting on a hill a short distance
away so they're watching it trying to figure out what this is when suddenly they notice that they are being
approached by a humanoid figure wearing a onepiece suit and per Ted Phillips who
investigated this case this figure was your typical gray 4 feet tall a large
bald head gray skin large eyes and as this figure got closer and closer the
couple realized this is not a normal human being so they quickly drove off so
I don't know exactly what the attraction is in this area but it's definitely
drawing in quite a bit of UFO activity so although these UFO events didn't
occur at the same time they're very much in the same area which really does raise
questions as to what is it about this area that is attracting UFOs I don't know I suspect that these
encounters are happening everywhere and we're linking them together only because we're hearing about them but that there
are a lot more cases we just don't hear about said it before I think UFOs and
ETS are being seen everywhere on this planet the more I dig into this the more
I think the evidence shows this there are just so many cases because here's
another one this is a really poignant case involving an older Farm couple who
had a very close-up encounter with a UFO that was hovering over their field and eventually landed and yep they saw human
oids as well well at least the husband did and their son I call this one UFO
lands in Farmers field this occurred on September 4 1987 in balsama Brazil it's
not a well-known case certainly deserves to be because it's quite compelling it's
a daylight encounter seen very close up and just an amazing case
overall this case has three Witnesses and got some some good publicity after
it occurred the Witnesses are Armando his wife Rosa and their son who is
unamed and if you see the video of these people describing their encounter you can see how sincere they are they owned
a large bean farm and on the morning of September 4 1987 they had worked their field all
morning and it was around 11 a.m. that they were returning to have lunch again
this is in balsamo Brazil so as they're walking towards their Farmhouse Rosa
noticed that the plants around them were being stirred around in an unusual way and at the same time the shadow of
something overhead swept by them and looking up they could see this strange
object hovering at a very low altitude moving in a strange whirling wobbling
motion coming first closer to them and then backing away Maria was absolutely
shocked and Afraid and shouted out my God what could it be she said that she
immediately thought to herself this is something from another world neither of
them had seen anything like this before was really shocking for them and at this
point the object whizzed overhead at a very high speed went right over their heads but was totally silent was no
higher they said than 60 ft above them and as it moved off it stopped hovered
and began flashing colored lights at them red blue white lights it then
started darting around in various directions very quickly over their property this only served to increase
Rosa's fear and she told her husband I'm leaving and she started to make a run
for The Farmhouse but her husband Armando was very curious and unafraid he
told Rosa that she could go home but he was going to follow this craft and try to identify it so he walked up up to it
but each time he got at all close to it would zigzag off to another Direction
and hover over another spot on their property and this went on for the next 5 minutes him walking around in vain
trying to get closer to this object when finally it did stop hovered about 150 ft
away and began to lower to the ground he said it was making these weird very
sudden back and forth sideways motions and finally fin reached just above the
ground almost or actually touching the ground now Armando could now see that
this was an almost perfectly round object with a sort of oval section on
top it was at this point he said it tilted towards him and began to actually
glow so Armando crept even closer towards it and he was amazed cuz he
could now actually see inside a transparent Dome section on top of this
object object and inside he said he saw two men who were very much human looking
humanoid in shape he said that they did have very long large dark eyes and he
wondered if these were in fact their eyes or perhaps some kind of eye protection like sunglasses he couldn't
be sure he could only see them from the waist up but he said that they were wearing a thick black fabric all of One
Piece that didn't quite look like cloth he couldn't really identify what it was made made out of but he did see that
these figures had black hair on their heads he said it was weird because his object seemed to almost vibrate and
looking inside of it he saw this weird little sphere almost like crystall
looking ball with a glowing reddish light around it so as he's watching this
in absolute amazement his son started to arrive on Horseback to the farm
according to one report one of the figures actually got out but I have to say in Armando's verbal testimony he did
not mention this so I don't know at any rate Armando's son saw this object too
and was absolutely amazed and began to approach at which point this object immediately darted upwards at an
extremely high speed and that was the last they saw of it it never returned
though Armando does say that the next day he was quite nervous about it and wondered if the object would return and
his wife Rosa said that she remained fearful for days afterwards she said
whatever they saw it was not natural at all she said it was a strange thing that she had never seen before and could not
explain and actually see firsthand interviews with both these Witnesses I
looked them up the interviews are in Portuguese their native language but of course these days any language can be
fairly easily translated so if you want to look that up it's certainly interesting to hear
from the witnesses directly now let's move to another case which I had to include because it's just
so bizarre so unusual I call this one the tiny floating man we do get a lot of
cases involving diminutive really tiny ETS and this is definitely one of them
and a lot of cases of flying humanoids and this fits both those categories this
took place one evening in August 1991 in Las penis
Argentina and technically there's only one witness to the actual humanoid but
there were two witnesses to the UFO that was involved in this case turns out
there was actually a series of sightings but what an unusual case as you shall
see the investigator for this case is Louie Bergos of the Argentina Foundation
of youology so yes this case was professionally investigated the witness
is known as elasco land he's a popular resident of the town
of Las pinis this is near buis RS Argentina and elasco owned a small
restaurant there so he is a well-respected well-liked resident of this town it was around 900 p.m. one
evening in August of 1991 that elasco and his daughter were watching television in their living room and it
was her who first noticed a strange light that seemed to be approaching the gate to their house about 300 ft away so she
pointed it out to her father and the two of them looked out the window and they could now see that the source of this
illumination was two brilliant lights which they first thought might be
headlights from a truck headlights on high beams but these were bright enough to illuminate the side of their house
and they weren't moving they just kind of remained in place for several minutes so finally elasco told his daughter that
he was going to go outside and check and see what's going on now she was
immediately nervous about this and warned him to be careful and she remained inside but looked out the
window watching what was going on so he went outside and walked towards
the gate again this is in the evening and he was surprised to walk right up to
this thick almost 6t wall high of mist which seemed to appear out of nowhere
and covered the area completely in front of him so elasco shouted out two or
three times asking who was there but nobody responded at this point he still
had no fear there was no reason to fear he was just curious but as this fog
began to swirl around him this is when he noticed a small dark shape floating
towards him directly from the Mist where these lights were by his gate and this
small little object was hovering about 3 feet above the ground it was at this
point that elasco noticed that the environment around him was very strangely and completely
silent so as this little object moved closer alasco was absolutely shocked and
amazed to see that this dark shape was actually a quote tiny man he says it was
no bigger than a coke bottle he said it looked like a normal person had a very slim body looked perfectly human except
for its tiny size it was wearing a strange tight fitting outfit that did
not appear to be cloth he said it did have dark hair that looked like it was combed and slicked back he said it had
two small eyes like two black dots a straight little nose a barely visible
mouth with floating vertical arms somewhat outstretched and moving
directly towards the wi this and see it was coming right for him alasco had the
strong impression that it was actually going to land right on him so he extended his arm placed his hand Palm
upwards so that this little man could land cuz that's what it looked like it was going to do but instead it stopped
only about 3 to 6 feet away from him and hovered there so elasco as you can
imagine was absolutely amazed and just stood there in an almost hypnotic TR an
watching this little figure and it just floated there looking directly at him for just a few moments and then started
moving backwards into the fog it was a very quick encounter and as his tiny
little figure disappeared into the fog the two bright lights at the gate were
extinguished they went out and elasco not hearing or seeing anything else
returned inside and at the door he met his daughter who was somewhat frantic
and said that she had been yelling at him at least two or three times fearing for his safety weirdly he never heard
her shouts which seems impossible because she wasn't that far away so this
is that weird unnatural silence this Oz Factor that's definitely prominent in
this case she did not see the little figure now later speaking with
researcher Louie Bergos elasco said that in fact several times earlier he had had
in fact seen mysterious multicolored lights which would come in and out of
the nearby River incomplete silence but following this encounter with this
strange little floating man he never saw any of these weird colored lights coming
in and out of the river nor did he have any other encounter with this tiny little floating humanoid really have to
wonder what's going on in cases like these you know why did this UFO approach this home why did this little guy get
out and float up right up to this witness kind of just look at him and then turns around floats back and goes
into his presumed craft and off it goes there was no onboard experience there
was no real communication suppose it could be another of what UFO researchers call a
display just a way to announce their presence but it was pretty clear to me
that the witness was targeted was that this event was
intentional uh because there's just no getting around that the fact that he was
within four or five feet of this apparent extraterrestrial tiny little
guy so weird I mean it's just so strange now let's move to another case I
call this one memories of graay this took place mostly in 2001 and
thereabouts in Norfolk Virginia I did interview the witness directly he does
not want his real name used I call him Alex and his case does appear in my book
humanoids and high strangeness so I'm not going to cover all the details because it's a fairly extensive series
of events but I think it's an important case with some real interesting insights
into how people communicate with ETS so I think you'll find it interesting it was 2001 and Alex was about 5 years old
when suddenly he sat up in bed to notice that the whole room was glowing with
this pale blue light and opening his eyes he got an incredible shock he saw
that there were short figures standing around his brother's bed I'll call his
brother Craig that's not his real name but Craig was one year older than Alex
now Craig was asleep he had no idea that there were figures in his room
surrounding his bed but as Alex says it looked like you put a blue filter over
my room it was like a kind of grayish blue kind of brightness it didn't seem to be emanating from anywhere in
particular and I remember seeing Grays in my room small gray figures I saw them
around my brother's bed I remember seeing their heads from behind very large heads with gray
Skin So Alex counted at least three or four of them he didn't see how they arrived he doesn't remember them leaving
the next thing he knows Morning Has Come he says this happened a few times around that age and these memories kind of came
back to him slowly and at first were somewhat unclear Z says I just have
vague memories of Grays in my bedroom surrounding my bed as well as my brother's bed pretty much all I remember
is my room glowing blue and these Grays standing around mine in my brother's bed so following this all kinds of weird
events happened Alex started to suffer from chronic insomnia something that still bothers him he started to have
unexplained nose bleeds though he didn't remember this at the time and he didn't connect any of this to these nighttime
visitations with Grays in fact the last thing he wanted to do was think about all of this so he kind of just shoved it
all out of his mind but it wasn't long after this that he began to have premonitions Deja Vu telepathy hearing
what people were thinking all kinds of paranormal phenomena but he was quite
young wasn't sure how to interpret them didn't really think that they were unusual he does report feeling like he
was being watched or observed he started having very vivid dreams of apocalyptic
scenarios Wars cataclysms earthquakes tsunamis famines and more and he also
discovered that he had this amazing artistic ability and he began to draw very detailed illustrations now Alex's
parents were very religious attended church regular ly and when memories of the gravs began to surface he decided to
get some advice from the people at church and when he tried to talk about it he said he became quote overcome with
a crippling fear and began to shake uncontrollably he says this happens
every time as he says when I start to talk about it I just start shaking
uncontrollably I don't know it's like fear striking it's really scary it just
scared me I think it just scared me so badly that I don't remember a lot and when I start to talk about it I start to
feel that fear although he was remembering this it was very difficult for him he did get a computer around age
12 this changed his life CU now he started researching these subjects ETS
psychic phenomena conspiracies secret societies ancient civilizations the
Illuminati astral projection psychic phenomena all of this interested him very much in fact he started meditating
regularly and this ramped up his psychic abilities he remembers sitting in class
one day bored and tired decided to conduct a psychic experiment with his friend who sat directly in front of him
he laid his head down on his desk and sent a telepathic message to his friend to turn around and tap him on the
shoulder three times as Alex says I thought if I can prove this to myself
then I would know for sure that I was not crazy and sure enough he did it I
told him what I had done right after he did it and as soon as he did that I was like crapping my pants I was like oh my
God this is crazy so he and I went back and forth mentally telling each other to do things like hold up two fingers or
tap me on the shoulder this number of times and stuff like that it was just insane we got to where we could send
these completely random messages multiple times so this is when something
very unusual happened to Alex he learned about the subject of channeling reaching
out mentally and communicating telepathically with entities so he tried
to do this he meditated and telepathically reached out and started
to get instant contact with some that felt like spirits but others he says
felt absolutely not human he said this scared the crap out of him he's like
this is not me talking so this really overwhelmed him and he kind of shut it down a little bit
and in fact he was going through a lot of stress at this time and started using over-the-counter prescription drugs and
got a little bit addicted to them but continued to experiment with meditation and channeling and it was during this
time that he says he mentally made a connection with what he believes is one of the great aliens who is visiting him
as a child and as he says I know the drug use will call into question the
validity of my following statements but during this time I felt I was in contact with an ET that I could speak with
telepathically so having had some telepathic communication with Spirits
this felt entirely different he said that this entity felt less emotional
more scientific and was very wise very Advanced and Incredibly powerful and it
began to share spiritual information with him very helpful information as
Alex says when it does make contact with me or I have contact with it it just
kind of happens the energy you get from this kind of entity feels way different from anything else it's like an
incredibly intelligent but oddly neutral feeling just incredibly strong I was
being spoken to about things that have to do with spiritual awareness and stuff like that
so this changed Alex's life he stopped doing prescription drugs got his life on
track as he started to grow up he got a good job moved out of his house found a
girlfriend and it was then that he found the strength and courage to begin exploring his weird childhood
experiences it was in 2016 at around age 19 that he did have his first UFO
sighting of a star-like object which he says quote moved IR radically at right
angle and high speeds so it was a distant and brief sighting but it was definitely a UFO and he feels connected
to his experiences so this got him thinking about his encounters as a young kid he
did ask his older brother Craig if he remembered anything Craig said no he did
not remember seeing any Grays but he did remember something as Alex says he said
he remembers a scary shadow man living in the closet when I was a newborn he
does remember seeing some kind of strange looking figure in his closet so this encouraged Alex and he
approached his parents and asked them about uh if they knew anything unusual
going on he shared his memories of seeing Grace and their response was
really shocking to him and confirming as Alex says they said that I would wake
them up in the middle of the night pretty frequently telling them that they the aliens were trying to take me away
and that I would have these nose beds I don't remember getting them chronically as a kid but according to my parents
this used to happen a lot they both think that I was contacted at some point in my childhood so this was really
beginning to consume a lot of Alex's attention and he finally joined an internet UFO group and began talking
about this entity that he had telepathically contacted during High School because he was nervous about it
and wondering you know is this a friendly entity or is it not and he said this caused an immediate
reaction because as Alex says that night I was bombarded with messages from this
entity for the first time in years I couldn't close my eyes or sleep without
seeing or hearing this entity he was displeased with the negative way I had
portrayed him to the people I had spoken to and said something to the effect of I
was looking out for you so this entity was quite concerned that Alex was afraid
and portraying him in a malicious way and told him that he was the one who was
trying to help him when nobody else was which was absolutely true because at
that time Alex had a lot of people around him who were enabling him to do drugs and did not have his best
interests in mind and this entity who had contacted him was trying to help him and guide him and get him away from this
but this was all quite difficult for Alex to process because as he says I was
doubting if this was just me or was I just imagining stuff but in my mind I could see his face he looked like a gray
but from what I understand he's not exactly a physical entity he's also
interdimensional he has a physical aspect and he has a non-physical aspect too that's how he the capabilities to
speak telepathically but is able to physically intervene with me in the physical
world so Alex continued to have contact and still to this day in fact in April
2022 Alex was receiving indications that he was still in contact with these grades from his childhood as he says it
was 3:00 a.m. in the morning I woke up and there were these flashes coming into my house through the window and it was
really really bright I still don't know what it was me and my fiance were just
joking it's aliens so although they were joking about it Alex takes it seriously
because it kept happening he says I keep hearing this strange humming noise at
night sometimes and I feel like I'm being watched and every time the cat acts weird I feel like they want to show
themselves to me but know that I would freak out and panic because I really would the thing is I just have a really
deeply driven carnal fear of being abducted so even though I know that typically it's not a malicious event I
still can help be terrified because it's been like that my whole life anytime I
try to talk to anybody about it I just shake uncontrollably but honestly if it were
up to me I would dive head first into it and get over this fear and go as far as
I can so this is when Alex contacted me he says I helped him immensely he was
incredibly great f as was I to speak with him cuz his story is super
interesting and he really progressed in overcoming his fear and even went so far
as to investigate C5 groups to see if he could go out and make contact
intentionally unfortunately his work schedule and distance have not made this really feasible but again his story is
told in my book humanoids and high strangeness and there's quite a bit more to it it's a real privilege to interview
this gentleman Alex uh he was very appreciative to have someone listen to
his story my heart really goes out to him because he still does have some fear surrounding his encounters even though
he's absolutely convinced they are benevolent and I find it fascinating because he communicated extensively
telepathically with his ET and it totally changed his life he's profoundly
psychic and he's got this really deep interest in all these really unusual subjects he's a very accomplished artist
these are patterns we see with a lot of contes so yeah a real fascinating case
and again if you want to check out more about it please do look at my book humanoids and high
strangeness because I there's a lot of cases in there and in that book I really
do try to embrace the full range of what goes on when someone has contact there
is a paranormal connection there is a spiritual aspect to all of this and a lot of this is being censored out
frankly of other cases I know this to be true so I really wanted to bring all of
the information in that goes on when someone is having direct contact so now let's move to the next
case which I call stay calm it's all right and that is a direct quote from
the ET to the witness this is a pattern we see in a lot of cases it's kind of why I wanted to include this
case uh this one took place in Vancouver Canada in February of
2015 and there's some very unusual aspects to it I mean you'll see once we
get to the description of the ET and how the witness reacted to her encounter
this next case is quite brief but super interesting and it comes from Canadian researcher and author Nathaniel brisland
And It's featured in his book crawler a conclusive case book The Witness I'll
call her Ellie that's not her real name she's Anonymous but it was early on the evening of February 15 2015 Ellie was
taking a nap while her boyfriend went out to get some food this is about 700 p.m. she woke up to hear the familiar
sound of him walking up the stairs but of course as it turned out it wasn't him
at all it sounded like him but it wasn't now Ellie was a bit groggy as she got out of bed in fact she knocked over a
can on her bed table as she got out of bed and went to open the glass doors
leading to the stairs from her bedroom and as she did so this is when she got an incredible shock because there was a
very tall figure standing in front of her in fact it was so tall that she had
to Crane her neck upwards to see it so she estimates it was 8 ft tall possibly
as tall as 9 ft she said had a very skinny body pale white beige skin
incredibly long arms and fingers she didn't see any mouth she did see that it
had a large oval bald head huge dark eyes and it seemed to be almost glowing
with white yellow light which was bright enough to illuminate the hallway where it was standing and she said it was strange cuz
it was holding out its arms towards her as if asking for a hug almost now she
was initially shocked and really shocked because this wasn't her boyfriend and
seeing its long arms and fingers and its inhuman appearance fear did overwhelm
her she was afraid it was going to reach out and touch her but very quickly her response to this softened and she was
amazed to find that she wasn't scared at all instead she began to feel very strong feelings of calmness and
tranquility and even felt caring and love coming from this being she found
herself returning calmly back to her bed say it it was almost as if it sensed her
fear and was stretching out its arms in a caring way saying stay calm behave
it's all right she had the sense that this being was incredibly powerful very
wise and in fact standing next to it she almost felt like a young child while in its presence she felt like she had to be
respectful to it so she was very groggy almost drugged she says as she crawled
back into bed and glancing back back at the doorway she saw that it had
disappeared I suspect there's a lot more to that case that has yet to be revealed
because when someone has an ET coming into their house directly this usually
means that there's a lot more going on that there are repeated incidents
although the witness doesn't talk about that or it's certainly not presented in the book on this case I suspect it's
true that she's probably a contacte but it's certainly a very interesting casee
and I thought it was super interesting how she felt great love from this being and gentleness and caring because this
is a pattern we do see in a lot of cases despite the fact that there is a lot of fear surrounding this
subject so now let's move to the last and final case probably the most unusual
one I can't say I've ever heard of a case like this I was quite interested to
investigate this one because the witness is very sincere he's gone public with
his case he's spoken about it many times I call this one the tale of an alien
with a tail Yes you heard me right you'll see how unusual this case is once
we get into it but it occurred one day in May of 2016 this is a daylight case
in county armag in Northern Ireland I like this case because this witness is
not only very sincere but had a very very close
up uh observation of a really really unusual looking humanoid like a gray in
most respects but as we'll see some unusual details that I've never heard before the witness to this very unusual
case is Aran Jones a musician you can see him here he reported to the north
Ireland UFO societ society and what a crazy experience this one is one day in
May of 2016 Aran was driving down tanaki Road
on his way to the Village of Pony's pass this is in County armag Northern Ireland
said it was a beautiful sunny day but coming around a corner on this little Country Road he saw something that gave
him one of the biggest shocks of his life I'll just quote Aran extens ly
because he describes his encounter very vividly and an incredible detail as Arin
says it was totally unexpected I just came around the corner and there it was
standing in the middle of the road with its back towards me kind of turning kind of walking way up a bit in front of me a
two-legged thing standing there like a person but it wasn't a person this thing
it was scary the body has got like muscles to it totally around it flat
like a pod the arms were very thin but muscly it was I'd say 6 feet very tall
the legs were really muscular and it had a tail I can describe the tail to you it
was a bit like a rat's tail it had ridges and the tail flipped around
that's what shocked me the whole thing shocked me but actually seeing the tail
the only thing I could do at that time was to look it up and down about five or six times from head to toe and I took it
all in the color of it it was blue gray very dark blue it stood tall like a
person stance a very tall thing it looked like a gray like an ET as I was
coming up to it it turned I was getting closer to it and I didn't know what to do I was shaking my whole body was
trembling my heart was just racing I thought I'm not going to see my kids
again I'm not going to see anybody there's that fear as I came up to it I
put the brakes on there's nothing much I could do there just slow down but as I
came up towards it it turned around slowly and believe it or not it stood
proud it wore no clothes it was a creature it wasn't human it frightened
me it stood straight up in front of me its arms down at its sides and then as I
came that close really close to it it leaned to its side looked at me straight through the
windshield of the car I looked into its eyes and I could see every single line
on its forehead every line on its face and I looked directly into its black
eyes so Aran was too afraid to run over this thing with his car he didn't know
what it was he didn't know how dangerous it might be he didn't know what would happen if he attempted to do something
like that and most mostly he was just shocked especially by this weird tail which he could see flexing there was no
way he said that this could have been a normal person in a costume because the hips were way too narrow it had a very
unusual muscular structure that he could clearly see uh he said his eyes were
looking straight at him and as it did so it kind of wrinkled its forehead and after gazing directly at Aran and he's
looking back at it it reached out with its left hand and pulled the Hedge and
grasses aside turned looked at him one more time and then went through the
Hedge and into the field darting at super high speed much faster than any
normal creature could do needless to say this absolutely freaked Aran out as he
says I didn't stop I just put my foot on the accelerator and just drove down the
road I was shaking like a leaf I just went down the road in the back of my
mind I was thinking I hope it doesn't come after me so he raced away from the scene
completely shocked he couldn't get it out of his mind as you can imagine and he knew he had to tell somebody he
immediately told his family his parents uh and they absolutely believed
him he decided to send off an email to a government department but never heard back from them no surprise there but
finally still unable to get this account out of his mind he found a UFO group and
reported his encounter and this led to it being fully investigated which turned out some
interesting information cuz he learned that someone else had actually seen a
dis shaped craft in the field directly across from where he had seen this
strange being in May 2016 the witness who saw this dis shaped
craft saw it as well in May 2016 and as you can see here it was actually able to
capture a really good photograph of it so that's incredible confirmation and following this
encounter Aran believes that he may have had further contact because not long
after this he woke up one morning to find strange yellow marks bruises kind of like finger marks on his arms a
little puncture Mark he says he's not sure if he was taken he's not really
willing to admit that but as he says quote something happened
and all of this absolutely brought up other events that occurred in his
childhood that he had never been able to explain because he does remember that years earlier when he was just a young
kid his mother was driving and he was in the back of the car with his other siblings when his mother suddenly
shouted out what was that and explained that she had seen an unusual white figure Dart across the road he of course
later asked her about it and she confirmed it but didn't really want to talk talk about it but Aran recalled
many other unusual experiences as a young child including seeing a full
color Apparition of a young woman in the kitchen of their home and he says that following this encounter he has seen
UFOs on a few occasions glowing objects in the sky somewhat distant but one time
one of these objects was darting around and clearly unconventional movements and
another time he saw this star-like object and and as he was watching it it darted straight up at very high speed
and he was not alone during these sightings so he had other Witnesses but it was this encounter with
this very unusual humanoid that completely changed his life it led to
him going public speaking about it on several podcasts so he's been very
straightforward about what he's seen he's very sincere about it and ultimately he says it was not a negative
encounter uh he said the being actually was not scary to look at it was just
shocking but as he says and I quote it was not of this world it was a bit like
winning the lottery it's changed my life in such an amazing way it will stay with
me forever one of the lasting effects of this incident was that Aran now
installed a dash cam on his car just in case something like this happens again
there you go I mean that case is undeniably very unusual if not unique
but hearing from the witness firsthand going over his case seeing all the evidence surrounding it and he does have
corroborating witnesses to some extent perhaps not of the humanoid he saw but of the other events that have been
occurring in his life that are also unusual he's not the only witness to a lot of these and you can tell how
profoundly it affected him he's a very clearly sincere witness so a real
compelling case and like I've always said I think each case adds to our knowledge of what's
going on here these 10 cases should only be considered the tiniest tiniest
sampling of what's really going on covered well over a thousand humanoid
cases on this channel alone closer to 2,000 not more than that and again most
people who have these encounters don't talk about them so any estimates as to how common this is is probably far too
low it's not nearly as uncommon as people think the evidence is undeniable
we've got photographs and Landing traces and physiological effects and animals reacting and electromagnetic
disturbances and I mean it just goes on and on the evidence is there to deny it
or ignore it or try to explain it away is no longer tenable we are being
visited it's that simple it's why I do this research people deserve to know the truth about it it's a really important
subject a new era is Dawning for all Humanity I think as this subject is now
going mainstream and I'm pretty excited about it not sure our governments or
intelligence agencies or the highest levels of the military or who's ever behind this coverup are ever going to be
voluntarily fully truthful and transparent with this subject I think we have a long road ahead of us before we
see the craft and the bodies that are being held in military custody but on
the other hand I think at some point it has to happen guess we'll see but thank you again for watching I truly
