ENCOUNTER ON A DESERT HIGHWAY
Aug 22, 2025

Summary:
Aug 22, 2025 (1:40:01)
On the evening of September 14, 1978, Susan Ware (an artist and former 3rd Class Petty Officer in the US Navy) and her friend Karen drove along a remote highway in the deserts of central Utah. It was a beautiful night as the moon rose, and the stars shone brightly in the clear night sky. But suddenly, things changed. An eerie darkness settled over the area, blotting out their view of the sky above. Then, without warning, Karen, (who was driving) slammed on the brakes and came to a stop. Ahead of them on the highway, they saw something astonishing. A group of twenty oversized jackrabbits were blocking the road. The rabbits stood unmoving, like sentries, their backs facing the vehicle. The astonished women exited the car and stared with disbelief. The jackrabbits were far too large to be normal, and their lack of movement betrayed the fact that something very odd was happening here.

Susan and Karen walked to the front of the car and reached out to hold each other’s hand. At that moment, the lights in the vehicle turned off, the radio which had been playing became silent, a blinding light shone down on them from above, and all the rabbits turned around in one smooth, synchronized movement. Susan screamed. The rabbits were no longer rabbits: they were gray aliens!

The next thing Susan and Karen knew, it was morning, nine hours had passed, and they were in a small diner in Grand Junction, Colorado, hundreds of miles away from their original location. Both women stared around them in astonishment. Susan’s mind instantly went back to the last thing she remembered: the car stopping, the rabbits turning around, the gray aliens, the bright light coming from above. At the same time, she began having flashbacks of being in a strange room, seeing gray ETs looking at her, and falling through the sky high above the Earth. Karen, however, could only remember starting the drive earlier that evening. She didn’t remember anything about the encounter itself. Both women had no idea how they got to the diner. And both felt physically ill with burns on their skin, a raging thirst, nausea and more.

Unable to understand and process the experience, both women moved on with their lives. As Susan recovered, she remembered that as a child, she had several encounters with strange humanoids looking in through the window of her home. Joining the Navy as a young woman, she had several UFO sightings. Once while camping with friends in the desert, she had an astonishing close-up sighting.

For decades, she did her best to forget about her strange experiences, particularly the encounter on the desert highway. She got married, had children and did her best to live a normal life. But throughout the years, she continued to have experiences with high strangeness: seeing a spirit, having psychic visions, powerful intuitions and synchronicities, remote viewing, even a couple of Bigfoot encounters. But always, in the back of her mind, was the encounter on the desert highway. What happened that night? What had occurred during those nine hours of missing time?

Finally, the time came when Susan realized it was time to figure things out. Her children had grown up. She was separated from her husband. She no longer had to worry about what other people might think. She went to her computer and typed in the word UFO. To her amazement, the film, “Alien Abduction Answers,” by John Yost had just been released that very day. This incredible synchronicity inspired her to reach out to John Yost. This led to her meeting hypnotherapist Debz Shakti.

Under hypnosis, Susan recalled being pulled onboard a craft along with her friend Karen. She found herself in a small room with soft blue walls. A small gray stood next to her. Susan asked if she could touch the being, and it said yes. It then proceeded to show her images of war: tanks on the streets, explosions, people starving and more. The gray warned her that Susan had to do her best to warn the world about the dangers of human aggression. She was physically examined, and she believes she may have been healed. Both women were returned to Earth.

Going under hypnosis turned out to be a turning point in Susan’s life. She overcame the fear of her encounter and finally had answers about what happened. She sought the help of researchers like Richard Banasiak and Earl Grey of MUFON. Susan’s case garnered a lot of attention and was voted as MUFON’s best case of the year for 2023.

Susan’s story is also told in my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
I have a great episode for you today. I call this one encounter on a desert highway. This is all about the UFO
experiences of Susan Wear. She's had a lifetime of encounters, but there was an
encounter in 1978 while driving through the deserts of central Utah that really
changed her life. This has become a very well-known case and in fact it became
the case of the year of 2023 for the Mutual UFO network. Susan has worked
with a lot of different researchers and people to investigate her case and uncover what happened including of
course myself. She reached out to me after hearing about my research, but she also worked directly with MUON field
investigator Richard Banisk and with Earl Gray. She worked with John Yoast, a
documentarian and an experiencer responsible for the book Alien Abduction
Answers. She worked with the amazing Debs Shakti, a hypnotherapist who really
helped her to remember what happened to her during this missing time encounter
on a desert highway. So, it's a truly incredible series of events starting
really all the way in early childhood up to pretty much the present day. Susan's
case is covered in my book, Humanoids and High Stranges: 20 True UFO
Encounters, and that tells the whole story. She's also the subject of a
documentary film by Steve Neil called The Jack Rabbit Abduction. I'll have the
link to that film in the show notes, so you can definitely check that out. but
she's been on a number of podcasts including the Lightgate which I co-host with Dolly Saffron but also Spaced Out
Radio with Dave Scott UAP podcast a number of other different podcasts. So
she's definitely getting the word out about her encounters. But this in this
particular episode we're going to hear her whole story from beginning to end.
And actually, I'm not going to start with her early childhood. I'm going to start actually when Susan was 18 years
old in 1974. She was living in North Carolina and she
decided that she was going to join the Navy. So Susan did her boot camp in
Orlando, Florida. And following this, she was stationed at Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Virginia. But she really
wanted to travel beyond the East Coast. So, she requested a transfer and she hit
the lottery. To her delight, she was transferred to Barber's Point Naval Air Station in Oahu, Hawaii.
By the way, this area does have a long history of UFO encounters. Now, Susan was a bit of a pioneer. She was assigned
to a squadron of 400 men and she was only one of three women in the squadron
and she was actually the first woman on the flight line in the C130 and C18
aircraft squadron. Her job involved checking the planes over the batteries,
the fuel, the anti- ice fluids, making sure everything was cleaned up and ready to go right back out after coming in.
So, she enjoyed this. It was satisfying work. She learned a lot and a few times she did get to fly and a few times she
noticed strange anomalies in the sky, orange globeike objects. She was unsure
if these were military or not, but they didn't seem to be military because
nobody was talking about it. And one time after seeing these things, she made the mistake of pointing one of them out
to her superior and asking what it was. He was angry. He put his finger in her
face and said, "If you want to be the first one transferred out of here, say another word about it." And this was not
the only time this sort of thing happened. On another occasion, she was on the line waiting for a plane to come
in and saw strange lights over the water. She later asked a bowling buddy
about it, and he gave her this warning look, which clearly said, "We don't talk about things like that." So, of course,
she didn't. She did see another UFO once while flying in a C130. And another time
she was flying in a C118 and saw a quote big white silver ball which appeared to
be pacing the plane. And before she could stop herself, she found herself asking, "What the heck is that?" Once
again, her superior was not happy, put his finger in her face again, and said,
"You don't talk about that. You don't talk about it to me. You don't talk about that to anybody else unless you're
planning your ticket out of here. So once again, she kept that to herself. It
always felt like a secret that was never explained. And she had no idea that one day she would see and experience these
things firsthand and she would talk about it. You know, I saw a couple of things when
we flew and I remember the first time seeing something out the window and saying, "What's that?" And you know,
everybody came over the window and looked out, but
soon as I said, "What is it?" And it's like, "Oh, we don't talk about that. We don't talk about that at all. You don't
don't talk to anybody about that." And I finger finger in the face. It was
a orange ball. Uhhuh. One time it was a dark gray ball and one
time it was a orange ball. Uh, one time it was between Hawaii and Kawaii and the
other time I think we were just out uh testing an
engine, so we weren't very far. But, um, I even asked somebody one time
at the bowling alley and they were like, you know, we don't talk about that. And I thought, what is the deal? It has to
be something if nobody's talking about it. Were you thinking
I mean it was seen and only flown a few times. How could they not see it
all the time? Because they flew all over the Pacific.
So, you know, I was the first girl and I was on the flight line and I just learned real quick to keep my mouth
shut. Truly astonishing. She had several UFO sightings while in the Navy. And I think
probably that's a lot more common than we hear about here in the civilian sector because most people don't talk
about it. As we've seen, they're instructed not to. So, kudos to Susan for having the courage to come forth and
share that she actually did see UFOs while in the Navy. And of course, that
wasn't the end of her encounters. Susan did really well in the Navy. She
excelled. She made a lot of friends. She learned a lot. She actually moved up in rank to third class petty officer. But
ultimately she was transferred to NAS Naval Air Station on the North Island of
San Diego. This is in 1977. This was great because it allowed her
more free time. She had her weekends free, so she could explore the beaches
and the forests and the deserts. of Southern California. She had a lot more free time. She had a lot of good friends
and it was then that she started to have some more really unusual experiences. In
fact, in 1978, she and a group of friends took a crosscountry
camping trip, an off-road trip into the Anza Burggo Desert of Southern
California. And it was there she had a UFO encounter and an amazing incident
involving a missing shoe. And this was a mystery that would take years to solve.
So this next experience was in early 1978. She and her friends were camping out in
the wilds of the Anza Berago Desert in Southern California. They had enjoyed
the evening and had all gone to bed. It was very early in the morning, about 300 a.m. Susan estimates. Everyone was quiet
and she woke up startled and noticed something bright moving in the sky overhead. The sky was full of stars.
There was a new moon, so it was very noticeable. And she sat up and saw this blue green sort of egg-shaped object
moving slowly and silently. and it approached to less than a thousand feet, she estimates, but was still kind of on
the other side of the cliffs surrounding them. And she watched in total disbelief
as this object shot out smaller sort of blue green glowing spheres, which
appeared to descend to the desert floor. Now, they were in a kind of a ravine, so
her view was limited, but she was amazed at how beautiful the color of these things were, and she wondered what she
was looking at. Could it be some kind of military training? Some sort of new flare? Whatever this egg-shaped object
was, it wasn't making any sound. And these objects going to the ground weren't making any sound either. So,
after watching these little orbs shoot out, this craft slowly floated to the east and Susan went back to sleep. Now,
when she awoke, she started to get dressed and this is when she noticed one of her shoes was missing.
Now, she did have it before she went to sleep, and now it was nowhere to be
found. So, she asked the guys, "Who took my shoe?" And they just kind of looked
at her dumbly and said, "What are you talking about?" They thought she was joking. And they laughed. But no, she
was serious. And they all denied stealing her shoe. Why would they do that? So, everyone gathered together and
they searched the whole camp. But her shoe was nowhere to be found. So, she
did approach her best friend there, a gentleman by the name of Rick, and shared her UFO sighting that night, but
he kind of just shrugged and said he didn't see anything. And apparently, nobody else had. So, everyone just kind
of laughed about this missing shoe except Susan. She didn't think it was particularly funny. They packed up the
campsite and prepared to drive out. They were again off-roading. So they were
driving along in this little convoy of jeeps. They had gone about a mile when
the lead jeep stopped. One of the men got out and pointed up to the top of a sheer cliff and said, "Do you see what I
see?" So Susan and everyone else peered up and stared in shock. And as Susan
says, it was my shoe and it was up on the very top of a pointed sheer cliff.
There was no reason my shoe would have been up there. So, everyone began laughing. They were absolutely in shock.
They were saying, "How did it get up there? That's hilarious. What did you do? How did it get there?" Susan, of
course, denied going up there. There was no way. This was a mile away. There was no reasonable explanation.
So, two of the guys climbed up there. It was quite difficult. They retrieved it. They couldn't see any footprints around
it. It looked as if it had been dropped from the sky. So this was a mystery that
it looked like it would never be solved. But years later, the answer would come in a very unexpected way. So Susan had
her shoe back. They continued their way out of the desert and came upon another puzzling mystery. They were driving up
and came upon a tumble of boulders that were blocking their passage. So using
pulleys and other jeeps, they were able to make it over the boulders only to discover something that seemed
impossible. that lying in the center of this ring of boulders was an old green Buick Electra with a black top. A car
was weathered, rusted. It had clearly been there a long time. But there was
just no way that this thing could have gotten there by itself. It was flatly impossible. It was far too large to have
gotten over the boulders that were surrounding it. As Susan says, there is
no way it could have gotten there other than if it was dropped from above. And that's exactly what she told everyone
there. They all laughed, but they were all incredibly puzzled. They spent some
time there examining this car, trying to figure it out. There were no license plates. It was empty of all belongings.
So, ultimately, it was just a weird mystery. One other thing that stood out on that Anza Barago trip were these big
jack rabbits that Susan kept watching crossing the highway on the way to the desert. She never forgot those. Even
though she only caught brief glimpses of them, she really wanted to see them again. And later she would, but not in
the way she expected. It was kind of odd because I remember waking up and there was a an eggshaped.
Now remember, we were in the ravine and so the you know the the peaks were all around us on both sides, but there was a
X-shaped uh blue kind of turquoisey blue thing that flew over. Total silence. You
could hear the coyotes. You could hear the sounds of the desert. You could hear the fire crackling.
These little dots. Yeah, that's it. In the ravine where we were. So you could see it. You could see
them shooting out, but you couldn't I kept waiting for a sound when it hit the
ground. An explosion, a pop, anything. Nothing.
There was It was just total silence. And um I was in the green jeep sleeping
when I saw that. And I saw the guys all laying around. You could see on the on the picture laying around the fires. And
it it's really funny. I remember uh we needed more than one fire because there was some weird sounds out there. It's
the Anza Brago and it's Coyote Canyon and we had gone past the third
uh watering hole way out into the Badlands. It was just wild out there.
So, I didn't much think anything about it until the next morning
when I couldn't find my shoe. We looked everywhere. They all teased me, you know. I'm like, "You guys, somebody had
to take my shoe." Cuz I had both shoes when I got in here. You can't be in the desert without something covering your
foot. And we had been out all day. And I had gotten in there and then taken my shoes off and gone to sleep. So, um, the
next day, just out of the blue, we they were all joking because I was, you know, saying,
you know, you guys, I want my shoe. And we got everything loaded up and kept
going forward. We didn't backtrack. We went forward deeper. And
about a mile away, they found my shoe. They just stopped.
What is that? And why is your shoe up there? It was a mile away. Nobody had
left camp. Nobody had taken my shoe over there. It was bizarre. I could not figure it out. It's always been on my
mind since 1970. This was probably 70, early 78.
and in my first trip out there. So, the guys climbed up and got the shoe
and you know, we did the whole investigation. There were no walking marks. There were no cave-ins around the
shoe. There was nothing. It was just sitting on a sheer cliff by itself, just sitting there.
Susan's unexplained experiences were really just beginning. And in fact, she would soon have one of the biggest of
her entire life. In 1978, for a number of reasons, she decided to leave the
Navy. She did really enjoy it there. It was very hard work. She learned a lot, but it just wasn't her life path. She
really wanted to go visit her family back on the East Coast. So, she decided
that she was going to take a cross-country trip. She asked her friend Karen if she would like to join her. And
they were planning to just take their time, visit various national parks,
visit friends that they knew across the United States, and just have a good time
sightseeing and seeing all the country across the United States. And then it
turned out that one of the officers in her squadron also had family in North
Carolina. He had just bought a brand new Volvo and he wanted to get it
transferred to the East Coast and he offered to pay Susan $1,500 if she would
drive his car across the United States. So, this was perfect. Brand new car,
some spending money. Susan, of course, took the offer and she set off with
Karen across the United States and what would be actually one of the most
unusual experiences of both of their lives. It would change their lives forever. Susan and Karen were very
excited about their trip across the United States. They left California and headed to Arizona. They spent some time
visiting the Grand Canyon and then headed north to Cedar City, Utah. So
they planned to drive through the night until they reached Grand Junction, Colorado. This is a distance of just
under 400 miles. This would be a long night, but both of them felt up to it
with a long two-lane highway through the desert, and they knew it would be beautiful in this silvery moonlight. And
as Susan says, Karen was driving that night after we gassed up. We were
listening to music and I was telling her a few stories about four-wheeling in the desert in those big old jack rabbits
that were darting across the road just a few months ago in Beriggo Springs. So,
it was about 9:30 p.m. as the moon began to peek over the tops of the mountains to their right, and it was just
beginning to light up the desert floor through the passes and on the highway. The sky was crowded with stars. The
traffic was almost non-existent as they passed by the small town of Enoch. You
can see the route here. And it was shortly after passing Enoch that Susan
began to notice something strange. They had driven some miles on this road
when suddenly the moon had grown dark and there was no longer any brightness
shining on the desert floor. And she looked up and she couldn't even see any stars. So she turned to Karen again who
was driving and said, "Where's the moon? Where are the stars? They don't just go
out. The moon hasn't been up for more than a half an hour. Where did it go?" So Karen had no answer. They were just
listening to the radio. Steely Dan, Dr. Woo was blaring loudly into the night.
Their windows were open to enjoy the warm night air, but this weird unnatural
darkness seemed to settle over the landscape and around them, and everything was just eerily dark. So, she
asked Karen again, "Where did the moon go?" And Karen said it was right there.
So, Susan's looking around and not seeing it and says, "The moon's not there. Where did it go?" And she
couldn't see stars either. So, this was really freaking them out. Karen slowed
the car down and she began looking back and forth up through the windshield. Susan reclined her seat back, was
checking both sides of the road and behind them and said, "I can't find the moon. There's no stars either." So, this
is when they started to feel some a little bit of fear because they could not explain this. They were studying the
landscape around them. It was as if they were driving through pure blackness. Really, the only thing visible was their
headlights and the road ahead of them. And as Susan says, I stuck my head out
the window like a dog would. And I looked in every direction and the moon was gone. So there was no traffic. It
was really silent out. All they could hear was the music and the humming of their car. So they decided they would
pull over at the next rest stop and check out what was happening. And then
without warning, Karen slammed on the brakes and stopped cold in the middle of the highway. And both women stared in
front of them on the highway trying to make sense of what they were looking at. And Susan actually let out a small
scream because as Susan says, it felt like time stood still. In front of us
were about 20 big jack rabbits scattered on the road. They were huge, three feet
tall. They had huge rabbit ears and they weren't really moving and they were all
facing away from us. So, while they looked like jack rabbits, it was obvious to both of them that there was something
not right about them. They were far too large. They looked almost muscular. They
were all standing perfectly still. There were far too many of them. And they were just about 15 feet in front of the car,
scattered in a weirdly random pattern. So they both opened the car doors and
stepped out and took a few steps and they were standing there looking at
these jack rabbits and something seemed different to them. It's like time had
shifted. Susan said it was almost as if things were moving in slow motion.
At this point Susan screamed out, "Where are the moon? Where are the stars?
They're gone." It was at that second that the car engine stopped. The headlights went out. The song on the
radio shut off. A surreal silence enveloped them. And at that moment,
everything changed. Because, as Susan says, we stood there looking at the jack rabbits in the dark for just a split
second. And then this huge round bright white light came down from something
that was above us. It lit up the jack rabbits, us, and the car. And at the
same time, every one of those giant jack rabbits turned around in slow motion and
stared at us. Susan says they moved in unison. Immediately, she felt herself
gripped by a strange paralysis. She really wasn't sure if it was the fear or whatever it was that they were staring
at because as the jack rabbits turned around, they were not jack rabbits anymore. There was no big ears. They
were grays. They had gray skin, giant black glistening eyes, really big eyes,
so large and reflective that Susan could actually see the moon and the stars reflecting in their eyes. They were
small gray aliens. Both of them stood motionless. Neither of them could
believe what they were seeing. There was no mistaking it. As Susan says, they were gray aliens, roundheaded, gianted
beings, creatures. And with some of them, you could see the reflection of the moon and the stars in their eyes. So
at this point, they both just completely panicked. Susan began screaming. Karen
was struck dumb. Both of them seemed paralyzed. And that's all they could
remember. The next thing they knew, hours had passed. I noticed, and it's the weirdest
feeling. I can feel it in me right now. It's like, wait a minute, the moon just came up. So, where is it? And I and I
remember Karen looking up, you know, she was looking up and
it was so disturbing to me because all of a sudden it wasn't just the moon that was gone. It was the stars, too. And it
became [Music] unusually
black. But our headlights, you could focus very well um in front of us. And
then all of a sudden Karen came to a stop.
And I remember I had just said, "Oh, here's something else." About 10 minutes before that, I was telling Karen
uh stories about Rick and I and something we had seen these weird jack rabbits. And they're kind of like if
you've ever seen a um Roadrunner, when it crosses the road, it's just it's
gone. Gone. You don't see the body really, but that's what I had seen the
jack rabbits and I had told Karen about that. So when you put all this together, we're blinking our lights driving down,
you know, and I'm talking about jack rabbits. Oh, I'd love to see some of those jack rabbits. And then I told her
about it and then the blackness start. So all of a sudden the car comes to a
stop and we weren't thinking because at that point something else had started taking
over because we opened our doors and we got out and
walked around to the front of the car with the headlights on. Now remember it's pitch dark. The the stars have
disappeared and the moon had disappeared. And I remember reaching over and holding
Karen's hand for a moment. And the reason she stopped is because there were
giant jack rabbits in the road. Three just like that. Three or four feet tall
just scattered. And it was so weird because
we knew it was strange, but we weren't we weren't in our right presence. There
was just something that wasn't right. And as we look at them, all of a sudden,
there's a split second that now, oh, and the music was going really loud in the car. We were listening to Steely, Dan,
uh, Katie Lied, Dr. Woo, and it was blasting. So, all the blasting was
coming out. We got the light. That's the only reality that we have. And then all of a sudden, kaboom,
the lights went out on car stop. This music went silent and these white huge
white the whitest white I have ever seen came over us. I'm having trouble
swallowing. Came over us and it was in a circle all around the jack rabbits and us and the
car. And at that split second, the jack rabbits all turned around just like this
at the same time. They all went and looked at us and they weren't jack
rabbits. They were gray aliens. And I couldn't say that for
years. Karen finally was the first one to say, "Were they gray aliens?" And I finally were like, "Yes, I can say
it." And that was just last year. That was this the this year that I've just been able to say that. They turned
around. Their eyes were gigantic. And when I screamed, "Where is the moon and the stars?" They were in the eyes of
those aliens. The moon and the stars were in those gigantic eyes and they all
moved so weird and slow motion. Very weird.
So this was a very strange series of events. The stars and the moon disappearing, coming to a stop in the
middle of the highway and seeing all these jack rabbits. these rabbits turning around and revealing themselves
to be gray ETS seeing a light coming from above and then the next thing Susan
and Karen know they are waking up in a diner. They later find found out it's
Ry's Diner in Grand Junction, Colorado. They were sitting at a table. They were
very tired, very disoriented. There was a waitress there who shook
them awake and said, "Honey, it's time to wake up now." And they looked around
in absolute confusion because they were no longer on this desert highway in Utah. They were in this diner and it was
morning. They looked at the clock. It was 6:28 a.m. And it slowly dawned on
them that they were missing hours of time. It ended up being about 9 hours of
time. and they were over a 10020 miles away from their original location. So
this began a real journey of discovery of what happened during this missing
time. Years following this incident, Susan did some research and they now believe that the diner that they woke up
in was Ry's diner. You can see it here. The waitress told them that she actually
watched them pull up in the vville, come inside the diner, and just lay their heads on the table as if they were
exhausted. And she said they lay there for about 10 minutes when finally she walked up to them and woke them up. So
when they woke up, both Susan and Karen had a raging thirst. They were parched.
They ordered glasses of water and a couple of Dr. Peppers and tried to figure out what had just happened. They
quickly downed their drinks and asked for more. both felt really ill. They were flushed, nauseous. Their skin felt
like it was on fire. They had really dry mouths. It looked almost as if their eyebrows and hair had been singed. Both
of them were disoriented to the point that they had trouble thinking and even speaking. Neither of them had any memory
of how they had gotten there. And as Susan says, I was covered with burns. I
was nauseous. I felt sick. and blisters were starting to form on my face, neck, and stomach. So, as she sat there, Susan
immediately began having flashbacks. She of course remembered the car stopping,
the jack rabbits on the highway. She remembered getting out and screaming when these rabbits turned around to
reveal themselves as gray aliens. She remembers the light coming down from above and screaming. She also recalled
other flashes of memory. One was particularly vivid. She recalled dropping down from the sky at a very
high altitude. The wind was roaring around her. She could see the red desert
landscape below her. She also had flashbacks of being in a strange foggy room. It was very clear to her what had
happened. She had been taken on board a UFO and these were gray aliens. But the
whole idea of it was so staggering, so unbelievable, she could barely process
it. She could barely talk about it. especially because Karen didn't remember any of this. The last thing Karen
remembered was watching the sunset in Cedar City before they even began driving through the desert. So, after
sitting there in the diner for a short while, they found a cheap motel and they spent the next two days recovering.
Neither of them spoke much about what happened. They did check the car and they found that the odometer was missing
about 400 miles from their trip and the gas, too. They were making careful
notations of the gas and the miles driven. So they were absolutely certain about this. So that was weird. But they
were determined to continue their trip. So they moved on. They visited Pikes Peak in Colorado and then Lake Dylan.
They still had to deliver this car to North Carolina. And they were determined to have fun while doing it. They did
occasionally discuss what happened. They asked each other, "How the hell did this happen?" several times. like where were
we? But at the same time, they felt unable to say much more about it, especially because nine hours of time
were missing. And as Susan says, it really messes up your mind when something totally unexplained happens
and then you can't even talk about it to the one person that it happened with. Sharing something so traumatizing seemed
to block my memory. It also gave me deep fear to try and think about it too much
at any one time because I got those memory flashes that made no sense. They
were alarming in every way. I remembered those huge black eyes filled with stars
and the car turning off and the music falling silent all in the same moment. I
remember falling in my dress through space through the sky from so high up I
could see the curvature of the earth. I could clearly see the blazing bright sun beginning to rise and splash bright red
light onto the ground below me. I was falling super fast and I could hear
gusting winds and feel the searing heat as the sun came over the east to below.
I remember all the red rocks and meas and rock formations below me glowing as I got closer to Earth. I remember
falling through what I knew were layers of atmosphere. Blacks, blues, and then the earth below
me. I was afraid of hitting the ground. And then I woke up with Karen in that blasted diner at 6:28 a.m. with splotchy
burns on my body. So they continued the drive through Kansas and then Missouri, turning north in St. Louis and driving
up to some friends home in Elgen, Illinois. And slowly they began to
return to a semblance of normaly. They stayed there for a while, then went to Wisconsin where they stayed with other
friends, stayed there a little while, and then decided to just drive to Susan's family in North Carolina. It was
now September 23rd. They had been on the road for about 10 days. And during all
this time, Susan still felt the presence of the ETs around her. As she says, "I
still felt like they were kind of with me the whole trip, like watching us. I had this weird paranoia during the whole
thing. So, she stayed at her home for a few weeks, started to get really sick again. It happened very quickly. She had
an intense pain on her lower right side. She developed 103° fever pretty much
overnight, vomiting, diarrhea. Her father bought her some medicine. And Susan basically went into a deep sleep
for two days. And when she woke up, she was feeling much better. All the pain in
her side was gone. She now wonders if perhaps the ETSs came back and healed her. And she says, "Was it divine
intervention?" I'm thinking it was probably a different kind of intervention. I think it was a healing
from whatever happened, but I don't have any proof of that. We woke up in a diner in Colorado.
Just like that.
Our heads were down. My mouth's gotten real dry talking like this. This is the first time I've ever
like really said it except to car. Um, and I'm sure she probably remembers
mine cuz we said, "Where are we? What are we doing here?"
Total panic. Absolute terror. And we were covered in radiation burns.
Like blistered. Blisters had started. They weren't all blistered. Some of them
where they were just red raised splotches and um really nauseous, super dry mouth.
I felt like my sinuses, my whole body was dried up, which you know, you could
you could rationalize that as you know, we've been a desert rat for 24 hours, but that's not how there was just
something really wrong cuz we were in this diner. And the how we woke up was
the she came from behind and she said, "Honey, time to wake up now." The waitress did. And and
you know, "Where are we? Oh my god, what are we doing here?" Karen and I totally
lost. We just had a weird expression. I don't even know if I could ever even know that expression. It was like, it
was scared. It was lost. I wounded. It was like everything
all at once. And I said, "What time is it?" And she said, "6:28 a.m." And the
clock was on the wall and the sun was coming up and our car was parked in the
front of this diner out the big windows where we could see it. And I said, "How
long have we been here?" And she said, "Oh, 10 or 15 minutes. You know, can I get you anything?" And we're like, "Dr.
Pepper, you know, soda, water, everything."
And we what the problem was that we couldn't talk about it. It was so odd
looking at her, you know, two feet away
and we couldn't speak of it. There was it's like the words something stopped it
between your brain and your mouth, but the terror was in your heart. And but at
the same time that I couldn't speak, I was having this
This was the most terrorizing part. I remembered falling from the sky and I
fell for a long time and I saw the curve of the earth. I saw
the curve of the earth. That's the picture. And I saw the sun coming up and
I saw it literally coming through the the the points of the different points of the
between the mountains. The sun came in and lit up the desert, which was all red
rock. Everything in that area, Grand Junction, is all red rock.
And I saw it and it that really messed my mind up
because I could feel it. I could feel the burn. I think that's probably where I got the
radiation burns. I could feel the burning of my skin. I felt like my eyebrows had singed off and it to this
day I have like zero hair on my arms. it's never come back.
And um and I itched all over and all this was going through my head. And I
don't know what we did or I I know we went to a hotel and I know it was some gross hotel
like um cinder blocks maybe, you know, like a old hotel, but you know, this was
the 70s and it was in the highway and it was in the middle of the desert. So,
um it's not like it it was now, but it was kind of like a Route 66 hotel. We noticed
that when when we got back in the car and we were writing down the numbers, we still
had gas in the tank and we didn't have that 335 miles on the
odometer. So that tells me the car had to be taken
with us and it had to be laid down there. That's why I had asked the the
waitress, "Did you see us pull in?" And she said, "No, I just looked up and you were there."
So, it's like I still wish I would have known. And they didn't have cameras like
they do now. Or that would have been the first thing I did to see, you know, did I come out of the sky or did we drive up
or what? Cuz she did say Karen was driving. And I do have a memory before
the hypnosis of exiting the car and standing and then Karen and I looked
across the street to this giant red rock. It was a single, you know, the red
big messa um all by itself was across the street
out the the diner. We didn't know how to go back. You had to go forward because
there was no going back. going back was impossible to talk about it. And the
more we tried, the more the block came and you could feel like an oppression. I
don't know how to say it, but it could feel like the a pressure um like you were never alone like the
whole rest of the trip. But we ended up going to Pikes Peak, which you know,
14,000 ft. I remember seeing black smoke come out the back of the car. And then 2
days later, I got really sick. Like so sick that daddy was having to carry me
with projectile vomiting. And let's just say I had it from both ends. It was that bad. And my stepmother wrapped me in a
towel while daddy carried me to the bathroom because I was completely unable to walk. I was sick.
I hurt so bad on my right side. I thought I was going to die. you know, I didn't know how long I had been asleep,
but I wasn't hurting and I wasn't sick. I had um I drank a whole lot and just I
remember just laying on the sofa watching TV for about two or three days.
And um and I didn't talk about what had happened, but
I figured my daddy knew because I had told him and I remember little pieces of telling him the story. And I I I know
that he just couldn't understand because I've got the I've got the burns on me. I got the
marks on me. On my back, I have three marks that look like um
giant exploded blood vessels. One here, one here, one here. Just boom, boom,
boom. One on each side of my spine and then one shortly off to the side of my spine. and they just look like dark red
blood vessels which have been there since that day. So now that she's back in her family's
home in North Carolina, she's pretty much fully recovered, at least physically, from this incredible
encounter in Utah. Mentally, it's another thing. She was really confused
about what had happened. There wasn't a lot of people that she could talk to about this. She did try to tell her
family and while they were very supportive, they did not know what to make of it. And Susan herself became
quite obsessed with this encounter. You know, what happened and who were these
jack rabbits? You know, these were ETS. That was pretty clear to her. Karen didn't remember really any of this. So,
she was largely alone with all of this. But now, she did have the time to sort of just sit back and think about it. And
one of the things she started to think about was the fact that as a young girl, she did have some really unusual
encounters, including what appears to be an encounter with gray ETS. It was
around age 4 that Susan woke up one evening to see a stranger peering into
the window of her front door. Now, she couldn't quite remember what the face looked like, only that he looked very
different from a normal human. and it frightened her so bad that she actually climbed right over the radiator to get
back into her room, hid under the covers, peaked outside, but whatever it
was was gone. The next morning, Susan's mother noticed that her knees were a
little burned, and Susan explained that she had climbed on the radiator, but didn't say anything about the weird face
that she had seen looking at her through the window. And this same sort of event
happened at least twice more that she can remember. At age five, they moved to a new house. But these weird experiences
continued. In fact, one evening, Susan woke up to find herself outside the house with no idea how she got there. As
she says, I got outside and I had to crawl in one night. I don't remember how
I got outside. And it was around this time that Susan began having a series of
very disturbing and vivid dreams about war. As she says, "I used to have these
awful dreams and nightmares of military tanks on my street in my tiny little
neighborhood in North Carolina. Tanks on the street plowing over everybody's cars, over the trees and homes,
everything. So these nightmares puzzled her. She had no idea where they came from. She was so young. She had never
been exposed to anything like this. Yet these dreams repeated over and over
again. Kind of like a warning is how she interpreted it. And it was during this
time that Susan began to develop a very strong interest in nature. She would spend many hours out in the backyard
woods near her home. And as she says, I just remember being very in tune with
every animal in the forest. She also started having psychic experiences. She
became very intuitive and psychic. This was a talent which would definitely help her throughout her life. But other than
sometimes clashing with her mother, she had a very happy childhood. She did have some weird experiences, but she took
them in stride. She got good grades in school. She had lots of friends. And before she knew it, she was an adult.
She joined the Navy. And then, of course, she had this amazing encounter in 1978
on this desert highway in Utah. And that way I could see a straight line to where the front door is in the living room.
And and I could hear my dad come home cuz he was a cop and he'd come home about 11:00. But I guess he was already
home and I had missed it. But I heard the like the handle on the
door. And this is when we lived on the plaza in Charlotte in a in a little small house. And when I looked, there
was a weird face in those three little windows at the top of the door. There was a weird face. It was like a big head
and big eyes and weird. And I remember I needed to go to
the bathroom. So I rolled off the bed, you know, like tactical manner. And I
crawled on my hands and knees as fast as I could to the bathroom, which is a a a
central hallway, and my parents room was next door, but my brother was in the same room as I was. And I remember
hitting that heated grade on the heater in the floor, and it just like burned my
knees. But I went to the bathroom and then I was real careful,
but I I I don't know why, but I couldn't look at the the the door. It scared me so bad. I remember being in total panic
mode. And I just went back to the bed and covered up my head, you know, but
then I would see, uhoh, they're at the window. And in the summer, the window was always open because there was no AC
back then. And right, of course it wasn't as hot as it is now, but we just always had, you know, the
crickets out the out. It was just a normal that's what you did back then. Yeah. Yes. I was having recurrent dreams
that would show me tanks in the streets like military tanks
and chaos and explosions and loud
sirens and it was so chaotic in my dreams. I sometimes I couldn't stand it
and it would flash like so it wasn't a a regular dream. It was
um almost like a strobe kind of effect.
Yeah. And it it it even bothered me my whole life. I couldn't stand even as a teenager, you know, you go to parties
and they got a strobe. It's like, oh, nope. No strobe for me. Find myself sleepwalking in the yard and I don't in
in my little jammies, you know, and I couldn't get back in unless the door was
unlocked and sometimes they would leave it unlocked. Um, but I couldn't get in because it the
windows were way up off the ground. So, now we move up to the present. She's living in North Carolina following this
incredible encounter in 1978 on this desert highway in Utah, which
totally changed her life. She knew something had happened. The images of what she had experienced, the grays, you
know, seeing herself high above the earth were flashing through her mind started to cause her some anxiety. She
didn't like driving alone at night. Ultimately, she wasn't happy living on the east coast. So, she moved with her
husband. They got married uh to California. They tried to have children,
but ended up having a couple of miscarriages. So, this was very difficult for her. And
ultimately she just tried to live a normal life and shoved this experience out of her mind and move on with life.
But of course this didn't turn out quite the way she expected. You know when
contactees usually have a lifetime of unusual experiences. And certainly that was true
with Susan because one time she went out camping with her husband and a really
good friend and they started having some unusual encounters with what they
believed to be Bigfoot. One of Susan's favorite places to go camping was in
Julian in Southern California. This area is surrounded by forested wilderness and
she and her husband and her friend just loved camping at Lake Kuya Maka and with
their military training they were easily able to navigate through the wilderness which they often did. On one memorable
occasion they got to a favorite meadow which they knew pretty well and this is when the fog suddenly moved in and to
their surprise they found themselves lost and disoriented. They couldn't hear any traffic on the road. It was clear to
them that they did not know where they were. It was starting to get dark and chilly. And this is when they began to
hear this creepy sound of big branches snapping on the edge of the meadow. It
sounded to Susan like a massive creature. But they weren't able to see any animals because of the fog and the
darkness. But Susan remembers it well because she had the urge to run. But she
knew that if this was a bear, running would probably be a bad idea. and she had this weird feeling that it was
watching them and she was sort of drawn to follow the sounds of the footsteps along the edge of the meadow. As Susan
says, we kind of followed the crunching and it took us to the road. It was
almost like whatever was out there knew that we were lost and we followed it. It always kept the same distance. The next
thing we knew, we're on the road. We don't know what led us, but we were all led. Whatever it was, it was big. I
always thought it was walking on two feet versus four feet. That's why it was so creepy. I was drawn to follow it and
had not felt that feeling in those woods before. I had felt the strangeness in the desert, but never in the mountains
of Julian. This area has always been a safe zone for camping. Now, was this a
Bigfoot? It could be. I looked it up. there is a history of Bigfoot encounters in this area, but they never really
discussed it. And it was only a few weeks later while camping near this same
area at the Paso Picacho campgrounds that she and her husband and this same
friend had another experience, which made it clear certainly to Susan that
Bigfoot was in fact in this area. This was still a pretty remote area at that
time with camping spots that were widely separated and private. So they spent the
day hiking around and enjoying the serene beauty of Lake Kuya Maka and all the forests and creeks. And when night
arrived, they returned to their campsite. They set up a small dome tent, which they all shared. They got in the
tent and they were sleeping in their sleeping bags. They had a campfire which had just burned down. And at some point
during the night, they were all asleep, but Susan was awakened by movement outside the tent. At first, she wasn't
really startled, but she became aware that someone or something was walking
around her campsite. She could actually hear it fumbling around with an empty bottle. And in the next few seconds, she
became quite frightened because she went from wondering what this sound was to
seeing a big dark shadow between the flickering fire and the thin nylon tent.
So whatever was out there was just a few feet away from her. And then in a split second, looking through the thin nylon
tent fabric, Susan saw a giant arm reach over the top of the tent and actually
push down the center top directly over her. It made a squishing sound when it hit the tent. She saw an impression of a
giant hand. Without thinking what she was doing, she just reacted instinctively.
She reached up and pushed her own hand on this other hand and screamed, "Get
out!" Now, this hand was easily twice the size of her own hand. It had
fingers. She could clearly feel them through the tent. And as Susan says, it was like giving a high five to a giant
strong hand. It instantly drew back when I screamed. I heard whatever it was
leave with a few quick steps away towards the back of the tent and then head into the woods by the trail and
then silence, total silence in the woods. So Susan screamed, waking up the
other two. She told them what happened, but they accused her of dreaming the whole thing. Susan insisted that she was
awake. She also noticed this musty, swampy, kind of wet dog smell in the
campsite through the tent that had not been there before. She knew it was the smell of whatever that thing was. And
she was creeped out because she had actually almost touched this thing. She lay there awake for some time making
sure that whatever this was was not returning. She kind of knows what it was. She thinks it was a Bigfoot. But
after hearing the sounds of the forest returning, listening to the fire crackling, she went back to sleep. The
next morning, she again explained what happened. And they both told her she must have been dreaming. But as Susan
says, little did they know that a big creature on two legs, very tall and
stinky, had walked into our camp, touched the glass bottle, and made it move on the ground, which woke me up.
Then it made a giant shadow on the tent, and its giant hand had literally pushed the top of the tent down to within a
foot of my face, and I had slapped it and screamed, and it ran away. It was on
two feet. This was not a 4-footed creature. It stunk, and its steps were
gigantic, and it got away so fast. That was the weirdest thing. That was near Julian. And and and it was
so simple. I set up at night. I could see the fire flickering. Um, we had been
drinking a little bit that night and there was a bottle went clink and my husband was beside me and Jackie was
with me and I saw that monster. I saw
the hand gigantic. Um, I could hear him breathing and he
pushed the top of our tent down and it was like this close to my head and I
scream, "Get out!" And I remember it was like high-fiving the Bigfoot. It was
gigantic. The hand was powerful. And I heard
vo and it left and it I was shaking. Jackie had jumped up and she was on me and
Chuck was under us and he came up like what happened, you know, like nobody
knew what happened but me. I had just touched a Bigfoot and I know that that's what it was cuz if it was a bear, we
would have been eaten. We would have been mauled and that tent would have been torn up. So, and and honestly, it
had this feeling like a human hand. I felt the energy of that thing. It was
just it was gigantic. And the palm was as big as my whole hand.
And I heard the uh from him or it it left
off the back of the tent. And it's the same place that two weeks or three weeks before we had had this weird fog move in
and I had followed the sound of whatever that was in the woods until we got to the road. And I think it was the same
thing. So that was up at Pasa Picacho outside of um Julian. I think they're
all related. All of that's related. And experience one, you're open to
enough or something clicks in you that you're accepting to that because it didn't it wasn't so scary until it came
down on my head. Once I touched it and pushed with all my might scream, "Get
out of here." It did. It did. And we went back to that
campground many times and never had anything like that. Oh, it stunk. That's
the what? They could smell it. That's the whole thing. They could smell it, too. So, it's it definitely happened
because I was already sitting up when and very aware of, oh, something's out there. You know, the first thing I
thought of, uhoh, it could be a bear. And we were very prepared that we didn't have anything in the tent with this and
everything was locked in the car, but that doesn't always stop them from coming in anyway. So,
so once again, Susan found herself pretty much alone and isolated with her unusual experiences, particularly that
second one, the Bigfoot pushing its hand down on the tent. Uh, she was the only
one who experienced that. So, that's an added level of stress certainly. But
life goes on. She and her husband finally were successful. They had two
kids, a son and a daughter. But following the birth of her son, a couple
of years later, she started experiencing some gynecological problems that ultimately necessitated having a
hyerectomy. And it was following this that she found out some medical mysteries about herself
that really puzzled her doctor and of course Susan. Following Susan's surgery,
the doctor wanted to speak to her. And he told her, "Everything went fine, but
I've never seen anything like what I found in you. Your right ovary has
totally disappeared down to a little scar tissue. It was totally missing."
And he told her that it looked as though her appendix had exploded at some prior time, that there was evidence of a prior
surgery with cauterization, exposure to high heat. It looked like there was a
little laser scar on the appendix. Whatever had occurred, the doctor said it had been done years ago. He said he
had never seen what he found inside her appendix. These small little pellet-sized balls of hard matter, so he
couldn't be sure what that was. He was baffled by it. And he looked at Susan with questioning eyes, asked her if she
had ever had surgery before. because in her paperwork she said that no, she had never had surgery other than a brief
surgery on her left ankle. So she had no idea how to explain what he was telling her. And the doctor said, "Well, in your
belly button, you've got this inch long scar. You've had some kind of surgery or we wouldn't have found all this." Now
Susan knew she had never had surgery. She didn't know what to say about all of this. She had no answer. So she and her
doctor were equally confused. She left the hospital 2 days later to recoup at
home and then returned to work. She often thought about the doctor's findings, didn't share it with anyone.
It was all too strange and confusing. So she had no idea what had happened to her, and she had no way to explain it.
She did wonder if this whole thing had something to do with that strange encounter in the desert years earlier in
1978. those nine hours of missing time and she wondered perhaps if this was a
healing or intervention from these beings. What else could she think? It was just another strange unexplained
occurrence. And once again, there was no one to talk to about it. So here's here's the here's the real
grabber here. Um after I had my ch I couldn't get my period right and I just
was sick for three years and I had gone to two different doctors. We got to do something. So I finally went to a doctor
in Ventura and I said he said well okay can't I got a couple options and I said no let's just have a hyctomy that's the
only option let's just do it I don't want any more children and I can't stand living and you know that controlling me
anymore cuz I was a fun person and it was it was bothering me so I go in and
have the hyctomy and the next morning when the doctor comes
in he says you told me you had never had surgery before. And I said, "No, I
hadn't." But during while I was pregnant with my daughter, I had a hip cast on
and I was on a walker and eight surgeries on my ankle. But never have I
had any kind of surgery, you know, my girly parts. So he said, "Well, that's really bizarre
because what I found was on your right side where you're having all that pain,
your right ovary was missing and the fallopian tube had been attached to your
appendix and at some time your appendix had exploded or burst and then been
folded up nice and neat and sealed. filled with some kind of high
carterization like a laser and we don't use that. So what is this?
I had no idea. I I knew but I wasn't about to say oh that's when I got beamed
up. I mean you just don't do that. So you know he
asked me again later on that day I am so confused by this. Oh, and then he told
me inside when he had taken my appendix out, he said, "Here's the real kicker. When I took your appendix out,
inside it was a sack of
pelletsized, like hard rocky, like raisin pellets.
It was full of those." And I don't even know what those are. So, we're going to
send this off. Well, I never heard about that again, what that was. And I don't
know if he sent it off, but I was so weirded out the fact that
he found something foreign in me and that I had conceived two kids and only had one left over and all that time I
had all that pain on that side. So,
what do you say to that? Once again, Susan found these unexplained experiences kind of stacking
up in her life. UFO sightings, medical mysteries, Bigfoot encounters,
and of course, it was more than that. The vast majority of UFO contactes
start experiencing a profound number of paranormal and psychic experiences. And
that was absolutely true with Susan. It became an almost daily thing with little premonitions and synchronicities
and just paranormal events of all kinds. And in fact, there were so many of them,
she kind of earned this nickname which they would call Susan's world cuz she
lived in this world of unexplained events. And everyone who knew her became aware of this because it was so common
for Susan. One memorable psychic event occurred one evening when Susan's daughter came home from a date and Susan
could tell she was lying about where she had been. So she listened to the story and said, "That's weird cuz I saw you in
somebody's basement drinking beer and playing charades." And her daughter became immediately frustrated because
this was something her mother always did. And Susan's daughter admitted, "Well, that's exactly what I did. She
couldn't lie to her her because her mom was remote viewing her. As Susan says, I
knew. I literally saw her. I was in the room with her. I didn't want to be. It's
not like I tried to see what she was doing. Her son was a little bit more rebellious. And occasionally Susan had
to drive around to find him. And she learned that if she just mentally asked for help, she could locate him. And as
Susan says, I would say, "Angels, can you just show me where he is?" And every
single time, it never failed. The next turn I made, the car lights would shine on him, he would get in the car, and I
would bring him home. So, there's some kind of guidance. So, these weird psychic events and intuitions and
synchronicities were a pretty much daily occurrence. Became very well known among Susan's family and friends. Became a
well-worn joke. They called it Susan's world. Life marched on. Susan didn't
share her UFO experiences with anyone. She tried, but nobody around her showed any real interest in this subject. And
besides, her own experiences seem to have come to an end. But still, in the back of her mind, she knew that one day
she would have to explore what happened to her. And this encounter continued to affect her. As she says, "I had a major
fear of a lot of things. I feared it would happen again. I was afraid to be alone. She deliberately avoided going
anywhere near Utah. Only later did she consciously realize that this was probably because of that encounter that
she might have a repeat experience. Sadly, in 2002, Susan's father passed
away. The evening of the funeral, she and her sister stayed up late looking through a photo album and reminiscing.
And that's when they saw this cluster of sparkly lights appear in the corner of the room. And Susan knew instantly that
it was her father. She could sense it. Both she and her sister observed these lights until Susan became overcome with
curiosity. And she walked up to them and stuck her hand among them. And she
immediately could feel her father's presence. As she says, it was like a last hug goodbye. Her sister was
frightened, but Susan found the experience comforting. And all through my life, I would see what was getting
ready to happen. And when you got kids, you got to kind of like stop it because if you don't, you're going to have a
disaster because my son was very, very active and not the usual. And um he took
a lot of time. And that was my superpower. Every time he ran away to
find him, I literally would say out loud, "Angels, I need you now." As I'm driving, I would just scream it out.
Angels, I need you now. And every time I would know exactly where to turn and the
lights would hit him and he'd go and get in the car. Yeah. Pretty much all the contacties
I've interviewed experienced many paranormal and psychic events. So in a way that's not all that unusual, but for
the people who have to deal with this, yeah, it can be stressful. So Susan has pretty much moved on with
her life. Her kids grew up, they moved out. She and her husband became empty
nesters and at that point she discovered her husband's infidelities
and she and her husband decided to separate and this allowed Susan a lot
more free time to work on herself and really think about her life path and all
the things that had happened to her. She's a very successful artist. You can see some of the drawings of her
experiences in this video. She she makes little mermaid houses and things like
this. Uh so she's really working on herself and it became time to sort of
look back on her life and look into this one experience on the desert highway in
1978 with this UFO encounter to try to figure out what happened. She finally
felt like she had found the strength and courage to really face this head on in a
way that she had never done before. And this is where it got super interesting because it was on May 3rd, 2022 that she
decided, you know what? I'm just going to go to my computer, type in the word UFO, and see what I can find. And by
this incredible synchronicity, what came up was a film called Alien
Abduction Answers by John Yoast. It had been released that very day. This was
such an incredible synchronicity that she ended up reaching out to John Yoast.
And this really began her journey of discovery and healing to figure out what
exactly happened to her on that fateful night in 1978
on this desert highway in Utah. So looking at this movie, Alien Abduction
Answers by John Yoast, Susan learned that he himself was an experiencer
seeking answers and that his movie was part of his journey to find answers. It was so weird that that movie was
premiering that very day. The synchronicity was so incredible that Susan decided to buy the movie, but it
filled her with anxiety. It took her a long time to watch this movie. She kept
turning it off because everything felt so familiar that it made her anxious and
almost nauseous. It made her own experience come rushing back to her
almost to the point that she was reliving it. So this was an incredible revelation for her. So after watching
this movie, she knew that the time had come to allow herself to confront her experience. She knew it was time to
investigate the facts of that strange encounter in the desert. As Susan says,
I've always known it wasn't time to talk about it, but John's movie said, "It's
time." So, she reached out to him and to her surprise, he wrote back to her and
after hearing about her experiences, John suggested that she contact Debs
Shakti Buller, a quantum hypnotherapist who was featured in this film.
So Susan did her research on devs and was very pleased with her approach to this subject and booked a session. She
was very nervous on the day of the session, but at the same time she felt as though John Yoast had almost saved
her life by making this movie. So despite her anxiety, she moved forward with hypnosis. And to her delight, this
session was a huge success. She was able to relive the experience as kind of
quote an objective reporter. With Deb's skillful guidance, she was taken back to that fateful night in September 1978. As
she and Karen drove along this remote desert highway in Utah under hypnosis, she recalled driving by the little town
of Enoch at about 9:30. She relived watching the sun go down, the stars
filling up the desert sky, the moon rising to her right low over the mountain range, and then suddenly
noticing that the moon had disappeared. She relived the car coming to a stop and staring in shock at these giant jack
rabbits standing like centuries on the highway in front of them. She and Karen stepped out of the car and were staring
in alarm at these unmoving figures. 20 or more of these giant jack rabbits just
standing there. She remembered the car headlights going dark, the engine going off, the deafening silence as the music
died away, and then a blinding bright light shining down from above. And that's when Susan let out a soft scream.
The first 17 seconds I just melted into
a pile of tears out of my chair onto my
bed fetal position first 17 seconds. I don't it was every all the terror all
everything. So I watched the first five minutes getting creeped out hair on my body
standing up feeling nauseous. H blink blink blink blink memory memory
memory. It was not comfortable and then within
turned it off few minutes later came back turned it off. I had to process it
and digest it for a while and the day after I have never ever done
this in my whole life. I I I am not a celebrity kind of person.
Everybody's good at something and special at something. And so I've never really thought celebrities like celebrity, but I reached out to John on
Facebook and I said, "Help. I just watched your movie." And it triggered
every thing in me and now I need help.
Prior to going under hypnosis, Susan really had no memory of what happened during this missing time. Of course, she
did remember all the events leading up to it, but 9 hours of missing time is
quite a long time. So, she was very curious to find out what she would remember under hypnosis, and of course,
it was very successful. She remembered being taken on board a craft and all the
events that occurred when she was on board. Susan was amazed at what she recalled. As she says, I saw myself
floating up and I saw the car float up and being in that room that had no
corners was a curved environment that glowed a soft blue everywhere. Not
bright, but soft blue. Everything looked fuzzy, kind of like a hologram because I
could see through it. I was sitting on a table with my feet hanging down. Even the floor looked fuzzy. I was alone but
looked around for my friend Karen and there was what looked like a railing but
it wasn't attached to any kind of wall. It just floated about 5 ft in front of me. I could not move my head to look
around but the floor and ceiling appeared amorphous. So this room was small. The lighting in
it was diffused slightly blurred. But standing directly next to Susan she
could see a small gray ET. It had light-coled skin but had the same dark
eyes and large bald head. And like the rest of the room, it looked a little blurred to her. So Susan's eyes met the
gray and she asked telepathically, "Can I touch you?" The gray being ascented
said, "Yes." So Susan reached out and ran her fingers down its arm. And she
said the skin felt tight, kind of waxy and cold. It seemed to wrinkle slightly under her touch. reminded her of thin
styrofoam wrapping used in packing, and she quickly withdrew her hand in disgust, thinking to herself, "Ew."
Now, this seemed to amuse the gray. He seemed to be amused at her reaction, and
he replied telepathically, "No, not ew. You are me and I am you." So, she asked,
"Where's Karen?" The little gray replied, "She is with you having her own
experience." This is when Susan's attention was drawn to these silver
rails cuz there was movement above them. She could now see these images flashing
rapidly, blinking, and she was absolutely shocked by what they showed. As Susan says, the images were exactly
the same thing that I remember seeing in those recurring dreams as a child. the
military tanks in the street, bombs and destruction around us, dark skies and
starvation. She felt the same dire warning that she had felt as a child,
which was quote, "If we don't change our ways and you can't make a difference,
this will happen. We would have wars in our streets and chaos. Every one of you
has got to make a change because if you don't, this is what's going to happen.
As Susan says, it stressed my responsibility as a human being to do my
best and pass on the word to others. Susan was then instructed to lay down on
this table. The beings began to work on her body. She felt a brief moment of pain on her right side where her right
ovary was. She saw them use a tool of some kind on the left side of her neck.
They then rolled her over and did something to her back. It wasn't too painful, but she did feel
some pressure. And she says they felt like pressure from some kind of air gun going into me. I flinched and pulled
away. But afterwards, she sat back up and again asked where her friend Karen
was. And the gray repeated, "She is with you. She is having her own experience."
Susan wanted to turn around, but she couldn't. And as Susan says, I couldn't see her or find her. I could only move a
little bit, but I couldn't turn around. Now, she did have a distinct and very clear mental impression that they were
far above the Earth and surrounded by stars. She could see it in her head. Even though she didn't look out any
windows, she knew she was above the Earth. And the next thing Susan recalled, she was dropping out of the
craft, flying through the sky, plummeting towards the earth at great speed, straight down. As Susan says, I
was coming down, going through layers and layers of atmosphere and what felt like clouds. I could see the curve of
the earth below me. The sun wasn't up from the mountains yet, but while I was
falling, I could see the rays of the sun illuminated across the red ground below me. The red sun shone through the
mountain passes below until it rose enough to cover the whole ground below with red sunrise. Every red bluff and
messa were lit up like fire. I could feel the moisture. I could hear the whoo
of the air speeding past me. I remember burning. I felt the sun or something
like a hot knife burning my skin. And I knew that was when I had gotten these burns. But it was a beautiful sight from
above, especially when I got to the red rock below. I remember being so scared
that I was going to go splat when I hit the ground. The fear at that time was
immeasurable. Pure adrenaline craziness like jumping out of an airplane with no
parachute because all that reasoning was going on. Why am I here? How am I
falling through the sky? Oh my god, I can see the curve of the earth. My mind was going through what I was seeing and
was trying to reason. I could feel the burns. I could see the earth. And then instantly I was inside the diner with
Karen and was waking up. of the entire experience. It was this part that frightened Susan most. At no point did
she feel this experience was malicious. But the feeling of being burned was, as she says, awful. So, she did also
remember getting a glimpse of this craft that she had been inside. And she says it had a flat bottom and the top looked
like an egg, but more rounded. It was huge. Whatever it was, it was huge
because it blocked out the moon and the stars above it. I wanted to go to where the doors were open on the car. I want
to know why the heck we got out of the car and we didn't just like and plow through those rabbits, which I I love
animals and Karen did, too. But in today's world, I think we would have just gone zoom and flown by, but we were
just not we were we were taken over by something else already. I I I and and
all I can say is I didn't see it, but I felt it and it
was huge, gigantic, because it blocked out all of the light from mountain to
mountain. Literally from side to side of the road, completely blacked out. And it
had to be huge. So all of these memories came flooding back. And when I was under
hypnosis, I remember, this is really weird. I remember, let's say, everybody's
probably done this, but you know, if you're driving down the road and you got a a a child or a sack of groceries or a
pet in the seat beside you, when you hit your brakes really quick, you throw your arm over naturally. I don't know if it's
a mother thing or I wasn't a mother then. It's just it's just a natural thing to do to protect the person that
you're with. Well, I remember grabbing Karen with my left arm and lunging
towards her to hold her back. And the only reason I think I did that is because we were moving. We were lifting
up. And I that was my reaction to grab her as we lifted up. Now, I don't know
anything about the car, but the car had to be lifted up, too, because the mileage was missing and the gas was still there. that is more bizarre than I
can explain or there's no there's no reasoning for that. It is just it is what it is. So,
um I remember the entity beside me was
still gray and it wasn't a rabbit. I kind of wish it was a jack rabbit, but
it wasn't. It was right beside me. And uh I remember having I I could not look at
it in the eyes. I it was no eye contact. I would look up a little bit and look
down. And I remember that happening when I was young, too. When I was real young, no looking in their face.
And um I I it's really weird. Um,
it seems to be a cultural thing. In Mexico, I noticed
that a lot of the children looked down all the time. They don't look up, they look down a lot. And I noticed that uh
when I worked in Chula Vista, there was a lot of kids around the apartment complex and they would always have their
heads down. And I associated it with that when I would watch the children and I would think, I wonder why their head's
always down. And I I wonder because that's how I felt when I was young. And so I would watch them and I would think
about this as an adult. But I when when I was in the craft, I was on a table with my legs hanging. And I remember
thinking, "I really want to touch him. I really want to touch him." And and he
said, "Okay, you can touch me." But he didn't say it with his mouth. He said it in my head. Yeah, you can touch me. And
I remember running my finger down his arm, which
was really long and weird long fingers, and it felt like um
packing rubber. Packing rubber. Thin and underneath was
um soft, but packing. Not like our skin, more
like um more like a dolphin, but like that packing stuff that you the long sheets
of it that are that are about this thick. And then um I I remember pulling
my finger away and thinking said and it said in my head, "Oh, it's
not ew. I'm just like you. You are just like me." Just like that. And I thought
I remember being like and then calming down and then um I remember being laid
down and I don't know what happened but the that pain in my right side I
remember something was going on in my right side and I still don't know what yet
but um that's what happened. So that was in 78.
And um I remember a little bit during the hypnosis that a hand was passed back
behind me. And then something right here was um like a a what do they call it?
Pneumatic gun. Like um like they used in the military
when we all got this the swine flu shots. And it it injects you with air.
And that's what that felt like on my neck because I do remember that part. Well, I I saw the same images that were
flashing as a child. And this time it came with a message,
not just images. And it said if you don't change the way you and everyone
else, you've got to learn to love each other and respect each other and take
care of the world, take care of the earth. and or or this that you're seeing is going to be what happens to you.
Now, I took that personally as a child when I saw those.
You was it from watching war movies with my dad? No, because this was much more
extreme. This was a warning, but I was too young to understand it. But as an
adult, when you get that flash, flash flash, all of that happened when I was
on board. And it was a very clear message and it said, "You are love.
You've always been love and you have to stay love." And that message has always
been in me. And it was so hard when I went through the divorce because I had
it's the first time in my whole life that I've not felt loved. by somebody else and and had been told,
"I do not love you." And that literally took me down because I was hearing
and seeing that finger, you are love in my head. You are love and love will fix
all of this if you can just stay in love. Just always be love. That was
the message that could change the earth. That's only it's so basic. It's just so basic to
respect people, to be kind to be to people, to listen to what they have to say, not preconceived judgment.
Um, it changed me when I had somebody say, "I do not love you." And it took me
10 years to get that love back. And this is part of getting it back is I finally
have learned I am love. Oh yeah. I have always been love. I have always given
love. I don't if if I have seemed
um assertive. Is that a good word for it?
Um like an assertive woman. You know what we get called other than assertive. That's only been as a strength for my
family. And I was very assertive to keep all this away out of my family and out
of my home. But it took this last 10 years for me to know that
it's a safe time now. and having John and Debs intervene, I got in a little
bit deeper and I found that the circle that I was with really lifted me up
um and understood what I had been through because most of the people had been through that too. The conscious
memories and the hypnosis memories are completely different. It's when you tell the story that they blend a little bit,
just a little bit because most of it was conscious memory. I wish I remembered more, but I think
it's enough. So, the hypnosis worked. It worked beautifully. And this was a huge turning
point for Susan cuz she now remembered everything almost that occurred during this onboarding segment. She didn't
remember exactly how she was returned. Karen, the other participant, didn't
remember anything, but this incident did cause Susan to reach out to Karen. Uh,
so they became friends again after not talking for quite some time. So that was another positive result of investigating
her encounter. And there was another thing that turned out to be quite interesting.
Susan finally found out what happened to the mystery of this missing shoe and
everything that happened in the Anza Barago desert decades earlier. So, under hypnosis, Susan was taken back to Anza
Berego. She recalled seeing herself floating up out of the jeep where she was sleeping and shooting upwards at
high speed. And as she says, I was taken out of the jeep and I saw the shoe slip
off my foot and land on a hill below. didn't remember seeing any grays or anything of what happened that night,
but she did remember being returned. As she says, "When I went back, it was so
amazing. I saw where my shoe was. I saw it from above coming down. And I
remember seeing every one of those guys, their bodies laying on the ground around the jeep. It was shocking. I didn't come
down hard. I saw myself being returned gently and floating down in the jeep. I
was just set back down. I don't remember any grays. I only remember the movement
of lifting up, seeing my shoe slip off and fall below me, then coming back and
being floated back down. I don't remember anything else. This hypnosis
brought a lot of clarity and confirmation to her early childhood encounters with the weird face looking
through the window at her because, as Susan says, it was the same creature. It
wasn't just visual. It's the exact same feeling. It's a knowing that the presence is the exact same presence
throughout the years. I didn't know anything about the shoe until after I had hypnosis.
And at the end of the hypnosis, I saw it and I screamed out on the
videotape, there's my shoe, my foot. And I also saw and I remembered seeing I
remembered the memory of seeing all those guys from above
laying on the ground. So that must have been when I was coming down to the jeep.
It's the only thing I could think of. It was literally a visual of them all sleeping from above.
And that's the only thing I could think of because that's what happened during the hypnosis. It it came back, but it
was a very familiar memory. I just had forgotten that part, but I didn't
remember, you know, that coming down that coming down and seeing them. I don't know how I ever forgot that, but
it was locked away. When I saw it, I literally screamed out in the videape, "Oh, it's the shoe." The first thing
when I came out of hypnosis, the first thing I I said is, "Oh, I can't I I know I can't call the guys and tell them, but
I really wish I could call the guys and tell them I know about the shoe. Grizzlies passed and I don't know the
other two guys." And Rick, I don't know if you'd be open to that, so I just haven't. But but I thought it was
hilarious that after all these years, 45 years later, I know where my shoe went. And it it was a beautiful thing. It was
so relieving and hilarious because I started laughing even in hypnosis. It
just tickled me to my depth when I saw it float off in like in a slow motion.
So, the whole hypnosis session worked out really well for Susan. It answered so many of the questions. Now, she
finally understood why she was having these dreams from a very young age about
war and bombs and tanks in the street and people starving. This was exactly
the same message she had received when she was taken on board as an adult. It's
clear that the ETSs are very much concerned about this. In fact, as Susan says, it showed me the urgency to stop
the warlike ways on this planet or we would perish. It showed me that love and
nothing but love will change the world. And this is how Susan operates. She very
much allows love and truth to guide her actions and facing her encounters headon
turned out to be an incredibly healing event. She found the strength and courage to share her story not only in
my book humanoids and high stranges but with Richard Banisk the muon researcher
Earl Gray. She worked again with John Yoast of Alien Abduction Answers and Deb
Shockti and started doing podcasts. So she really found a lot of strength by
coming forward and sort of came full circle and the whole event turned out to
be an incredibly healing adventure. So coming forward was the right thing for
her and it really helped her to deal with this incredible encounter that had
changed her life so many years ago. It was a very healing thing that she did. Now Susan's not sure, but she thinks
that the purpose of this encounter in the desert may have actually been to heal her. As she says, "I don't know
everything that happened during those nine hours, but I think I had a healing." This encounter in the desert
changed her in so many ways. She's become an avid environmentalist. She appreciated the boost it gave her
with her psychic abilities, which she now calls her superpowers. She has always lived her life with pure
unconditional love and positivity. And despite some of the fear and the burns
she received, she is glad and grateful to have had this encounter. As she says,
"I think it was positive. It's my truth and it is what it is." Like many
experiencers, she's not sure why these encounters happened to her. As far as she knows, nobody else in her family has
had an experience with an ET. She had always believed her desert encounter was an extraterrestrial experience. And now
that she has had hypnosis, there's no doubt whatsoever in her mind. And it was
in 2023 that she did reach out to Karen by phone and they reunited after almost
45 years. Karen confirmed this trip. she remembered it in vivid detail, but as
far as the encounter, the only thing she can remember is the missing time. And she says that she's mostly glad she
doesn't remember meeting the ETs. But like Susan, she is still seeking answers
and has developed an interest in this subject. After all these years of not knowing the whole story, Susan says
proudly, "I am an experiencer. Now is the time to tell my story of what
happened to me in 1978 in Utah. I feel almost like generations of weight have
lifted off of me. There's no burden. I have most of the conscious memory of that night. But I'm so glad I reached
out to John Yost and Deb's shocki for help. The whole experience has changed my life. Once I allowed myself to
investigate it, it all became more comforting and less fearful. After more than 45 years of waiting to know the
truth that night, I'm thrilled I know the truth. This experience and the
amazing people I have met during it have changed my life in so many wonderful ways. Retrieving those lost memories has
given me great hope and clarity for my future. It's been the most amazing adventure of my lifetime, and there's
plenty more to come. I will forever investigate the facts of those memories, and I will always look for that diner.
Mufon has been amazing and such a great help. I feel I have done the right thing by making a report as it's important for
everyone to report the facts. So Susan of course is looking forward to the
future with a new attitude. She is very grateful for all that happened and these paranormal things that have brought
weirdness to her life. And as she says, "At this time in my life, it's time to
discover more magic. I've lived it all my life and there's no stopping it now."
So there you go. That's the lifetime encounters of Susan Wear. Thank you,
Susan. I can't thank you enough for sharing your story, not only with me and
in my book, Humanoids and High Stranges. So check it out, you guys, if you want to hear the whole story because I really
kind of summarized it here. But sharing it with the world, this is very difficult to do. This the climate is
still pretty hostile. There's a lot of skepticism and disbelief. There's ridicule. Witnesses are regularly gas
lit for sharing their story. But I think it's really important for people to come forward because I know there's a lot of
people out there who are having the same kinds of experiences that Susan did. And
if you want to hear more about her story, you can certainly check out the 2hour interview that Dolly and I did on
the light gate with Susan. Also check out the film by Steve Neil, the Jack
Rabbit Abduction. Uh remember this was the case that Muon chose as the case of
the year for 2023. Thanks quite a much to the hard work of
Earl Gray and Richard Vanisk who really helped Susan to investigate her
encounter. So it's truly an amazing case. I think it shows really well how a
person can move on a journey through fear and confusion to understanding and
healing. It's amazing to me how many people get this same sort of message
that humanity has become far too violent and that we are on the pathway towards self-destruction.
This is the message ETSs give over and over again. So, it's really up to us to listen and I think this is why it's so
important that people like Susan come forward with their encounters. So, thank you Susan once again. You know I love you dearly. I love all of you too. Thank you so much for watching. I
truly appreciate it. Until next time, keep asking those questions. Keep searching for the truth. 
Most important of all, keep having fun. And I'll see you next time.
