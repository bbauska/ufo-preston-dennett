"I WAS TAKEN ONBOARD A UFO!" TEN ASTONISHING TRUE CASES
May 5, 2023

Summary:
May 5, 2023
There is no experience quite like an onboard UFO encounter. A simple sighting is undeniably interesting, but often they can be misperceived and misinterpreted. Even UFO landings and face-to-face encounters tell us nothing about what it’s like inside a craft. Onboard UFO encounters are so close-up that it’s virtually impossible to misperceive the experience. Witnesses are not only touching the UFO, they are breathing the air inside it, smelling the odors, hearing the sounds, and communicating directly with the extraterrestrials. It is cases like these where we learn the most about ETs, who they are, where they come from, why they are here and their agenda on our planet.

Cases of people being taken onboard are far more numerous than most people realize. In fact, many researchers believe that millions of people are having these experiences. They’ve been taking place for many years and occur all over the world.

This video (and article) present ten cases of people who have had this astonishing type of encounter. Many of these are multiple witness cases involving physical evidence such as landing traces, EM disturbances and medical effects, both injuries and healings. They show remarkable commonalities, and also unique features. In some of the cases, the witnesses were able to hold long interactive conversations with the ETs and learned a great deal of information.

CASE 1: BARBARA SCHUTTE. After attending a UFO convention in 1981, Barbara Schutte of Wever, Iowa learned that she herself was having UFO experiences. After undergoing hypnosis, she learned she was a lifelong abductee and was given an important life mission by the ETs to help educate the world about UFOs.

CASE 2: CYNTHIA VODOVOZ. In Oct 1973, Cynthia Vodovoz (age 12) was driving with her mother to ballet class in Birmingham, AL when they had a missing time UFO encounter. Later, under hypnosis, Cynthia recalled being pulled onboard and examined. It was to be the first of many other encounters.

 CASE 3: MARTHA THRONE. While driving with her husband, Ernest in Sonora, CA, on Oct 30, 1977, Martha Throne was floated out of her car and into a UFO. She was physically examined by human-looking ETs, and was amazed to see hundreds of ETs onboard. The experience was profoundly benevolent and was spiritually transforming.

CASE 4: PATRICK EUDY. It was Mar 9, 1979. Driving near his home in Monroe, NC, Patrick Eudy found himself and his car being sucked up into a craft. Inside, he was examined by ETs, and was later taken to the control room. Looking out a window, he saw the Earth far below him. He was returned to a location many miles away with almost no memory of the event. It wasn’t until 2 years later that he went under hypnosis and learned what had happened to him.

CASE 5: LULI OSWALD & FAUZE MEHLEN. On Oct 15, 1979, Luli Oswald and her student Fauze Mehlen were pulled onboard a craft and examined by short beings with a “rat-like” appearance. They told Luli they had contacted her because of her abilities with ESP. The ETs seemed most interested in Fauze and told Luli that she was of no use to them.

CASE 6: MEGAN & RENEE ELLIOTT. On Aug 21, 1980, Megan Elliott and her daughter (age 1 ½) were driving near Lake Fork Creek in TX, when they were pulled with their car into a craft. Megan was examined and her daughter was healed of two illnesses. The ETs brought them to another room and gave them strange pellets of food. They then answered many of Megan’s questions about who the ETs are and why they had taken her.

CASE 7: RUBEN MENESES. It was Oct 15, 1981 when truckdriver Ruben Meneses was pulled with his truck into a craft. Ruben was badly traumatized and after being released from the craft many miles away, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Since the encounter, he suffers from light sensitivity.

CASE 8: VIV HAYWARD, ROSEMARY HAWKINS & VALERIE WALTERS. After a night at the disco, three friends, Viv Hayward, Rosemary Hawkins and Valerie Watkins drove home and experienced 20 minutes of missing time. Under hypnosis, they recalled that they were taken together onboard a craft.

CASE 9: INDU SHAH. In 1985, while hiking near the Ganges River in Bihar, India, 17-year-old Indu Shah was missing for 3 days. She was found wandering dazed and disoriented with burns on her skin. Under hypnosis, she recalled a harrowing onboard experience with strange ETs.

CASE 10: ANGELO & GRACIA RICCI. While picnicking near Cadore in the Italian Alps on Aug 15, 1986, Angelo and Gracia Ricci watched a UFO land next to them. 7-foot-tall ETs came out and carried them onboard and gave them a strange exam.

Ten cases, from all across the planet, each providing profound insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon, and each adding another piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. Cases like these are impossible to deny. They leave no doubt that we are being visited, that we are not alone in this amazing infinite universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode is called I was taken on board a UFO 10 astonishing true cases 
while sightings are undeniably interesting they're open to misinterpretation or misperception 
and that's even true with cases involving Landings but when someone is taken on board 
a UFO when they're face to face with the ETS when they're touching the craft itself 
these are cases that are very hard to explain away as anything other than what they appear to be 
so these are also the cases that provide us the most information sightings are very limited in 
what they can tell us about ETS and their agenda but when someone is taken on board physically 
examined speaks to the ETS has a conversation we learn a lot more about the ETS who they are 
why they're here and what their agenda is on our planet and that's what these cases are all about 
these are all cases involving onboard experiences where people most cases do have missing time 
uh these cases also involve considerable interaction between the people who are taken on 
board and the ETS many different types of ETS as well in fact that's what I wanted to do with this 
episode is kind of provide a broad spectrum of different types of cases from all over the world 
I have cases from across the United States some in South America including Argentina and Brazil 
there's one interesting case from India I've got a case from Italy a case from England as we all 
know this is a worldwide phenomenon and these cases definitely reflect that these are the 
most extensive type of UFO encounter a person can have perhaps excluding cases of crash retrievals 
but yeah being taken on board a UFO there's nothing quite like it this is something that 
absolutely changes people's lives people do have strong physical evidence of these cases many of 
these are multiple in this cases there's one case involving a healing some involving other 
physiological reactions so yeah very remarkable on many levels got a bunch of cases that are and 
a lot of information so let's just get started the first case I'd like to talk about took place 
mostly in Weaver Iowa it's a great case the main witness is Barbara shut a nurse so a good witness 
she's allowing her real name to be used she's had multiple experiences over a period of years 
now Barbara shot the main witness first discovered that she was having contact as 
an adult after attending a UFO conference and she went home and some weeks later she started waking 
up to find inexplicable bruises and marks on her body so now knowing a little bit about the subject 
she realized that she had many incidents in her life pointing towards contact and she eventually 
contacted UFO researcher Dr Leo sprinkle who was really one of the first researchers to use 
hypnosis to recover missing time so Barbara went under hypnosis with Dr Leo sprinkle and uncovered 
multiple incidents of contact in her life and as Leo sprinkle says it's a remarkable story 
so I'll just quote Barbara directly here regarding her first experience as she says 
the first known abduction was in 1959 at the age of eight I was examined by an alien a sample of 
Flesh was taken from the first finger of my left hand the scar remains to this date but 
we became friends the alien told me he would see me again he would teach me what I needed 
to know later and that someday I would be doing important work when I grew up I would understand
so Barbara under hypnosis recalled seeing shorter ETS and a tall one who wore a uniform 
with a large V design on it and he actually gave Barbara his name he said his name was quasgaa 
I found that incredibly interesting because that's almost exactly the same name that 
Betty andreasen's main contact was quasca so I'm wondering if this could be the same ET 
at any rate Barbara's next encounter that she was able to recall occurred when she was 22 years old 
and again as she says in her own words the second known abduction was on April 17 1973 
there was a time loss involved I was dematerialized in my car and 
taken out up through the roof into an alien craft I was in various rooms with 
smaller alien types and the same alien as in my childhood experience of 1959. 
so if she describes the little grazes being quite friendly and she says they are little 
like children they make me smile I don't see any ears they have no hair their eyes are black their 
mouth is like a hole they have baby soft skin lighter than ours after the examination I told 
the aliens I would do my best not to disappoint them I was returned to my car through the roof 
it was just five years later when she had a really dramatic sighting with her brother 1978 
a three large glowing Globes hovering over power lines at a farm in Southeastern Iowa 
so this is when she really started to investigate UFOs on her own but it wasn't long before she had 
another on-board experience as Barbara says the third known abduction was on September 29 1981. 
this time there was some conscious recall I was taken from home onto an alien craft 
Barbara said that the craft itself was shaped like a derby hat it was huge with colored lights and 
she says it's as big as a house with a big dome and a rim going around the bottom I'm going inside 
moving like I'm on a conveyor belt so she was taken inside she believes that she may have been 
drugged as she underwent a complete neurological exam and apparently an implantation she did 
have physical evidence in the form of bruises soreness dizziness nausea and a general malaise 
she didn't notice a strange scar at the level 8th thoracic vertebrae which is still present 
to this day and she had X-rays which showed a compression of the eighth thoracic vertebrae 
so something is going on here and it was following hypnosis to recall this particular incident 
she drove home and when she got home something very strange happened she began to do automatic writing apparently from this E.T the one named quasga 
which she wrote through automatic writing was quote be happy Barbara success is at your 
doorstep we are proud of you you are our special host we will guide you every step of the way 
the E.T quasca actually signed his name and promised to return so they said early on in 
our first onboard case that she was going to be doing important work and this is apparently when 
this started because Barbara began to join various UFO groups and began to do her own investigations 
regarding the sighting in 1978 she actually called the local airport and she was told by 
an airport official that what she saw was quote three geese with lights strapped on their backs 
and the airport officer just hung up on her and as Barbara says that really insulted me 
yeah that is insulting so I think this is what really gave her the encouragement to 
start investigating herself she did find other witnesses to that sighting but they refused 
to speak about it so this is when she formed her own group to help others as Barbara says 
seeing a UFO can be very traumatic it's something you don't know and don't understand people realize how many others saw UFOs then they wouldn't feel so singled out 
that's why we're here to show people that they're not going nuts they're not going insane 
that is something a lot of contactees consider like am I going crazy no I don't think they are 
so many people are having these experiences and Barbara's experiences continued her latest one 
occurred in 1982 as Barbara says in her own words the fourth known abduction was on January 22nd 
1982 local hypnotist did a regression I was taken from home floated across a cornfield into a craft 
an examination with particular interest in wrists and fingers wires or tubes were attached to the 
forehead and fed information she says a tube is inserted to her body and she can feel fluid 
going through her arm and she felt sort of a crawling skin electrical feeling this was the 
same ET quasca plus taller darker clothed beings and she believes that they were preparing her for 
a UFO conference that would take place one month later and she did have physical traces of this 
onboard experience including bruises on both her left and right arm with punctures or needle marks 
which were verified by doctors so this is when Barbara was going totally public 
and apparently as a result she was let go from her job as a nurse which shows how 
important it is that we remove the stigma from people who have onboard experiences 
so this affected her so profoundly that she eventually became an investigator for the J 
Allen heineck Center of UFO studies kufos and later a mufon field investigator researching 
her own cases and helping many other people and in fact she even became a state section director 
for mufon apparently fulfilling the mission given to her by the ETS so needless to say but I'll say 
it anyway she's now a Believer she knows the truth and as Barbara says I used to think it 
was silliness to claim that anybody could be taken aboard a UFO but now I know abductions do happen
that's the first case the second case I'd like to cover occurred in Alabama more specifically along Highway 31 from Morris to Birmingham 
was October 1973 and Cynthia vodavaz then age 12 was being driven by her mother to her ballet class 
and as Cynthia says in her own words I noticed an object it was big and round 
and bright green and had a yellow ring around it it was coming over the trees it stayed with us 
mind you they're on the highway now there's other cars around them they had just passed Gardendale 
when this object began to descend in front of them and Cynthia's mother asked is it going to land 
well it looked like it was and at this point their car actually stalled and several other cars around 
them stopped so there were a lot of witnesses to this incident and as Cynthia says in her own words 
the object kept coming down and seemed to stop near the wires it seemed bigger than a plane 
my mother rolled down the window which really upset me I thought I was going to run 
in the car next to me was a man whose face was lit up he was leaning towards us Cynthia's mom 
actually asked the other driver do you think it's a UFO and the man replied I guess so 
and suddenly a bright light filled their car Cynthia and her mother 
at this point Cynthia felt a strange sort of paralyzing heaviness 
and as she says in her own words the next thing I remember I was sitting in the car seat but my 
feet were in mother's lap and the car door slammed on my back and it woke me up my mother seemed to 
wake up she was trying to start the car this point the UFO was gone they continued the drive to the 
ballet class only to realize that they were quite late 40 minutes late in fact the class was ending 
so they didn't know quite what to make of this at the time it remained a mystery for many years 
Cynthia grew up she pursued a dancing career but as she says for many years I didn't know what had happened only that I had been troubled by something 
but after doing some research she realized that this experience was a typical missing time UFO 
encounter she knew what that meant there was more to this than she remembered and she actually met 
with researcher Bud Hopkins who hypnotized her and no surprise an onboard UFO encounter emerged 
under hypnosis she remembered being taken back to the scene on the highway and while she was 
under hypnosis she remembers thinking that first could this be a car accident because there were 
cars stopped all around them on the highway but it wasn't an accident as Cynthia says 
the people ahead were screaming and putting arms out the window and this thin thing was coming and 
as he passed the car the people were subdued as he got to our car mother rested her head on the door 
then three small beings whitish looking came to my door and opened it I tried to 
put my fingers in the air conditioning vents to hold on but the vents broke 
so at this point Cynthia was floated out of the car with the beings and into a craft 
she found herself in a white room she was laid out on a table next to another table with another girl 
on it and Cynthia says she had kind of Sandy curly hair and she was in the same predicament as me 
they were walking around the table doing an examination I remember they placed a needle 
in my navel that's all she really recalls was being physically examined afterward she found 
herself being placed in what looked like a kind of transparent globe and floated back into the car 
so this affected her very much for the rest of her life as she says I think about it every night 
when I go to sleep and she got married and her husband started having experiences as she says 
they're visiting us together he woke up with an incision Mark two inches long on his back so I 
know it's still happening and she also remembers being taken as a very young girl she would call 
this without regressive hypnosis she recalled being taken on board of craft they showed her a 
small BB like object and told her that they were going to place it in her nose uh it actually did 
cause some pain and she went to the doctor later and he verified that there apparently 
was something a scar at the roof of her mouth where she remembers this being placed in her body 
it's definitely an interesting case and kudos to Cynthia for going public with it
and here's the next case which took place in Sonora California it's quite interesting 
and this again involves to an extent two witnesses this occurred on October 30th 1977. 
the main witness is Martha Thorne she had retired some eight years earlier she was a former horse 
and dog trainer and also a waitress and she and her husband Ernest were driving along Highway 108. 
from Oakdale to their home in Sonora California they had just passed Jamestown this was that 
night when without warning they saw little lights in what looked like a big cloud of bluish smoke 
that quickly enveloped their car the same time their car jerked came to a stop and the headlights 
went out her husband Ernest who had been dozing in the passenger seat woke up and said what happened 
and Martha said oh my God I don't know what's happening she was trying unsuccessfully to start 
the car and this is when they noticed a very large orange bright light moving towards them 
so that quite startled them Martha took her hands off the steering wheel at this point the engine 
suddenly revved to life the light was gone so was the fog and they were traveling along the highway 
and she turned to her husband Ernest what in the hell happened to us and he of course had no idea 
it did notice some strange after effects both their watches stopped at exactly the same time 
they would never run again despite attempts to repair them and they said their car also never 
worked the same and they soon got rid of it so after thinking about this and doing some research 
they realized that this was a missing time encounter and they agreed to go under hypnosis 
Ernest didn't recall anything but Martha did she recalled being taken from her car while 
her husband stayed behind in the car and as Martha says in her own words the car lights 
went out and the engine stopped the car jerked violently backward and began to raise off the 
ground we were in complete darkness I put my head out the window and I saw a 
being about four and a half feet long upside down floating on its belly outside my window 
so she says at this point their car was at least three feet off the ground and these et's place what she believes like a soft snow white blanket over her as she was 
lifted up into what she would soon discover was a spacecraft and she was quite frightened until the 
ETS began talking to her telepathically I said don't worry we won't hurt you 
and she could now see she's looking around she's in a very large room with shiny and bright 
and she was laying on a table and as Martha says it was like going into the belly of the fish it 
was safe I remember thinking I might have died and gone to heaven but of course she didn't die and 
she wasn't in heaven she was on a steel looking Table and there were three figures surrounding her 
she said they looked very human-like but wore skin tight suits that covered everything except their faces she said that they had large round eyes no apparent eyebrows 
flat noses just a slit for a mouth and kind of a quote Smoky looking complexion 
and there were a lot of beings on board this craft she said most of who were busy with other 
things only the three who were around her paid any attention at all to her but looking around she saw 
all kinds of weird sort of white boxed shaped equipment which she believed was electronic but 
yeah a lot of beings as Martha says there were hundreds upon hundreds of little guys working 
on a work table it was amusing in a lot of ways because they were so busy when one of them got 
in the other's way he'd just hop over so this was not a scary experience for her whatsoever 
she felt no fear at this point in fact she felt it was almost a spiritual experience 
and as she says in her own words I've always been a person who would let myself be run over 
and intimidated they said that would not happen anymore I don't know how but I knew what they 
said to me after it was over it was a wonderful experience I don't regret the experience a bit 
so yeah a very positive experience for her though initially quite frightening and her husband verifies it to the extent that he can but it was just her who was taken on board 
Now we move to the next case which took place in North Carolina near Monroe it was late one evening 
on March 9 1979 when Patrick n UD is 43 years old a car salesman he was driving along Sykesville 
Road about 18 miles from his home in Monroe North Carolina and it was just going over a large Steel 
Bridge that spans the Rocky River this is at night when he saw a brilliant floodlight appear overhead 
and as he says in his own words it was brighter than any Searchlight I'd ever seen the next thing 
I knew I was driving along the Morgan Hill Road eight miles from where I'd seen the bright light 
in fact he knows the exact location it was right in front of the GB Helms store
so he was quite dazed at this point his eyes were burning and of course the bridge that he had been 
Crossing was now nowhere in sight he knows it was about 3 A.M when he left it was now 6 
00 am so he had a considerable amount of missing time he drove home he woke up the next morning 
with a very strong feeling that he had been taken on board this craft though he had no specific 
clear memories of it as he says all I had was a dim foggy recollection of being in a spaceship 
of coming face to face with strange creatures so it was over the next few days that he did notice 
an unusual rash and itching sensation on his fingers and ankles and he also noticed something 
else his gas tank was much Fuller than it should have been giving the distance that he traveled 
so he started to speculate at this point that Not only was he taken but his car was taken as well 
it was the only way to explain how there was so much gas in his tank so over the next few weeks and months he had began having very powerful flashbacks 
of being in a strange room sitting in a weird dentist-like chair seeing glowing 
panels and strange creatures surrounding them this caused him all kinds of anxiety and he 
finally decided to see hypnosis just so we could figure out what had happened to him as he says I just couldn't get it off my mind it just kept coming back I wanted to make sure 
so we found a hypnotist by the name of Dr Richard Pino the session lasted two hours but as Pat says 
when it was over I had the answer I was seeking I had been abducted by a UFO under hypnosis he 
recalled his car being pulled into the air and placed into a room that kind of reminded 
him of a car showroom being a car salesman I can see that but he says short creatures 
surrounded him he felt no fear at this point but instead he says he felt almost quote euphoric 
the being that was closest to him was about five feet tall and he asked all kinds of questions 
such as how the craft operated and so far so forth but as Patrick said the being never spoke a word 
and it took him a while to realize what was happening but he was having telepathic communication but he still to this day has a hard time remembering exactly what was being said 
this taller being did seem to be in charge there were other shorter beings he was taken from the room where his car was into a dark room which contained a seat much 
like a dentist's chair that he had seen in his flashbacks and he did feel some fear at this point 
as he says I was really scared I was put in the chair and strapped down I'm still not sure but I 
think the being ran some tests on me he was then laid down on a steel table he says they covered 
his body with a clear odorless liquid while a metallic looking sphere floated over his body 
at one point the beings left the room and this is when he did begin to feel some fear but when they 
returned he said his Euphoria also returned and his fear left remembers then being floated into 
another brightly lit room inside this room there are two chairs and a weird panel and he believes 
this may have been the control room as he says I don't know what the spaceship looked like but now 
I remembered being on board standing in what must have been the cockpit there was a space being it 
was wearing a silvery spacesuit but I couldn't see its face it was covered by a dark visor 
he does remember looking outside a window or Port Hall and saw the Earth far below him 
that's basically what he recalled under hypnosis he was really glad he had the set the session 
because it totally relieved his anxiety as he says going to that night of that encounter has made me 
feel a lot better it brought back things I thought were true and it eased my mind because I knew that 
I wasn't just dreaming this stuff up but I don't think I'll ever be able to shut it out of my mind 
so he initially kept quiet with all this but finally decided to speak publicly 
because he knew that there were others out there going through this and as he says 
there are other people who have seen things and maybe now they'll step forward and tell it like it 
is all right let's move to the next case and this one is quite interesting it took place near Rio De 
Janeiro Brazil and it involves actually someone who's world famous a world famous musician this 
occurred on October 15 1979 and the main witness is Luli Oswald she's a world famous pianist quite 
an interesting person she was actually born as a princess princess Paola D viggiano but was raised 
in secret by another family who agreed to adopt her she was raised by Enrique Oswald a conductor 
and she was 55 years old again 1979 and she was driving with her student Jose Milan age 
25 from Rio De Janeiro Brazil to the town of Sacramento and they saw this luminous actually 
several luminous glowing objects coming up out of the water they're driving along the coast 
and I thought wow we have this amazing sighting but returning back the same way 
they somehow took a wrong turn and again they saw a UFO coming out of the water 
and this time it came out so fast it drew a huge column of water with it 
and as it came overhead oh I mean their cars seemed to be taken over and it began to weave across the road and I said the doors began to open and shut by themselves and 
looking up they could see this huge cigar-shaped object with orange glowing Windows hovering over 
the Mountainside right along next to them they both Drew pictures of it as you can see here 
they then saw three balls of light swooping down towards them at this point everything seemed to 
stop went back to normal and they raced away to a coffee shop and this is when they realized they 
had two hours at least of missing time so Luli eventually went under hypnosis with Dr Silvio Lago 
and she recalled that the car itself was pulled up inside a beam of light into this craft 
she says under hypnosis our car is being grabbed by the top a light from the small 
one the UFO is holding us the light clasps our car we're being held prisoners by this light 
is horrible so she was extremely frightened by this encounter it was not pleasant for her 
she found herself standing in a room outside her car and standing around them were strange looking 
creatures which she said had gray skin thin arms pointed features which actually reminded 
her of rats but she said they had slit-like noses and slit-like mouths and were quite short only 
four and a half feet tall Luli and her companion were both undressed and examined with light beams 
she says they took hair samples from her gave her a gynecological exam and 
they told her that they had contacted her because of her abilities with ESP 
but she they also told her that she was of no real use to them that they were more interested 
in her companion so she thought perhaps it was because of her age being 55 years old 
and no longer able to reproduce that they had no real interest in her but she did say that they 
examined her she said they are putting tubes in my ear there are tubes everywhere they are pulling 
on my hair they look like rats they have huge horrible rat ears and their mouths are like slits 
they're touching me all over with their thin arms there are five of them their skin is 
gray and sickly so you can see her hypnosis session online it is in Portuguese I believe 
but again the ETS were more interested in her student and she saw him laying on a 
marble-like table and looking very pale as she says as though he were dead and they you know 
there's some conflicting reports on this but they told her that they came from quote a small Galaxy 
near Neptune which she knew couldn't be true or from a tunnel under the South Pole and Antarctica 
which she also thought was absurd so that's kind of interesting but both Witnesses said that 
they had several physical ailments afterward though these are not described in any detail 
but it was certainly a case that caused quite a sensation in Brazil at the time that it occurred
and here's the next case that I'd like to talk about which took place in Texas 
and the main witness has decided to be anonymous the investigators call her Megan Elliott this is a 
pseudonym and it was investigated by the mutual UFO Network it took place on August 21st 1980 
this is quite an unusual case Megan and her one and a half year old daughter Renee 
were driving late at night back to their home in Texas after visiting Megan's mother and Megan had 
been planning on staying there longer but Renee had developed an ear infection and 
also had a rash on her leg which was persisting despite doctors repeated attempts to heal her 
so although it was late at night and it was a long drive home 70 miles Megan decided that she 
had better leave for the safety of her child and they were about halfway through the trip back home 
and had just reached the location near Lake Fork Creek when the radio began making strange noises 
shortly later their headlights dimmed and a loud buzzing noise filled the car 
the next thing Megan knew her car a Honda Civic was being levitated up off the highway 
and looking up through the windshield she saw that they were being drawn towards a metallic object 
with a double row of Bright Lights hovering very low above them and just a moment later the car was 
inside this craft and she found herself in a round seamless room brightly lit with no visible light 
source Renee her little one and a half year old was pointing out the windows and saying look mom 
look at this point Megan Heard a Voice in her head telepathically saying Megan get Renee and get out 
of the car so this absolutely terrified her and she says I literally panicked I just sat there and 
I could remember not really shaking but feeling my insides churning and thinking God what do I do now 
so she rolled up the windows and locked the doors at which point a door in this large room opened 
and this weird kind of fog rolled into the room along the floor and shortly later she saw 
a quote little creature and this being this E.T said telepathically get out of the car 
so she describes this as very much like Gray's she said it had a large head no ears no eyebrows 
oval eyes without lashes no hair on the entire body a broad nose with two apertures or nostrils 
the mouth was a little slit thin neck thin body thin arms long fingers four on each hand 
and the skin she said was sort of like the texture of silly putty so she's refusing to open the door 
the car door when she hears a loud click and the car door opens by itself and suddenly falls off 
the hinges this point her fear completely left her she had a feeling of peace and Tranquility come 
over her and this being led Megan and little Renee into a round room inside there were two more grays 
and two tables and she saw a panel covered with colored lights multicolored lights 
and Megan was unable to resist she was very Cooperative as I told her to get up on the table which she did and she says they placed metal clamps about four inches 
wide snap across my ankles my wrist and chest and she looked over at her daughter who was 
also being placed on a table also being held on with clamps and she had no fear at this 
point you know neither did her daughter in fact as Megan says she loves it she's very excited 
a weird yellow Mist sprayed down on them Megan felt a radiating heat or something coming from 
she believes the table she saw a strange Pro black instruments coming down from the ceiling 
on long arms and moving over her body which cause a strange sense of pressure and occasional pain 
she looked over at her daughter and saw that she was also being examined and that a needle-like 
device was being inserted first into her nose and then into her navel so this concerned Megan and 
she's told the ETS don't hurt my baby she's sick and the ETS replied she's not anymore 
after the exam these clamps retracted Megan got off the table voluntarily she could now move on 
her own she saw her daughter crawling around on the table and as Megan says I got her off 
the table she liked them they were then taken into another room where there was a small bed and they 
remained there for quite some time a drawer came out of the wall and had a little white and green and yellow pellets she was told to eat them that it was for their nourishment which both she and 
Renee did she says they melted in the mouth her daughter Renee thought they were little candies 
but Megan is not sure how long they stayed there um she thinks it could be several days or maybe 
even longer uh because she kept falling asleep and eating as she says they told me to eat so 
I would survive the nourishment that our systems require for survival so we ate them and the ETS 
did come into the room periodically they told her that Megan had been very helpful and as she says 
they asked if I was allowed to ask any three questions about the universe that I wanted and was guaranteed an answer what would they be I told them I didn't know and I wanted time to think 
to see what they were and they seem to agree to that she asked them will I ever see my family 
again because she's wondering if she's going to be taken permanently and they said yes but life 
will not be the same things will happen and it begins to change the structure of things 
so she again fell asleep The et's Returned and Megan asked her three questions 
she pointed outside and said what is out there and the ET said can you be more specific in that 
question he said I'm not sure you know that time I saw the stars out the window what were 
those stars and what was out there the ET replied are you referring to just what's outside of where 
you are at this moment or everywhere Megan said everywhere I want to know everything 
the ET replied someday I will answer that question we you are ready but for now 
the Universe goes more than what you could ever imagine or that any person or anyone can imagine 
so Megan's second question was if you are here with us now why don't you make 
yourselves known to us the ET said that isn't about the universe but I will answer anyway 
humans have a tendency for annihilation you are a very fearful population 
and if we interfered in any way the Earth could be destroyed you have to live your life in your 
own way if we made ourselves known it would be a very fearful planet and you'd probably 
destroy yourselves but one way day we will in order to help as Megan says it's almost as if 
they seemed afraid they can't interfere with us because they would be destroyed as well 
so Megan's third question was why me why do you go around picking up mothers and children 
if you can't even tell Earth why you're here and the E.T replied well that's why we're here 
so this kind of freaked her out at which point the ET said be calm we chose samples from the popular population that already exhibited intelligence and 
capabilities of understanding properties and theories beyond the present day time 
so she began to ask more questions which they answered she said where are you from 
they said we're from the same place you are Megan said how could that be if we're so different the 
ET said we are not different on the inside we can think we can reason the Creator made us 
they told her that they did have a planet that they go to and that she'd actually already seen it though Megan has no memory of this she was fascinated about how the door would disappear 
into the wall with no seams so she asked them how they did that and they said it was a type of 
metal they used which allowed it to bond together and disappear at well so at some point she was 
returned back to the car which was lowered back on the road she found herself now only five miles 
from home and so there was apparently no missing time in terms of days or weeks so that's very 
curious she woke up the next morning and mostly only remembered this in sort of a dream state 
but they did notice something Renee's earache and rash were completely gone she was healed 
Megan didn't have some emotional changes she became very pensive and distant 
or a couple of weeks something which all her family and friends noticed two weeks later she's driving along she saw another UFO and had a full-blown panic attack 
fearing that she was going to be taken again this is when she really realized that she had been taken and did go under hypnosis to recall these events 
uh she thought that perhaps the ETS were tracking her by her car so she decided she was going 
to trade it in and that's when something very interesting happened the mechanic told her as he 
was inspecting the car why did you take the door off she told him sir I have never taken it off 
uh but under hypnosis yeah she recall that the door had in fact been removed 
so although she did remember much of this experience in sort of as a dream she did 
go under hypnosis to fill out all the details that's quite an unusual case because she did get a lot of information now here's another case which was very widely publicized in Argentina 
and caused quite a sensation it occurred on December 15 1981 to a truck driver on the 
outskirts of San Luis Del Palmar in Argentina this case comes from researcher Eduardo Alfredo Lopez 
and the main witness that's 41 years old father of six and his name is Reuben Meneses 
and as he says in his own words I was driving home from work and thinking how wonderful that soon I 
would be with my family suddenly the night became day and I wondered how the Sun could be shining 
at such an hour for some reason I felt my skin crawl and my blood ran like ice water in my body 
something deep inside me was warning me of disaster soon to strike 
so it's still night time although there's it's so bright it's bright like days what he's describing 
he screeched the truck to a stop and this tingling sensation filled him and he watched 
as his truck with him in it rose up into the air as he says I saw cars and trucks passing 
by at high speed on the road I felt it in all my body like a tingling and I saw the cab and 
the whole truck wrapped in a very powerful white light that went through everything 
then I half faded although I never lost Consciousness for a moment I was suddenly inside 
a great ship with red green and blue flashing lights the walls were mirrored like shiny Steel 
I kept my eyes closed but yet I could see that I was floating lying face down but suspended in 
the air I began to have terrible thoughts that I'd gone mad or that I would soon be murdered 
he apparently opened his eyes at this point because as he says then I saw the space creatures 
they were standing around me little man-like people about three feet tall their skin was 
pale green and very wrinkled they had a very small forehead and thin arms that reach almost 
to their feet I only have a dim recollection that they talked to me ask me questions and 
that I answered them I didn't move my lips but we talked with our minds I saw mental images 
I pray to God that he will be merciful and let me know what happened what they did to me 
the torment of not knowing is more than I can bear next thing he remembers is he was 
55 miles from his original location now near the town of Paso to La Patria near Veron de Estrada 
so he was deeply traumatized he was rushed to doctors and as one of his doctors says 
he seems not to be a helpless mixture of child and man he cries all the time sobbing 
like a little child it will take much time and patience before he will be a man again 
the possibility is great that he may never recover from his incredible experience so yeah 
he was very traumatized in fact his physician Dr Alberto Vidal also examined him and says 
I have never seen anybody in his State of Mind he must have had the most terrible experience 
that can be imagined he cried like a boy the poor man is quite bad with fear anguish and 
a nervous state that almost does not allow him to speak this man had a tremendous experience 
he is having a total nervous breakdown the only thing he has left is a reddish stripe in his eyes 
which is now dissipating which practically didn't let him see light for several days 
he still wears glasses today even inside the house because the light bothers him a lot this is one of 
the most common physiological reactions people have with a UFO encounter is eye irritation but 
yeah this case did receive a lot of attention in fact it was researched by government investigators 
who after examining rubin's truck saw that it showed signs of being exposed to a very 
high heat source and so did soil samples in the area and as investigator Pedro varacia says the 
soil had been turned to Glass by temperatures of 1500 to 1600 degrees so yeah quite a dramatic case
this next case is also very interesting this took place near Shrewsbury England 
in 1983 there are three Witnesses this is a multiple witness case 
these three Witnesses were having a good time at Tiffany's disco in Shrewsbury England and it was 
late in the evening when they decided to return home along the A5 Road and Shropshire England 
it was right outside the location of the Shamrock Cafe right next to Rican Hill this is near the 
small town of Achim that's something very strange happened to them so the three Witnesses are Viv 
Hayward and rosemary Hawkins both 27 years old and Valerie Walters age 26. and they believe 
it was around 2 A.M and it was Rosemary who first noticed these strange hovering lights 
and I'll just quote Rosemary directly and she says I opened the car window to get a better look the 
lights became blinding there was no noise became obvious we were looking at a flying saucer a UFO 
it followed us along the road we were very frightened Viv tried putting her foot down on the 
accelerator but it was as if the brakes were on then the lights dimmed and the craft disappeared 
we were so excited we drove straight to the Telford police station 
and as they got there it was then that they realized that they were missing time at least 20 minutes and they were put in touch with a UFO researcher and lawyer by the name of Harold Harris 
and he realized that this was a genuine case and he encouraged the woman to use hypnosis to recover 
their memories of the missing time which they agreed to do so they were separated the hypnosis 
session was conducted by Dr Joseph Jaffe and a couple of others and each three women were 
interviewed and hypnotized separately and recalled being taken on board and did recall very similar 
events as Rosemary says first she recalled seeing the bright lights and then as she says 
under hypnosis we are so frightened the lights are attached to a spacecraft of some kind 
I am floating and I'm not in the car anymore with Viv and Val I feel big and Bloated 
it is a semi-circular room I'm on a bed in the room like a long table on a stand 
there's something coming I can hear them something in the room it's metal it sort of re rolls on 
wheels it's about four feet tall round on top with a round body and roundish legs looking at me 
there's more coming there are four they are around me she could not see any faces but she saw their 
heads moving up and down and then she says that's how I know they are talking about me they don't 
seem to be nasty they just want to have a look I feel so relaxed and they feel friendly I like them 
that's what Rosemary recalled now here's what Viv recalls this is Viv talking in her own words 
I feel I'm floating I'm being drawn up the car is being taken up I can't see the road anymore 
I see a white cloud I'm on my own I can see the door of the UFO opening it is round I'm 
looking through the car windscreen the car roof is going in first it's like two big doors opening 
it's made of steel now inside the craft she saw what appeared to be windows and lights and a 
bunch of kind of computers and TVs type screens as she says I can feel these aliens holding me down 
they seem as though they have taken me out of the car I'm in a chair they're holding me down they feel very strong they're trying to find out things from me they want to know how we're made 
it feels as if they are taking something from my body my legs there's a lot of pain in my legs 
they're putting their hands inside my legs and pulling my bones they're telling me not to be 
frightened somebody in charge is talking to me they have scanned me my top half and then the rest 
of my body they are four feet tall they have no hair they're ugly they have a strange looking nose 
thin arms they can't see their legs but they're dressed in a green cloak they look like men
so that's what Viv recalled and Valerie has a very similar story as she says I can see lights it's 
hovering and gliding towards us there's a bright light in my head I feel big and clumsy I'm walking 
down the road looking for Rosemary somebody has touched me on my shoulder somebody's carrying me 
I can feel them but I can't see them I hear voices they seem to be telling me don't be afraid 
so she looks around her and she sees a male and a female figure she believes dressed in a green robe 
which is what vivre called and as Valerie says the woman was fascinated by my shoes 
she took them off me and tried walking in them she had bare feet the creatures kept feeling my 
clothes in my hair I wasn't afraid of them but was frightened of what was happening 
so that's what they recalled the next thing they know all three were placed back in their car 
and I'll just let Rosemary describe this process that she says I am floating again I can see the car everything has gone black I'm in the car now Val and Viv are 
there with me viv's got her foot down hard on the accelerator we are trying to get away from it and 
Viv we called the same thing all she says is they carry me to my car the car is back on the road 
so after recalling this all three women are of course convinced that they shared an onboard UFO experience and as Rosemary says we are not cranks we never intended it to go this far we 
thought it was all over two years ago but when we were told there was 20 minutes of Our Lives missing it was natural that we should want to find out what happened since the aliens were waiting 
for us three because we are so different in our personality and outlooks I know people may laugh 
but we know what happened and we're telling the truth that night will live with me for the rest 
of my life I know what happened that night and the memory will live with me until the day I die 
Valerie agrees and she says I know from what happened to me that beings from another planet 
have been here and I'm proud they chose me to visit so this was widely researched by not only 
researchers the police as well because they went to the police and as police chief Norman 
Collinson says it certainly isn't a hoax I am perfectly satisfied that this is not a hoax 
one of the researchers Michael Sachs says this case must be the most convincing that has ever 
emerged the most astounding things the time Factor these women may never have discovered what they'd 
been through if they had failed to notice the missing 20 minutes there's certainly no way the 
three women could have collaborated before they went under hypnosis I think there's absolutely 
no reason to disbelieve the woman's evidence all the signs show under hypnosis were typical of them 
going through a traumatic experience I doubt if we'll see anything like it again and researcher 
Harold Harris who also investigated the case agrees as he says I have no doubt this UFO existed 
it was a nuts and bolts craft of Unknown Origin these women were hypnotized individually and there 
was no collusion yet they describe similar things this is a unique case this case will provide vital 
evidence for us I'm sure these women here have met alien beings and they're telling the truth 
I'm certainly convinced that everything these ladies said happened actually did happen 
so yeah a very interesting multi-witness case I just have two more I'd like to cover if here's 
a very interesting case which apparently took place in India near the Ganges River this is in 
Bihar India this case only comes from one source so it's not super well verified but I included 
here for what it's worth yeah 1985 the main witness is a 17 year old girl named indu Shah 
this case was leaked out and apparently was never supposed to become public but according to the report on this case Hindu was found wandering dazed and disoriented by a 
local farmer he noticed that she had some what looked like burned patches on her skin she'd 
been missing for three days but had no memory of this she was immediately taken into Medical Care 
and knowing that she had been missing under unusual circumstances and seeing these marks 
on her body they tested her for radioactivity and it came out positive and so in an attempt to 
find out what happened during this missing time they injected her with sodium pentathol and she 
recalled walking through a field when a silver saucer hovered overhead and beamed her on board 
she said two dwarf-like figures said that no harm would come to her and she was placed in a glass 
Booth while a weird machine was lowered over her body from head to foot so this appeared to be some 
kind of examination that's all she really recalls the next thing she knows she was near the location 
where she had been taken and again this whole story was allegedly covered up until a classified 
document was leaked by a disgruntled high-ranking officials in the Indian Ministry of Health 
so it's an unusual case but again shows that this is a worldwide phenomena 
and now we get to the last final case which is also quite interesting a multi-witness case which 
took place near kadore in the Italian Alps this took place on August 15 1986
now the main Witnesses are a husband and wife by the name of Angelo and grazia Ricci they were 
on vacation and were picnicking in the forest on the edge of a forest when this incident happened 
and as Angelo says in his own words we were sitting at the edge of the woods when we noticed 
an extraordinary light descending rapidly towards us we saw it was a luminous white disk about 30 
feet in diameter it landed almost in front of us only a few yards away without making the slightest 
sound we were dumbfounded so this was about 1am when they saw this disc land they watched it for 
about 10 minutes and when it left they looked at their watch and they not saw that it read 3 A.M 
so they had missing time and as Angelo says I was stunned grazia and I had no re-election of 
anything during those two hours that we both felt exhausted and were thoroughly confused 
and looking at the site where this craft had landed they did see crushed and burned grass 
now grazia just earlier had read about recent sightings in this exact area 
so they started to do their research they knew the writer of the article was Antonio shumienta 
Antonio miento is a very well-known Italian investigator so they contacted him and he began 
an investigation he had been placed under hypnosis and no surprise an on-board encounter emerged 
and I'll just quote grazia extensively because she describes very well what happened to her as she says two human-like shapes approached us there were at least 
seven feet tall and clad in some kind of gray fabric jumpsuits that covered all but their heads 
their heads were elongated and their faces were oval and very pale they had no hair 
their eyes glowed just like phosphorus make it making it almost impossible to look at them 
their ears were close to their heads and pointed they appeared to have normal noses the creatures 
had a slit where their mouth would be they walked towards us and picked us up each carrying one of 
us in his arms we were completely limp with no control over our muscles or movements 
yet my mind was functioning and alert and I felt aware of everything 
a feeling of Terror swept over me and as though the being sensed it or even knew it from inside 
my brain I could feel the being talked to me to calm me down if there were no words spoken it was 
as though this creature could communicate without saying anything so grazia is describing telepathy 
here it's apparent she's not familiar with it but as she says the being didn't seem menacing 
after that and I was filled with wonder and awe at what was happening They carried us inside 
into what seemed to be a large laboratory Pure White and full of strange instruments and gadgets 
batteries of little colored lights glowed and blinked in the panels around the wall 
were placed on reclining chairs like those dentists use but more advanced in design with 
buttons and lights built into the sides and they began to perform some kind of test on us 
they swung down various devices from overhead and positioned them above our faces and bodies 
I was filled with Dread but then I realized that nothing they were doing hurt at all 
I have no idea if they scanned our minds or took any fluids or injected anything there were no 
marks or bruises they simply pointed things at us and studied whatever it was their instruments told 
them about us this lasted perhaps an hour maybe longer I lost all sense of time they seem to know 
exactly what we were feeling and thinking the two beings never spoke to each other but I got the 
idea they were communicating and comparing notes in some way we could not understand 
so after being examined the next thing grazia recalls is these instruments sliding back into 
the ceiling and both she and her husband were carried off the ship and placed into the exact 
spot and position they had been sitting now she has no memory of this craft even taking off 
following this they were physically fine though they did have some anxiety and Nightmares and 
researcher Antonio Gio miento learned that there were four other sightings that night in that area 
he also went to the site and saw the samples of or saw the crushed and burned grass and 
took samples of it and he was absolutely convinced of the veracity of this case 
and as he says in my 10 years of UFO research I have never been involved in so explicit a 
case of alien contact is that of the Richies the Richies told me they used to ridicule UFO reports 
they never believed a word of them their encounter has left them badly shaken and no longer in doubt 
the incident has convinced them that super intelligent life forms are out there and 
that they know who we humans are I am totally convinced that the Richies are telling the truth 
I haven't the slightest doubt they really did experience a close encounter of the Third Kind 
I think you'll agree those are definitely astonishing cases and there's so many of them the 
10 I present here are as you know just the tip of the iceberg many people believe many investigators 
believe that there are probably millions of cases not hundreds of thousands millions 
so it's vastly under reported we know this most people do not report their encounters 
especially if it involves an onboard encounter or face-to-face encounter with ETS sightings 
yes but more than that it's rarely reported and again as you can see coming from all over the 
world stretching back many decades still going on currently this is a very important subject 
that's why I want to do these videos because I think if everyone knew these things happen it would change our Behavior we change the way we look at each other at our place in this universe 
and I like these cases because they show some really remarkable patterns as you can see the 
most common thing people report when being taken on board a UFO is being physically examined 
Grays are quite common though certainly not the only type of ET but they're all humanoids arms and legs that sort of thing I find that quite interesting 
also interesting is how many many people report being taken while they're driving 
and quite a few of these cases they're not only taken while driving but the car itself is 
lifted up into the craft this shows how truly astonishingly Advanced the technology of the 
ETS are and I really love the cases involving long conversations where the people are given 
information about why the ETS are here so yeah very interesting as you can see there's a lot 
of fear with some of these cases though in most of these cases as I found out in my own research 
people feel that this was not necessarily A malevolent experience although scary 
um some people actually thought it was a good thing for them a benevolent experience 
so that's an important factor I think at any rate I really hope you enjoyed this episode 
I truly thank you for watching and I really appreciate it until next time keep looking 
for answers keep searching for the truth and most important keep having fun bye for now.
