ET HEART HEALINGS

Summary:
Feb 11, 2022
According to The Center for Disease Control and The World Health Organization, the leading cause of death in the world is heart disease. In fact, about one in four deaths are attributable to some form of heart disease. Since physical healings are a consistent feature of UFO encounters, it should come as no surprise that there are many cases of people who have been healed of heart disease by extraterrestrials.

This video presents more than a dozen cases of people healed of various heart conditions. The cases reach back decades and are still occurring today. Men, women and children all over the world are being visited and healed. 

--A young girl from California has an ET dream and wakes up to find herself healed of an enlarged heart.
--A man from Russia is invited aboard a UFO and is healed of a chronic heart condition by tall human-looking aliens.
--A man born with a hole in his heart receives numerous psychic healings from a gray alien by the name of Mazu.
--A man from Puerto Rico is visited by three short humanoids who tell him is sick, and quickly proceed to heal him of heart disease.
--A woman from Ukraine dying from heart disease is visited in her hospital room by a glowing entity who heals her using orbs of light.
--A real-estate agent from Oregon is struck by lightning, then abducted by grays who tell her that her heart has been damaged, and they will fix it.
--A professor from Pennsylvania is visiting the Isle of Iona, is struck by a beam of light and experiences missing time. Later hypnotized by Dr. John Mack MD, he recalls being healed by a short reptilian humanoid of arterial sclerosis.

These are just a few of the many cases of people who claim to have been healed by extraterrestrials of a wide variety of heart conditions. These accounts show a benevolent side of UFO contact that is often ignored. They show that healing humanity is a primary ET agenda. They also show just how truly advanced the ETs are.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the 
paranormal I call this episode et heart healings according to the center for disease control 
and the world health organization heart disease is the single leading cause of death on this planet 
in fact nearly a million people die each year and one in four deaths on earth are directly attributable to some form of heart disease 
so this is a huge problem and it should come as no surprise that there are quite a few cases in which 
people claim to have been healed of their heart disease by extraterrestrials so that's what this 
episode is about today I think these cases are not only interesting but very important because 
they show a benevolent side to et contact that is often overlooked it shows how these cases 
are universal coming from all across the world et's display no prejudice on who they're healing 
the healings occur to men women and children these cases also show how truly advanced the ets are 
and reinforces their agenda of healing so that's why I wanted to do this video today I have nearly 
a dozen cases of et heart healings and they stretch some years back in time all the way 
to the present day and the first case I'd like to talk about comes from a researcher by the name of 
lynnisa who is part of the UFO organization called the UFOCCI and she reports a very interesting 
heart healing case that comes from los angeles california and I'll just quote lynisa directly 
as she says a lady that lives in los angeles told about an experience she had when she was 12 
years old this is around the 1960s as lanisa says she was born with a congenital heart defect 
one side of her heart was huge and the other small her brother had died from the same condition 
the doctors insisted she have open heart surgery to correct the condition 
and one night she had a dream that a man came to her and did something to her chest 
to the point that she felt like he was crushing her next morning she woke up with such pain 
she was rushed to the hospital but when she was x-rayed the heart was healed and totally normal 
so while it's hard to say that this is actually a e.t doing this she later had 
some confirmation that it probably was because she went some years later to the chiropractor 
who found surgical scars on her body so she had been operated on the chiropractor was certain of 
it however the witness said she had never been to the hospital for surgery and that's just one case 
there are many others a second case comes from a very famous russian UFO contactee by the name 
of victor kostroykin victor became interested in UFOs in august of 1962 when he saw a UFO 
over the caucasus mountain range in russia it impressed him enough that he started bringing 
groups of people to this area specifically to view UFOs and discourage that people were not 
taking these UFOs seriously he began going out on his own and trying to call them down 
and he was remarkably successful and in fact had direct contact on the evening of july 7 1968 he 
was hiking near the shigen gorge this is an area of high UFO activity in russia when he saw a very 
bright unidentified flying object descend near a hill and it quickly ran to this area 
and saw a large disk landed on the ground and next to it there was a figure very tall dressed 
in silver overalls and it was gesturing for victor to approach and enter the craft which he did 
and inside victor saw advanced computer like equipment he said and furniture that was melded 
directly with the walls and floor he saw other humanoid figures aboard the craft 
each of them very much similar to each other so much like that they looked like twins even which 
is commonly reported among contactees and at one point during this long and complicated encounter 
victor was approached by a figure wearing a strange pair of elbow length black gloves 
and this figure proceeded to thrust his gloved hand directly into victor's chest right through 
his shirt and skin and everything and as victor says I did not feel any pain or other sensations 
at least not at first at some point victor felt this hand reach the area of his heart 
and at this point he did start to feel a strange pain and he screamed this figure withdrew his hand 
and victor says that he experienced many other bizarre episodes during this experience and then 
was finally released from this object he was now several miles from where he had been picked up 
what's very interesting about this case and significant here is before this encounter victor 
costroykin was suffering from a heart defect a congenital heart defect that he'd lived with his 
entire life however following this experience he was healed his heart defect was no longer there 
and he did report a number of other changes after the encounter he had several instances of what he 
believes is telepathy it was so pronounced that he had difficulty being in crowds 
he also experienced other paranormal phenomena such as telekinesis precognition of disasters 
and also felt that he had gained the ability to heal other people himself 
this is a very common symptom of UFO contact it's quite an interesting case 
and now we move to yet another case and there's there are quite a few of them it's really remarkable another case comes from UFO researcher barbara lamb a well-respected researcher who has 
counseled and interviewed hundreds if not thousands of UFO contactees 
and one of them was a very interesting gentleman who she calls harold and throughout his life 
harold had dreams about aliens and experienced occasional episodes of missing time however 
it wasn't until his late 40s that he realized he was having e.t contact this is when he 
reached out to barbara lamb and with the use of hypnotic regression recalled a lifetime of contact 
including a series of healings on his heart which apparently began prior to his birth while he was 
still in the womb of his mother as barbara lamb writes and I quote while his mother was asleep 
one night she was visited by a gray male being who placed his hands on her abdomen in the area of her 
womb where harold was developing the being said directly to him that his heart was defective 
and that there was a hole in one chamber that would make it impossible for to him to live after he was born this being also indicated that he was placing an invisible 
electromagnetic strip over the defect in harold's heart in order that he would survive 
the electromagnetic strip would be reinforced by him after harold was born to keep his heart 
working properly and this is exactly what happened so this is something harold recalled in his 40s 
and uh under hypnosis he recalled being visited again when he was three years old he recalled 
being actually taken on board placed on a table and examined by this e.t who called himself mazu 
and this was the same being who had originally healed him in utero and as barbara lam writes 
on this occasion mazou placed his hand over the little boy's chest apparently reinforcing 
the electromagnetic strip so under hypnotic regression harold learned that he had been 
abducted many times throughout his life throughout the 1960s and 1970s and during each experience 
this et by the name of mazu would place his hands over harold's chest to reinforce this energetic 
healing strip and this was not the only thing that happened during harold's contact 
harold was also taught on a variety of topics including how to pilot the UFO ships 
how to meditate how to perform telekinesis and other things like this 
when harold reached the age of 48 he had a contact experience with mizzou and mizzou told him that he 
needed to go visit a heart surgeon on earth and undergo surgery to repair the hole in his heart 
so he followed mazou's guidance and underwent heart surgery he went to the heart doctors who 
were shocked because they could not believe harold was still alive and had this very pronounced hole 
in his heart harold's wife was a registered nurse actually observed the operation 
and as barbara lam writes she clearly observed the shock and confusion of the doctors upon 
viewing the silver dollar-sized hole in his heart they estimated it had been there for many years 
but for some inexplicable reason it leaked very little blood at the time of the surgery 
the entire medical staff was amazed that harold was alive so there you go another heart healing 
and here's yet another which comes from UFO researcher alberto alberto rosales 
who wrote the multi-volume set humanoids amongst us and this is a really interesting case because 
it involves a gentleman who was healed of a heart condition and his wife is also present was also 
cured uh this occurred in 1977 the witness's name is bernardo vega and he was undergoing treatment 
for his chronic cardiac problems at the hospital oncological duponts in ensenada puerto rico 
and on the evening of december 22 1977 bernardo vega was at his home caring for his wife 
who was very sick from the flu apparently she had been vomiting all evening and was quite weak and 
during this evening bernarro stepped outside to clean out the bowl that his wife had been using 
and as he washed this bowl he saw three bright lights approaching he first thought 
they were fireflies until they grew close and he saw that they were quite large very bright 
and he fell to his knees in shock and fear as these lights descended directly onto his terrace 
right in front of him and transformed into three human figures three males he says they were 
neither ugly nor pretty they were about three feet tall with short arms and legs and large hands he 
says their faces were large with a big flat nose thick lips and glowing eyes and they each wore 
blue diver's suits they began to speak to bernardo in an unknown language at a very fast pace 
and he says as they stared into his eyes he felt like they were reading his mind 
and one of these figures turned to the other two and said he is sick cure him at this point one of 
these men approached bernardo placed his fingers on his chest and said I am going to cure you 
he moved his hand around and bernardo saw flashing lights he felt nothing but he did 
begin to sweat profusely as he says it was as if someone had emptied a bucket of water on me 
his wife apparently uh heard this activity and shouted out who are you talking to 
and bernardo told her to just please wait something very important is happening 
and at this point the three men held each other's hands and told bernardo we need you 
goodbye and the men then transformed into three orbs of light and flew away 
the entire event lasted bernardo estimates about 25 minutes he ran inside and told his wife who was 
quite impressed he told his mother who was very religious and she thought it might have been an angelic visitation of some kind but following this experience bernardo visited his doctors at the 
hospital who were shocked to find that bernardo had been inexplicably cured not only was his heart 
normal but as they said he his heart was functioning like that of a young teenager 
and this appears to have been a double healing because after this event after these figures left 
bernardo's wife also very very quickly recovered and I was no longer ill 
so it's an interesting case to say the least and it's not the only one there are 
many many people who are experiencing these heart healings another comes from russia 
it occurred in 1985 to a lady by the name of marina luco nina and this also comes from albert 
alberto rosalie's and marina was a resident of obnix in the kaluga region of russia 
and she was in her home when she was approached by very tall figures seven foot tall aliens who said 
that they were from the constellation of libra this ship actually landed outside her home and 
marina says she wasn't abducted but was rather invited on board and they put her in this sort of 
arm chair and transported her to their planet which they called sarah they spoke to her telepathically they told her they lived about 400 years and on this 
other planet she said she met other et's some who were much taller than seven feet up to nine feet 
and the e.t said that they were going to cure her and they performed an energetic 
surgery she said and not only did they cure her of her heart disease they trained her how to do 
energetic healings herself on other people and she was returned to earth and she became very involved 
in non-traditional psychic healing and performed a number of quote bloodless surgical procedures 
telling her patients that these were the methods that she had been taught by the et's and apparently she was quite successful because she had a lot of patience 
and a number of positive testimonials attesting to the ability of her to heal 
so there's that same pattern again and again people are not only being healed 
but are being taught how to heal and another case comes from an anonymous person 
in the crimea area of ukraine this involved a woman who was terminally ill with heart disease 
and was in her hospital room at the curve hospital on the evening of april 18 1989 
her hospital room filled with a strong wind filled with a bright white light and this man 
dressed all in white appeared and he was glowing with white light his eyes actually radiated light 
and the patient asked this man who he was where he had come from and this figure said 
that he was from quote the 10th dimension and told this patient that she would soon be cured 
and then disappeared and the very next day outside witnesses observed unexplained red and white 
lights moving over the body of the patient in her hospital room and they heard a loud voice 
telling her to quote get up and leave and the woman rose from her hospital bed and she was no 
longer weak she was no longer struggling for her breath and in fact she was completely healthy this 
case was presented by russian researcher sergey bulantsev and it appeared in the UFO magazine 
ufo universe and also in alberto rosalie's book humanoids amongst us it's one of many cases in 
which people have been healed in a hospital room another very interesting case comes from 
a well-known contactee by the name of katarina wilson who wrote a book called the alien jigsaw 
she's had a lifetime of contact and also had a very interesting heart healing 
she was in florida when she was actually struck by lightning as it turns out your chances of being 
struck by lightning are very small in fact you're probably more likely to be abducted by aliens 
but in katarina's case she experienced both she was struck by lightning stumbled into her house 
and was going to call the hospital but before she could ets appeared and abducted her and told 
her flat out that she had been injured by this lightning strike and they would heal her so she 
was quite disoriented quite afraid she woke up on this UFO lying on this table and she was suffering 
from excruciating chest pains and as she watched gray type aliens cut a square into her chest 
and attached a black mechanism a tool-like device with several extensions to this hole in her chest 
and the pain was very intense and the et's told her we are repairing your heart you will be 
okay now and the next morning katarina woke up and her chest was quite sore but she felt otherwise 
fine and as she says and I quote the first thing I did when I got out of bed was to look for a scar 
of a square cut into my chest I found nothing no blood on my sheets and no scar my chest was sore 
throughout the day but it was not as sore as I would have expected it to feel after such a radical operation I believe this machine they had over my heart was realigning the electrochemical 
impulses in my heart because they had been altered by the lightning somehow I believe the aliens were 
repairing the damage the high voltage of the lightning had done to my heart katarina not 
only wrote the book the alien jigsaw and a couple of follow-up books she did appear on art bell's 
radio program where she talked about how ets had not only healed her but were healing other 
people and that ets are not something we should be afraid of although it can be quite frightening
another case comes from german researcher michael hesseman he's quite prominent in this field 
and this case occurred sometime in the 1980s the exact date is not given but it occurred 
to an anonymous factory worker in georgia russia who woke up with severe chest pains and 
shortness of breath he had recently suffered two consecutive heart attacks and he instantly 
recognized the symptoms of a third heart attack and he had been told that his chances of survival 
were not good if he were to have another heart episode so he was quite frightened and was 
getting ready to call the hospital hospital but before he could take any action he found himself 
surrounded by gray et's and the aliens took this ball of light and put it inside the man's chest 
and he was telepathically told that he was healed that they would like him to paint his experience 
while he was a factory worker he was apparently also an artist at this point the man fell asleep 
and when he woke up the next morning he felt no pain and was apparently healed 
and he immediately prepared to make a painting of these beings and following this experience 
he was perfectly healthy and was able to take daily marathon runs through 
gorky park and according to michael hesseman he has investigated several healing accounts 
in this particular area of russia and he says that unlike other areas where people fear ets 
in georgia russia people look at the ets as friends and are eager to be taken on board
one of my favorite cases of this kind comes from researcher john mack md who wrote the book 
abduction he was one of the first academics to write about UFOs and study the UFO abduction 
phenomena and had a very positive outlook on this subject and he interviewed a man by the name of 
edward carlos who was in fact healed edward carlos was a fine arts professor in pennsylvania and 
had UFO encounters his entire life and in fact in 1942 at age five edward carlos was healed 
of pneumonia by the et's but it was many years later on april 15 1990 and edward was visiting 
the island of iona between scotland and ireland when he saw this unexplained beam of light coming 
down from the clouds and this beam of light struck edward carlos and he experienced missing time so 
he had had this sort of experience before sometime he had missing time sometimes he remembered 
consciously being taken on board but unable to remember what happened during this missing time 
he went to visit john mack and underwent hypnotic regression and under hypnosis he 
recalled being examined by several entities including a reptilian like humanoid small 
white-skinned humanoids and an insect-like robotic creature he said he had the typical 
anal probe and the et's told him this was to uh determine the state of his health 
as edward carlos says quote they are clarifying that the inside of me is okay 
they are operating on me they are looking to see if anything is not right the process 
can be healing so the et's continued to examine edward carlos thoroughly including his heart 
and they said that his heart needed work apparently there was some blockages there 
they used this laser-like instrument to clear his arteries of blockage as edward carlos says 
they can cause the change with their laser-like instruments in my heart I feel extreme heat I 
think it is healing something clearing arteries or something uh carlos said that he has been healed 
more than once not only of pneumonia and apparently arterial sclerosis but a possible cancer cure he feels that his encounters are positive and transformative 
as he says you are diseased and then you are healed with each healing the emotional growth is 
established and connected in the human realm and I can go and utilize that toward teaching others
and here is another case which comes from the area of georgia russia specifically from the town of tibilisi and according to researcher helga moro 
there are many many healings taking place in this city and she had the opportunity to view a rare 
1993 UFO documentary from russia which presented many of these cases and as helga moro says and I 
quote after almost six hours of studying this film carefully I feel is the most outstanding 
first-hand information about extraterrestrials ever to be filmed anywhere in the world 
and apparently this film recounts several cases of people who were healed including this following brief report as helga morrow writes the shaven stomach of a man shows a slight scar 
he was permanently and painlessly cured of a heart condition and here's yet another case 
from russia and this occurred to a gentleman by the name of igor nikolayevich patukov and 
in the summer of 1998 igor who was a farmer from russia was working in the fields when he heard a 
strange sound coming from above him and this light came down it descended and landed behind his shed 
so he started to walk towards the shed when suddenly a small humanoid dressed in 
a tight-fitting black uniform flew up from behind the shed and approached igor and this farmer found 
himself unable to move the e.t hovered in front of him and he saw that it was a short figure with 
dark eyes a tiny little nose and a slit-like mouth this figure said nothing but flew up and down 
in front of igor he was afraid at first but it became clear to him that there was no harm being 
put towards him and this figure hovered in front of him for a full 15 minutes which is a long time 
and then flew off and the very next day he saw the same figure again walking around in the backyard 
and this figure looked directly at him but said nothing it returned again on a third day 
this time hovering above the porch and looking inside the house as if looking for igor 
and as soon as he saw this figure it flew away and was never seen again 
but following these three encounters igor who suffered from chronic heart disease said that 
he had experienced a dramatic improvement in his health and in fact it was so dramatic he 
went to the doctor and the doctor verified that his chronic heart disease was pretty much gone 
and this was also verified by igor's family who now could see that igor was healthy 
so there you go more and more cases here is yet another case which involves actually 
two healings a lady by the name of mary uh from ontario canada 
had suffered from a heart murmur her entire life this was a condition that ran 
in her family this case actually comes from canadian researcher grant cameron and
this lady mary not only suffered from a heart murmur she suffered from infertility and her 
doctors told her she would never be able to have children but that all changed on january 7 
2003 mary was traveling with a friend and a 12 year old child along a road in northern ontario 
when this UFO showed up it began when the they noticed that the highway around them was empty 
of any other vehicles and shortly after this they noticed that they were being paced by a not only 
one UFO two two UFOs were following them on either side of their car and the child was so frightened 
by this that she climbed out of the back seat and sat between the two adults in the front seat and 
these objects followed these three people for a half an hour and finally at some point fell back 
and uh turned on their lights raced forward and began buzzing the car at very low altitudes 
this frightened the three witnesses who quickly sped away leaving the UFOs behind now later mary 
would have other encounters and she was apparently healed because as grant cameron writes and I quote 
the woman who could not bear children just had her fifth child and the lifelong heart condition 
is a thing of the past so there are many cases here's yet another that I investigated personally 
involving a woman from maine I call her lynette she's had a lifelong series of encounters 
she was once healed of a lung condition she had a cyst in her lung and doctors were planning on removing one third of her lungs and that's when et's healed her 
but she also experienced a healing of her heart she was taken on board this was around 2011 and 
this gray showed up and said that she had a problem with her heart lynette was not aware of 
this and she could not believe what happened next and I'll just quote lynette directly as she says 
this e.t I quote plunged his hand into my chest like nothing was solid 
it hurt I could feel pain I first thought he had something in his hands but I don't know if he did 
or not I couldn't see I just saw the hand going in beyond the fingers almost to the thumb and I 
hurt I almost felt like I was burning and he said your heart is physically and spiritually healed
so there you go this is another case in which itches are healing people not with instruments 
necessarily as is in some cases but just by plunging their hands directly into a person's 
chest it's quite strange but apparently is a method that's used fairly regularly because 
as you have seen it's not the only one and there are others here's another case that's 
very similar this occurred to a gentleman who prefers to remain anonymous I'll call him steve 
and this was in manchester new jersey on june 9 2013 steve woke up suddenly he was a light sleeper 
and he often woke up in the middle of the night but on this particular occasion he was startled to 
see someone standing next to his bed someone that he described as a tall thin glowing white humanoid 
and as steve says and I quote with no sound the being reached into my left chest area I didn't 
feel any pain pressure or discomfort this lasted about five minutes the being removed its hand 
from my left chest and stood there for about two minutes and then vanished so steve was amazed and 
confused he was absolutely baffled as to what had just happened he'd never seen a UFO just this one 
humanoid and he felt physically fine but he really began to wonder why this e.t had plunged its hands 
into his chest and he began to have a very strong intuitive urge he said which was so overwhelming 
he went to a cardiologist and this was just a few months after this experience he went and 
got an ekg and a stress test and the doctors told him that they were absolutely shocked 
he had a very severe health condition and was actually lucky to still be alive they told him he 
had arrived at the hospital just in time they told him that he had been born with a bicuspid aorta 
valve when it should have been tricuspid and not only that not only did he have a heart defect 
he was suffering from severe congestive heart failure as stephen says so I was rushed to the 
hospital to prep me for a triple bypass and a replacement aorta valve the doctors joked to 
him that he was getting a two-for-one operation a bypass and a valve replacement and as steve says 
my take my feelings on this incident was the white light being made temporary repairs for me to not 
have a heart attack or stroke ahead of time it was a miracle this white light being made adjustments 
to give me the time and the strong intuition to get into a hospital to save my life so there you 
go more than a dozen cases of people who believe their heart was healed by extraterrestrials 
i love these cases because as I said they show a benevolent side to et contact I presented them in 
my book the healing power of UFOs 300 true cases and I think these cases reinforce the fact that 
healing is a major et agenda and they teach us quite a bit about the ets that they are friendly 
that they heal people all over the world that they're extremely advanced that their abilities 
to heal include conditions that we would consider chronic and what's really interesting is that 
they're not only technologically advanced but are apparently spiritually advanced because we see them healing using mind power or directly sticking their hands into a person's body 
somewhat akin to the manner of psychic healing we do here on earth so that may sound unusual 
but the cases are consistent in this regard and uh really interesting in that there are people 
of all types being healed all across the u.s and the world involving men women and children I think 
these cases are very important and show again that healing is a major part of et contact and that's 
why I wanted to do this episode for you today and I really want to thank you once again for 
watching I'm really appreciate it and until next time keep asking questions and keep having fun
you
