TOP TWENTY UFO HEALING CASES
Aug 8, 2020

Summary:
Aug 8, 2020
There are more than 300 UFO healing cases on record. Some cases, however, rise above the rest. 
This video presents 20 of the very best UFO healing cases. These well-documented accounts come 
from men and women across the world, and involve the healings of a wide variety of injuries, 
illnesses and diseases. Many of the cases have been verified by doctors and UFO researchers. 
These UFO healing events are important because they present hard physical evidence of 
extraterrestrial intervention in people's lives. They also have many things to teach us about 
these mysterious visitors to our planet. They show us that there is no such thing as a chronic 
or incurable disease. They also show a very positive side to ETs and their agenda on Earth.

If you would like to learn more about people who have been healed by UFOs, my book, "The Healing 
Power of UFOs: 300 True Accounts" is available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and this  week's episode is about people who've been healed  
by extraterrestrials uh there's a lot of cases  i've been studying this subject for decades i've  
documented some 300 cases one question  i'm often asked is what's the best case  
it's a difficult question to answer because there  are a lot of cases and each one is different but  
some definitely do rise above the rest and what  i'd like to do today is present what i think are  
the top 20 up most outstanding cases another  researcher might come up with a different list  
but this is the one i've come up with and i'm  going to start with number 20 and move all the way  
to the number one what i think is the best case  so let's just get started the case that i chose  
for number 20 comes from researcher raynero  hernandez perhaps best known for co-founding  
the free organization he's making a huge splash  in the field and he became involved because of a  
healing incident which occurred to his dog nina  this was on march 4th 2012 uh he and his wife  
were in their home with their dog nina who was  pretty old she's a jack russell terrier suffering  
from arthritis and heart disease and actually had  suffered what appears to be a cerebral hemorrhage  
she was mostly paralyzed they called the vet  and the veterinarian said yes this is probably  
what caused her paralysis there's not much we can  do but bring her in the next day well that evening  
ray's wife prayed real hard for a healing  and apparently got one uh because that night  
uh a small silver colored translucent metallic  object appeared in the corner of the living room  
uh rainer's wife saw this she called for  ray to come downstairs he finally did  
just in time to view what looked like a  sort of plasma energy being and uh there  
was a period of missing time disorientation  and uh suddenly the plasma being was gone  
and uh nina the dog was apparently cured uh  she was running around quote like a young puppy  
so before this she was not able to run or jump  and now she was running around the house very  
excited so it's a very interesting case it's not  the only case i have of an animal being healed  
what i like about it is animals can't fake  illness this was also viewed by two witnesses  
rey is an attorney a very good witness yeah it's  an excellent case okay the next one i'd like  
to talk about is number 19 and this occurred  to a gentleman by the name of michael carter  
he's a reverend a healer a speaker the author  of a number of books about ufos and religion  
he's a social rights activist and has worked very  hard against uh racism and was actually commended  
by president clinton for  his work so a great witness   uh in 2013 he was diagnosed with a blood clot in  his leg over a period of three days it swelled  
up very quickly and became extremely painful  he went to the doctor the doctor told him he  
should have come in much earlier because  this is a very very serious condition  
immediately put him on a whole cocktail of  medicine and blood thinners and so on and uh  
basically michael had to return to the doctor  uh at least once a week to monitor his condition  
it was during this time that he had a visitation  july 4th 2013 he had laid down and was gone to  
sleep woke up in the middle of the night to see a  figure standing at the foot of his bed uh michael  
had had encounters before with grays but this was  not a gray this was a human-looking e.t a nordic  
type as as michael says and i'm quoting he was  very big and muscular he wore one of those cobbles  
that monks wear back in renaissance times he had  long blonde hair shoulder length and was pale  
so at this point what happened is the  figure who was about seven feet tall   and glowing in a white aura put out his hand palm  forward and a blue light emitted from his palm  
and struck michael on the face and chest this  is interesting because most of the healings do  
involve light but a few involve what appears to be  mind power no instruments are used no technology  
and that's true in this case at any rate michael  lost consciousness and woke up in the morning  
instantly remembered what happened i  was very excited to tell his family   and as he got out of bed saw that his leg was  now normal both legs were the same size and i'll  
quote again he says my legs were the same size  the right was the same size as the left and not  
only was it the same size but the veins in my leg  looked like they had changed position like they  
had been re-rooted or something that's the best  way i can put it of course michael went to the  
doctor the doctor was stunned amazed asked how  it happened like most patients michael did not  
tell him about the et encounter and just said it  was apparently a miraculous healing and his doctor  
agreed so yeah i like this case because michael  is a great witness and i was verified by doctors
next case i'd like to talk about is number 18.  this comes from researcher constance clear it  
involves an abductee by the name of andrew from a  small town in texas who had been having encounters  
pretty much his whole life which he  remembered only under hypnotic regression  
he had an encounter in 1996 in which he was taken  on board and was given a medical examination  
and the et's pointed out that there was a strange   object in his kidney and asked him what it  was you know was that supposed to be there  
was it helpful to him and andrew explained that  no it was not helpful this is a kidney stone  
and in fact it was hurtful to him and so  the et's proceeded to remove it using this  
very strange device a sort of a box-like device  with a dome and uh when he was returned the kidney  
stone was gone so what i like about this case is  andrew actually drew the instrument that was used  
to cure him of the kidney stone he showed it  to constance clear who took it to a doctor  
the doctor recognized it instantly he said that's  what we call lithotripsy and went on to explain  
that we have portable and fixed units  which focus an ultrasonic wave which  
shatters the kidney stones and that we've  had this technology for over 10 years  
so yeah i mean that's another great case number  17. case comes from a witness by the name of  
john salter also goes by the name of john hunter  gray or hunter bear he's a native american  
he's a social rights and human rights activist  professor of indian studies at south dakota  
university and has won awards for his uh work in  social justice this is a pattern i see in some  
of the cases of people who who is being healed  and why we see a lot of social rights workers  
and police officers doctors teachers this sort  of thing that's certainly true in this case  
john hunter gray and his son on march 20 1988  were driving near richland center wisconsin  
and encountered a ufo had missing time later under  hypnosis they recalled being abducted by grays and  
examined they received injections it was a very  short clinical experience neither were frightened  
it was very much like a doctor's visit  but what's amazing about this case   is what happened afterwards now john hunter gray  was not suffering from any illness at the time  
but following this incident he counted over 18  dramatic physiological improvements he had what  
amounts to a health upgrade that's the best way  i can put it there's a number of cases like this  
first difference he noticed was he no longer  had the urge to smoke he had been a very heavy  
smoker and he immediately stopped smoking  but there were other improvements including  
improved skin tone his skin became much  more elastic he his circulation improved  
his eyesight improved he had faster clotting past  her blood clotting after cuts and scratches his  
fingers and toenails and hair started growing  much more rapidly his face wrinkles disappeared  
some scars disappeared and others are fading  he lost weight his energy level went way up  
he stopped having yearly colds or flus so his  immunity was heightened his age spots disappeared  
and most amazing his arms legs stomach and chest  started growing a thick layer of hair which before  
had been hairless and also this is amazing to  me because he's you know in middle age at this  
point he grew two inches in height and his feet  grew several sizes so yeah it's an amazing case  
in which his health was improved and very  noticeable to all the people who knew him  
uh i like this case because uh yeah he's a great  witness and his son was also there and witnessed  
this his son also improved uh experienced several  improvements physiologically just not quite to the  
degree of his father here's another case which is  just amazing it was originally investigated by dr  
joseph burks md as part of the free project  founded by raynero hernandez co-founded i  
was a part of this study on ufo healings and so  was dr joseph burks who interviewed a gentleman  
by the name of alberto alberto was originally  from cuba but emigrated to the united states  
to florida where he became a police officer and  later worked for the government uh worked for the  
dea the drug enforcement agency so a  really good professional reputable witness  
who had been having experiences with  gray ets for most of his life in 2001  
alberto suffered a severe fall he was 56 years old  and actually fractured the orbit of his right eye  
this caused his cornea to become pretty badly torn  and he went to the doctor and got diagnosed and  
they treated him as best as they could and told  him that he needed to remain home alberto did  
not obey the doctor's advice he had just bought  tickets for a cruise which they were about to go  
on and he figured he would be fine and went on the  cruise anyway against his doctor's advice turned  
out to be a huge mistake because his condition  worsened and he began to lose his eyesight  
so he went to the doctor on board the ship  the doctor on board the ship was horrified and  
wanted to actually call in a helicopter to have  alberto helicoptered out to an emergency room  
for emergency treatment because he was afraid  that alberto would permanently lose his sight  
the cruise was about to end so alberto just waited  and went home and that evening he was visited  
in his room by an entity who did not get a good  view at but what he did see was this strange green  
light being flashed repeatedly into his eye and  he uh at some point lost consciousness when he  
woke up his vision was perfect went to the doctor  the doctor was absolutely astounded there was no  
trace of his injury whatsoever so yeah another  great case which i love because multiple people  
had witnessed this injury it was diagnosed both  before and after and the witnesses of outstanding  
credibility and the case itself was investigated  by a doctor dr burks so yeah another great case  
and they get better here's number 15 uh comes  from timothy good a great researcher from the uk  
this is a very early case i like the early cases  because they were relatively unknown and i think  
most people don't even know about this case this  occurred on october 2nd 1955 at desert center  
california a small group of people had  been going out to this area for the past  
year to view ufos and had successfully done so  they were having little ufo stakeouts and these  
objects would show up and this particular  incident yeah occurred on october 2nd  
the main witnesses were carl and stella anderson  and their friend jim stewart and they were at  
their campsite in desert center california when  a ufo showed up it was a typical metallic saucer  
very large came very low about 200 feet overhead  portholes little lights all around it your sort  
of classic disc and came so close it actually  frightened stella anderson quite a bit at which  
point the ufo seemed to sense that and rose up  higher and backed off so she went off into the  
distance while jim stewart was very intrigued  and wanted this ufo to land so he took a flare  
and signaled this object with the flare he lit  it up and this object comes swooping back down  
unfortunately jim was not being careful and burned  his hand very badly on on the flare with the flare  
and at this point the ufo flashed a very bright  color at him perhaps beamed him with a light  
at any rate instantly this burn was healed in  literally seconds so yeah i mean this is an  
amazing case what i like about this one is it was  viewed by three people and the main witness jim  
stewart actually left an affidavit testifying  to the veracity of this case and i'll quote it  
this is jim jim stewart talking this is to certify  that i james r stewart did on or about the second  
day of october in the year of 1955 witness a huge  object hovering above me on the california desert  
in a remote spot south of victorville i also had  the uncanny experience of having a severe burn  
which i had suffered from a burning flare  miraculously healed as this object changed color  
so yeah a sworn affidavit when someone's willing  to go on the line put their reputation on the  
line testifying to the veracity of their  case that to me adds credibility to it  
uh here's another case which i love because again  it's a very early case comes from a very prominent  
researcher dr david jacobs phd and uh involves  a lady by the name of alice haggerty who as a  
very young girl was suffering from diphtheria  her doctor was there um this had been diagnosed  
and her alice's condition unfortunately was  just getting worse and worse and the doctor  
suspected that she would not survive  the night he was there at her home   uh that evening alice was visited by tall  figures wearing robes and silver belts  
she was in a kind of a white round room  there was lots of panels and instrumentation  
and technology there she was placed into a clear  glass-like cylinder which shined a blue light  
down on her figures told her that she had  been healed and cleansed and returned her  
to her bedroom that morning her parents and the  doctor came in and found alice perfectly healthy  
yeah great case what i like about it is  again it's verified by doctors and you  
can't fake you know the healing of diphtheria  which analysis case appeared to be chronic  
uh perhaps fatal so yeah these this these cases  provide i think great evidence for ufo validity  
here's anoth another excellent case which comes  from researcher wendell stevens and originally  
from the researcher rodolfo casaleto they wrote  a book together about the case called the ufo  
contact from beautiful so this case took place in  1984 in brazil botouca 2 brazil it's and it's an  
amazing case unique i think in some ways uh  involves the witness was a young boy named zhao  
vicente who had suffered a cerebral aneurysm which  left him totally paralyzed and perhaps brain dead  
doctors had pretty much given up hope and uh the  boy was only being kept alive on life support and  
they were planning on removing it but it turns out  that the hospital doorman was a ufo contactee his  
name was jealous valerio and he was well loved in  the community and everyone knew he was a contactee  
and so the doctors at the hospital asked  zhao if he could get medicine from the ets  
and valerio said he would try when he had his next  encounter and that's exactly what happened he had  
an encounter he met the et's and asked if they  could heal gia vicente and they said yes and gave  
valerio two samples of medicine and  told him that the medicine should be  
applied topically to the boy's skin rubbed  onto his skin and that the boy would recover  
so that's exactly what happened the samples of  medicine were applied to the boy and he recovered  
and i'm going to quote rodolfo castelleto  here he's the main investigator of the case  
here's what he said x-rays are showing now that  a new nervous system is taking over the older  
one destroyed new arteries and the damaged  organs are being encapsulated by new tissue  
tissue all shown in the x-rays the doctors  call it quote a miracle i saw jealous vicente  
and he shook my hand and spoke some words  and is getting better so yeah it's another  
case where someone's scared of a chronic fatal  condition what makes the ad verified by doctors  
so what's truly amazing about this case is the  medicine samples were actually saved and put under  
analysis now the first medicine was reportedly  in soft crystal form about the size and color of  
raw sugar had to be kept away from heat because  they melted at about 115 degrees fahrenheit  
and when rubbed on the palms of one's hands  dissolved into a greasy substance and either  
evaporated or were absorbed the other  sample was an irregular granular material  
very fine about three millimeters across and uh  looked like small crushed shards semi-transparent  
of a reddish-brown color very much like shattered  garnet stones so one of these samples was given a  
extensive chemical analysis and unfortunately  they were not able to identify it as  
any substance organic or inorganic they could  not tell what it was and after running several  
uh various tests on it the only conclusion that  they could come up with was that this was quote  
chemically unique so yeah cases just get  better and better here's case number 12.  
uh this comes from a ufo researcher  hans lauritzen who had contracted  
liver hepatitis while traveling in africa  and became very ill his liver swelled up to  
nearly 50 percent its normal size he was so sick  that he could not run or exert himself he was very  
weak this condition was considered chronic and uh  he was suffering very badly from it for some time  
in 1967 he was participating on a ufo stakeout  with a bunch of ufo researchers a small group  
in denmark and they were successful these  two glowing objects came swooping down  
uh not too far from the group they all saw it  uh what's very interesting is suddenly the group  
uh was not able to move and han zlorzin was pulled  forward to these objects and had a long telepathic  
communication with him and they told him that he  would be of great help to humanity and that they  
would heal him which they did right there in full  view of everybody and uh they the objects then  
departed and hans lordson felt immediately better  and ran back towards the group and kept on running  
because he hadn't been able to run for a long time  he was super excited went straight to his doctor  
and the doctors were astounded because  now his he was healed and i'll quote hans  
lordson he says the blood test showed that  it functioned now as any other healthy liver  
before i had a sick liver at one time it was  as much as 16 centimeters too large now i have  
a healthy liver i am most thankful to the ufo for  curing my otherwise chronic disease i swear to god  
that i have told the truth as far as i can see it  so yeah another great case by a reputable witness  
witnessed by other people with before and after  doctor diagnosis hard to deny cases like these  
yeah i think the chronic cases that really  impressed me here's another case case number  
11 comes from researcher edith fiori phd the first  person with a phd actually to write a book about  
ufo abductions she was one of her clients was a  man by the name of ted and uh from santa clara  
who at age three was suffering from a chronic  condition known as angioma angioma is a  
malformation of the blood vessels in the brain  and it can be very severe and it was in ted's case  
it was causing loss of vision loss of speech the  inability to move doctors did not expect that  
ted would survive when suddenly he miraculously  recovered ted even though he was three years old  
remembered what happened he remembered little  grays came in sawed off the top of his head  
and fixed him with lasers and that's what he told  his parents he said little men came and saw the  
top of his head off and fixed him and his parents  were astounded because now he was suddenly better  
he had been having regular doctor visits they  took him back to the doctors who were also   just amazed and actually ordered  exploratory brain surgery  
and found that ted's condition had completely  reversed itself which they were unable to explain  
uh so moving on case number 10 top 10 case i  think it is uh the case of jim schaefer from  
winnipeg canada uh i interviewed him as part of  the free project uh with raynero hernandez and uh  
jim shafer's case is amazing he's worked with a  number of other prominent researchers he's got a  
lot of evidence to support his case photographs of  orbs and ufos sound recordings he's often returned  
with injuries as a result of his encounters which  are pretty much entirely shrouded in missing time  
so he doesn't remember a lot of  what's happened to him but he's   comes back with all kinds of medical evidence as  a young child he was returned home his eyes were  
very badly burned they rushed him to the emergency  room and he was diagnosed with burns to his eyes  
similar to welder's burns of course he had  not been welding so that was hard to explain  
but yeah he's returned with cuts incisions  bruises puncture wounds once he was returned  
to his home with a broken foot he always goes  to the doctors with with these injuries tells  
his doctor exactly what's happening to him  uh that he thinks he's being abducted by ets  
so the doctor does know his medical history of ufo  encounters so what happened in uh jim's case is in  
2015 he had a chronic sore throat and swollen  lymph glands that was not getting bad better went  
to the doctor his blood test showed that he had an  extremely high white blood cell count that was not  
good news went to a specialist and received  a devastating diagnosis that he had cancer  
uh he had a tumor in his lymph nodes on his  neck the doctors told him this is what the   biopsy showed that it was a malignant tumor and  he was having a lot of pain there was necrosis  
in the tissues surrounding this tumor so he had to  have surgery which was scheduled for three weeks  
after diagnosis uh on march 13 2015 he  was going to have surgery and it was  
about a week later that uh he had a very strange  experience by this time the tumor was growing  
so rapidly it was protruding from his neck and  on march uh mid-march 2015 jim was laying in bed  
uh he had been filming all these orbs that were  zipping around his house so this is something he  
had gotten in the habit of doing each night and  that's true this night he was lying there in bed  
filming when this orb comes zooming into  his house through his uh bedroom door  
directly towards him and go down into his  abdomen right into his body so he films this  
and was pretty astounded by it shortly later  he went to bed woke up the next morning and  
had the biggest shock of his life because when  he went into the bathroom looked in the mirror  
he saw that his tumor was gone that had been  excised out of his neck and i'll quote him here  
says jim shaffer i look in my mirror  and my tumor that was wrapped around  
the base of my neck and protruding from  my neck and bone hard was completely gone  
there was nothing there the whole thing was  dissolved and gone it was absolutely shocking  
so two weeks later jim goes to the doctors  for surgery and they're completely baffled  
they can't explain it this is a cancer care  manitoba and they said they told them that  
this is quote extraordinary they just couldn't  believe it it happened he told them yeah it's  
you know i think the et's because what else  could do it so they went ahead with the surgery  
to remove the necrotic tissue and found no trace  of cancer so this was listed as a miraculous cure  
jim did send me his medical records and also  this video of this orb entering into his body  
so yeah an amazing case and as jim says there's  no doubt about it for me that uh he was healed  
case number nine i love this case this  occurred to another police officer  
i don't think that's a coincidence uh  the police officer's name is alan godfrey  
uh he worked for the west yorkshire  metropolitan police in england he was  
a great officer he had been commended a  number of times for his investigative work  
involving murders about a year before  a ufo incident he had suffered a severe  
injury he was assaulted by three individuals  and kicked in the groin and as a result  
lost one of his testicles and lost his fertility  he went to the doctor and the doctors yes gave him  
this diagnosis and said he would never be able  to father children or have a normal sex life  
well she couldn't this turned out to be true and  he suffered from this condition for over a year  
uh when uh suddenly he had this encounter  this was on november 28 1980 he was on duty  
uh searching for a herd of missing cows when  he came upon a ufo in front of him on the road  
he actually drew this thing was very close very  large it reminded him of a double-decker bus  
suddenly he had a short period of disorientation  and experienced about 20 minutes of missing time  
he reported this to his superiors turns out there  was a lot of reports of ufos coming in from other  
people in this area despite this he received a  lot of ridicule it was around this time they had  
another encounter as well they were in bed allen  was asleep but his wife woke up to hear a very  
loud buzzing noise over the house she couldn't  imagine what it was this was the middle of the  
night and it was extremely loud and suddenly it  just fades away and it's gone and she falls asleep  
and they wake up the next morning and are intimate  for the first time you know since the accident  
this was not supposed to be able to  happen and even more astonishingly  
it was about two or three weeks later alan  godfrey's wife real realized she was pregnant  
and uh alan godfrey was pretty shocked and  he wondered if his wife was sleeping around  
but went to the doctor just in case and the doctor  was absolutely astonished because alan godfrey's  
condition had completely reversed itself and  this is exactly what the doctor told him the  
doctor says i don't know how it happened but  your condition has been completely reversed  
so yeah it's an excellent case they had a child  and i think there's the best proof right there  
i mean the proof is in the pudding there's the  child and how do you explain that all these  
cases by the way there's multiple cases like  this multiple cases of people being healed of  
burns or infertility and all these serious types  of diseases uh here's another excellent case which  
is number eight in the ranking this case comes  from grant cameron very prominent researcher who's  
on the ufo circuit and written a number of  excellent books on this subject and interviewed  
a man whose case i think is now pretty well  known in the ufo community the man is chris  
bledsoe he's a house builder and for years  suffered from a disease known as crohn's disease  
uh this is a pretty devastating disease as a  result he had to quit his job couldn't work was  
taking dozens of prescriptions and i'll just quote  chris bledsoe here as he says it's a debilitating  
disease you can't eat anything nothing it zaps  the life out of me basically it's like a cancer  
for years 14 or 15 years i was very sick i  mean very very sick to where i took heavy  
loads of medication daily if i missed a pill  in the morning i knew it within an hour or two  
so yeah he had suffered from this condition for  over a decade his family knew it his friends knew  
it everyone who knew jim knew about this disease  it cannot be faked and in gen and who would i mean  
so on january 8 2007 jim and his son and several  friends decided to go camping and they had a very  
major ufo encounter they all saw multiple objects  uh chris bledsoe saw an object he was alone at the  
camp because he couldn't hike and the others  were out hiking when they saw ufo he saw ufo2  
so there were multiple objects and he had missing  time he thought maybe it was 10 minutes an hour  
turned out to be for five hours that he was  missing his camp campmates and his son were  
frantic his son was pretty upset because the  son saw two greys who had paralyzed him for  
quite some time and this freaked them all out they  broke camp and were packing up when the ufos were  
still there ufos actually chased them from the  campsite they were still seeing humanoids at  
this point and actually saw these ufos following  home they saw humanoids at their home so this  
encounter was quite extensive and it was when  they got home that chris bledsoe realized that  
he was feeling much better uh he hadn't taken his  medication and uh stopped taking it immediately  
and uh as researcher grant cameron writes i'll  quote cameron here it was at that point that  
chris realized that he had forgotten his crohn's  medication in the house he however did not feel  
sick anymore especially considering it had been  many hours since he had taken his last pill he  
would take no more pills from that day on the  incurable crohn's was gone and as chris bledsoe  
himself says i walked up on these crafts and  from that point on i've never had another symptom  
not one symptom i've not taken one pill since  that's the great thing i was healed that day  
so yeah i mean how can you possibly  explain that it was what i like about it  
uh this is an illness that tragically he suffered  for years and years for a long time i don't know  
why it took the et's that long to cure him  that's what happens in a number of these cases  
but they did and it was instantaneous and it was  viewed by other people and verified by doctors   and you can't fake it another very interesting  aspect of chris bledsoe's case is he was giving  
prophecies some of which have already come true  including an earthquake in baja california in 2012  
and hurricane sandy that same year this is  something we see in a lot of other cases  
moving on case number seven comes from researcher  john carpenter a very prominent researcher  
who who's reported on a number of abduction  cases uh the case i want to quote here  
is about a young gentleman by the name of  eddie who suffered from severe profound  
color blindness he was totally colorblind i was  having encounters had been having encounters  
mostly his whole life which he recount recovered  only under hypnotic regression and under hypnosis  
we called this really incredible encounter where  he was not only physically examined but these  
gray type ets took his eyeball and actually  removed it from its socket and operated on it  
this turns up in a number of cases betty andreason  recorded this as have other ufo abductees
eddie did not think he was being implanted  he felt like they were just trying to fix his   eye and that's exactly what happened because  following this eddie was no longer colorblind  
he went to his eye doctor and verified it and  his colorblindness was almost completely healed  
now the only problem he had  was seeing the color green   so what i like about this case is this is  a irreversible chronic condition that was  
cured and the researcher john carpenter didn't  stop there he actually got a doctor's statement  
from the doctor and uh who verified this  condition saying that and and i'll quote
that his vision had improved all the  way up to green color blindness  
so yeah doctors reports before and after curing  an irreversible condition coming from a major  
researcher i think most major researchers  have cases like this here's another case  
from another researcher this is case number  six which comes from researcher bill hamilton  
who's been in this field for years  and years written a number of books   uh this occurred to a witness who would like to  remain anonymous she goes by the pseudonym morgana  
this occurred in california burbank california  morgana had been having lifelong experiences  
with gray type ets missing time the whole deal and  on december 4th 1994 was diagnosed with a tumor in  
her breast as bill hamilton says an x-ray found a  peculiarity in the axillary segment of the right  
breast this was followed by an ultrasonography  over the same area a small non-cystic mass  
1.6 by 0.6 centimeters was found in the problem  area so morgana was having quite a bit of pain  
and suffering from this so she was scheduled  for surgery in two weeks so she could have  
time to recover from a fever that she she  was experiencing so it was the day before  
surgery that she and morgana and her young  son were driving home when this ufo came down  
uh this was daylight came very low and uh very  close her son was very excited and told her this  
is a good sign you know this is a good sign you'll  see that night morgana was visited in her bedroom  
uh by she believed gray et's she didn't see  them but she uh did experience activity and  
had missing time fell unconscious and woke up  the next morning uh feeling profoundly better  
went to the doctor and the doctors were very  surprised because the they did the pre-op  
x-rays and couldn't find the non-cystic  mass as bill hamilton says and i'm quoting  
both the radiologist and the surgeon confirmed  that the previous diagnostic had revealed a  
solid mass and that solid masses don't just  disappear so yeah i know this witness i've met her
i know her to be an honest individual uh and uh  i like this case because there are before and  
after x-rays and tests which basically prove  that there was quote a miraculous healing  
and so many other cases yeah this is one of  like 15 or 20 cases involving people who've been  
healed of tumors so yeah many other cases like it  here's another excellent case from an excellent  
researcher this occurred on november 2nd 1968 to  a doctor again we have that weird pattern here  
doctors social workers police officers they're the  ones who are being healed people who have a long  
history of encounters as well that's definitely a  pattern this case occurred in the french alps and  
how it happened was this doctor went  and woke up in the middle of the night  
because he saw flashes of light coming from  his son's room and goes in there and looks  
out through the window and sees these two glowing  discs right next to his home they're very very low  
very close and uh suddenly these two  discs merge together it turns on its side  
and flashes him with a very powerful bright  beam of white light which hits him on the  
face and chest stuns him he's very disoriented  and stumbles back into his bed where he falls  
instantly asleep and wakes up the next morning  has this weird mark on his abdomen as does his son  
but what's most astounding is this doctor  was cured of two different conditions  
one thing that was cured was two days  earlier he was out chopping wood with an axe  
and the axe slipped and he gashed his  foot wide open there was a huge gash  
very painful he benches vegetated it  out and this wound was gone just healed  
apparently instantly but even more astounding  than that was the doctor had suffered from  
partial paralysis this was caused by an injury  he sustained in the algerian war years earlier  
which caused him to quit professional piano  playing he was a good piano player and  
following this ufo incident this partial paralysis  completely disappeared he no longer walked with a  
limp and was able to take up piano playing i can  so yeah another excellent case where the witness  
is himself a doctor uh so yeah so many cases but  we're getting to the top four now and this is  
case number four this is a very well known  case in the ufo literature there's a book   written exclusively about it and it  appears in a number of other ufo books  
this occurred to a hunter from rawlings  wyoming by the name of carl higdon  
and on october 25th 1974 he carl  hidden was actually an oil field worker  
uh but enjoyed hunting and was hunting  in the outside of rawlings wyoming  
when he was hunting elk and saw an elk and  actually lifted up his gun and took a shot  
when the bullet stopped in mid air and dropped  to the ground by the way this bullet was later  
analyzed and shown to have turned inside  out in a very peculiar manner at any rate  
higdon watches this happen and sees this  weird figure with straw hair a weird belt  
no visible ears no neck yellowish skin is about  six feet tall there's a very small ufo sort of a  
rectangular object right next to him and higdon  is pulled inside on the inside this object is  
much larger than on the outside he sees elk there  in glass containers other animals there are other  
people as well he's apparently taken to another  planet because he sees all these futuristic cities  
it's a long involved case important  here is he was physically examined and   apparently cured he woke up in a field they  found his truck uh some distance away from  
where it was out in another field there were no  tire tracks that was unexplainable also there was  
other people in the area where higdon saw  the ufo who saw apparently the same ufo  
higdon himself was extremely disoriented and had  amnesia and was very upset and traumatized was  
later hypnotized by leo sprinkle and recalled that  whole scenario but what's important here is higdon  
was suffering from two chronic conditions one  was he had had tuberculosis which left his lungs  
scarred up and he was also suffering from  painful kidney stones both these conditions  
had completely reversed he no longer had any  tubercular scars on his lungs and his kidney  
stones were gone so yeah two chronic conditions  cured at once and many cases do have multiple  
cures very many cases of kidney stones i mean one  guy was on the way to the hospital to be treated  
and a ufo swooped down and cured him at the  last second we see that in a number of cases   where people are cured literally on the way to  the hospital or even in the hospital ten percent  
of healing cases take place in the hospital  so yeah now let's move to the top three cases  
number three is a case that was originally  investigated by argentina researcher pedro romanek  
it's an amazing case pedro is the former  commander of an international airline  
the technical investigator for the argentine  air force aviation accidents investigation board  
and a leading ufo researcher in his country   the case involves a 73 year old night watchman  by the name name of ventura maceras and what  
happened is he was outside his home when he  saw a ufo it was very close this is a typical  
saucer shaped object metallic with colored  lights and portholes and looking through  
the portholes he saw humanoid figures ventura  was struck by a beam of light from this object  
the object at that point left ventura immediately  suffered a number of uh alarming symptoms very  
unpleasant symptoms that seem to uh echo radiation  sickness radiation sickness his symptoms include  
hair loss headaches nausea diarrhea eye irritation  and swollen red pustules boils on his body  
so again these are symptoms you can't fake he was  very sick for a number of weeks and uh not only  
that there was other physical evidence there were  some eucalyptus trees where this incident happened  
eucalyptus trees are very tall up to you know  100 200 feet and the very tops of these trees  
showed burns they were all burned and not only  that there's a stream nearby and there was a  
very large number of catfish which died under  mysterious means so yeah there's apparently some  
radiation going on here or something at any rate  pedro called in other researchers and uh because  
this was a really amazing case and uh maseras  was interviewed actually more than 60 times  
not only by ufo researchers but by a wide  variety of officials including doctors  
police officers government officials as well  so very very well verified case that has  
never shown any evidence of a hoax and what's the  most interesting about to me and i think important  
here is that the witness ventura maseras  experienced a very strange symptom uh in  
which he apparently started to grow a new set of  teeth which was verified by doctors and by pedro  
who writes i'm quoting here since approximately  february 10th maseras has observed that new teeth  
have been appearing in his upper left gum at  the time of my visit i was able to confirm that  
two front teeth and two cheek teeth were coming  through and were approximately two millimeters  
to three millimeters long so yeah a third  set of teeth at age 73 that's incredible  
that's an amazing case and he continued  to have encounters following this incident   at one point the et's came back and told him  that cancer was actually caused by a virus  
so here's case number two a really excellent  case fairly well known in the literature this  
occurred on september 3rd 1965 to to police  officers here we go again select the third case  
involving police officers on this list alone and  there are others uh this occurred to two police  
officers one one by the name of uh deputy robert  goode and the other is deputy billy mccoy and they  
were driving along highway 35 in damon texas had  we're returning from a football game when they  
saw this gigantic ufo they think it was at least  300 feet long 50 feet wide very low to the ground  
shining down a purple beam of light and this  beam of light playing across the field and  
starts coming towards them and boom it hits their  car lights it up completely and deputy goode had  
his arm outside the window and he could actually  feel this beam he said it was warm and tingling  
well earlier that day he had been bitten by  an alligator by his son's baby pet alligator  
on his finger and this left a pretty severe  wound uh it was very painful bleeding swollen  
he had it all bandaged up and at the time you  know this this arm was hanging out the window  
so these two police officers are pretty freaked  out because this object is very close so they flee  
the scene at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour  and they screech into this diner and start talking  
about this incident that they saw and uh deputy  mccoy noticed that good was using his left hand  
and said well bob the only good thing about this  is that it's made you forget about your finger  
and officer good says you know it's  not even sore so officer good unwrapped  
his finger and suddenly sees that  this cut is completely gone and as  
deputy mccoy says the inflammation was  gone and he threw the bandages away  
they actually returned to the scene and the  object was still there they freaked out and  
raced away again and reported this incident to  the air force the air force was very impressed  
because of the credibility of the witnesses  because officer mccoy turns out is a departmental  
head and is supervises more than 42 other  police officers so i mean he's a very high level  
uh official at the police and a great witness  so ellington air force base sends over major  
leach to interview the officers and officer leach  was very impressed and believes the officers saw  
ufo and i'll quote major leech major leach says  after talking with both officers involved in this  
sighting there is no doubt in my mind that they  definitely saw some unusual object or phenomenon  
so yeah this is a great case it's one of the first  healings reported i like that i like that it has  
excellent almost unimpeachable  witnesses that it was   observed by multiple witnesses and that it was  verified by the air force itself so i mean a  
really great case here is probably my favorite  case of all the ufo healings i've documented  
i love this case because it was for many reasons  and i'll just tell you the story this uh the main  
researcher here is general paulo uchoa who was  a three-star general in the brazilian army uh  
paulo uchoa's daughter is denise  uchoa slater who talks about this case  
the actual witness is paulo's father alfredo  uchoa who was also a general in the brazilian  
army very highly placed in the army and was sort  of the let's see he was the education director  
for the brazilian military academy now  alfredo uchoa is very well known in brazil  
he's actually the pioneer of brazilian ufology  and has written a number of books about ufos  
including this next amazing case so alfredo  had been going on regular ufo stakeouts  
successfully and was calling down ufos in front  of large groups of people who witnessed this  
and uh at the time alfredo had a housekeeper this  is in the late 1960s and he had a housekeeper  
18 years old a young woman by the name of  bernadette and at some point bernadette
suffered from the disease she contracted the  disease known as shogus disease this is a very  
serious disease it's caused by the bite of the  triotamine beetle it can cause fever headaches  
heart damage inflammation of tissues it's very  often fatal and it certainly appeared to be fatal  
in bernadette's case because she sickened very  quickly her condition was deteriorating rapidly  
numerous surgeries were not helping and  doctors expected that she would die shortly and  
bernadette was well loved by the uchoa family   and they wanted to do everything they could  to help her and the surgeries weren't working  
so alfredo decided to appeal to the et's and  this is exactly what he did during a ufo stakeout  
he telepathically called out to them and says  you know these displays are nice and all but  
we'd really like it if you could actually heal  bernadette of chagas disease and general uchoa  
received a telepathic message to bring  bernadette to a ufo stakeout to a certain area  
so that's what he did he brought his small group  of researchers and bernadette was taken to this  
area and sure enough a ufo showed up bernadette  was separated from the group ets approached  
humanoids and actually worked on bernadette  this was viewed by uchoa and other witnesses  
using a blue light they healed her and  returned her to the group and bernadette  
her condition improved very rapidly and the chagas  disease was gone there was no trace of it they  
brought her back to the doctor doctors couldn't  believe it her condition was completely reversed  
so yeah this is a great case i love it because  it's got unimpeachable witnesses like paulo uchoa  
and this case is still being talked about today  because uchoa's son alfredo and alfredo's son  
denise uh who showed us later are going on  the ufo circuit and presenting the evidence  
for this case and showing the doctor's reports  which they actually obtained so they have  
bernadette's medical records which show that  this miraculous healing has actually taken place  
it's a fantastic case and i just don't see how  you can deny it and say that this didn't take  
place and it's one of a number of cases where  people have asked for a healing and received  
it yeah i know another case in which a lady was  healed of total kidney failure she prayed for  
healing and got one she thought it might be angels  though she kind of knew it was et's particularly  
later when they abducted her and uh showed her  her liver and full living color like a hologram  
or her kidney rather and said your kidneys are  much better but look at your liver they showed   her her liver it was covered with dark spots and  they told her you have to stop drinking diet coke  
because it's damaging your liver often  they will give people dietary advice   they told one lady she was eating too much fat  fatty foods and that she needed to lose weight  
the witness was not happy about that she did not  appreciate being given dietary advice and being  
called fat by little greys but yeah a lot of cases  like this one guy was hooked on marijuana and the  
et's told him you have to stop smoking marijuana  this is not the life we had planned for you  
so i mean yeah there are a lot of cases a  number of cases could have made this list   but i'll give them honorable mentions like helena  charbonneau who in 1975 was cured of cancer or  
another case involving a little girl who was  cured of cancer in metropolis brazil in 1957  
her whole family witnessed a ufo land in the  backyard and small et's come into the living room  
and cure her so that was another widely viewed  encounter or the case of jean sear who in 1979  
was cured of multiple sclerosis it's a great  case multiple people saw the ufo it was  
caught on radar by the local airport wendell  stevens investigated that case there's a case  
of lynn plaskett a florida councilwoman who was  in 1975 had t-cell lymphoma and was cured of that  
or another case in 1980 in longmont colorado of  a gentleman who was suffering from skin cancer  
was abducted and returned and his skin  cancer had dramatically decreased in size  
which was verified by his doctor uh a case of a  lady i interviewed who i call lynette she's just  
received her doctor's records showing that she  was cured of a tumor one of bud hopkins clients  
debbie jordan of kokomo indiana who in 1993 had  a cyst and went to the doctor and the doctor  
couldn't find the cyst that had been healed  and ruffle has a case very much like it of a   lady who was healed of a cancerous tumor in her  breast in 1995 another excellent case occurred  
in 2012 in pennsylvania to joy davies she's an  elderly woman who was suffering from arthritis  
had encountered the woods behind her home  taken on board short cute looking humanoids  
not your typical grays uh who healed her of  arthritis she's now back to playing tennis or  
another case from leonard stringfield of a teenage  kid who was cured struck by a beam of light  
outside his home in florence kentucky in 1975 and  was cured of a head cold saw the doctor a couple  
of days later and the doctor's i see no trace of  any cold so his he and his mom both verified not  
only his condition but saw the ufo as well so  yeah i mean the 20 cases i just listed are just  
the tip of the iceberg about five percent of the  total number of cases and represent i think some  
of the best cases but yeah another researcher  might have picked a completely different list  
these 300 cases which i documented in my book  the healing power of ufos are just the tip of  
the iceberg most people don't report their cases  i mean less than one in ten really it's closer to  
one in a hundred so you could times that number of  three hundred by ten three thousand by a a hundred  
three so we're talking thirty thousand possible  cases of ufo healings because there are a lot of  
miraculous healings uh that people attribute to  angels perhaps or just a spontaneous remission  
so i'm convinced there are a lot more cases than  the ones i've documented and i think the best  
proof of these ufo healings is not one single  case but the fact that there are so so many  
which are extremely familiar and uh just so many  cases i think these are very important cases  
as well i think that they show that healing  humanity is probably one of the et's  
main agendas it's done by all types of vts  grays praying mantis human looking type  
the cases reach back a hundred years  they come from all over the world   so i think that's important it's also important  because these cases provide very good evidence for  
the reality of ufos ufo validity i also think  they're important because they have something  
to teach the medical community they show us that  healings they show us that healings can be done  
through beams of light they also show us that  there's no such thing as a chronic condition or  
incurable and just that just about anything can be  healed cancer aids diabetes tuberculosis all kinds  
of very serious diseases there's like 30  cases of cancer i could do a show on cancer  
healings alone and most importantly i think these  cases show us a very positive side to the ets  
not all people who've been healed are happy about  it they still feel like you know they're being   used and violated but others consider the ets very  friendly and call them their family or friends so  
you have sort of a bell curve there uh there are  goody teas i think and bad et's for the most part  
i think it's easier to prove that they  are more friendly than humans certainly  
because there's not only all these healing cases  uh but there's many positive things that happen  
on board ufos people are spiritually awakened  they're taught about alternative energy they're  
given all kinds of prophecies of upcoming  disasters or possible environmental destruction  
and these sort of things and what we don't see  is what i would call sadistic type of behavior  
which is pretty prevalent among humans  so ultimately i'm very hopeful about how  
all this turns out and ufo contact i  don't think it's something to be afraid of  
and i think these healing cases deserve  a lot more attention than they're getting   so that's my presentation thank you once  again for watching and keep having fun.
