UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: PART TWO
Jul 26, 2024

Summary:
Jul 26, 2024
Ask and ye shall receive! I recently put out a challenge on my YouTube channel, name any location on Earth, such as your hometown, and I bet I can find a UFO encounter that occurred there! I received more than 150 responses. Challenge accepted! And guess what? I was right! So far, I have been successful in locating UFO cases in every location provided. UFOs are seen everywhere. Pick a location and the chances are it has a long history of UFO encounters. This video is Episode Two of an ongoing series I call “UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN.” For this episode, by special request from you, the viewers, I cover the locations: Locust Grove, Oklahoma; McMinnville, Oregon; India (yes, the country!); Berkshire Mountains, Massachusetts; Sacramento, California and Nova Scotia, Canada. The encounters in these locations include sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard encounters. The evidence supporting these cases includes multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs, radar-returns, landing traces, animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Have UFOs visited your hometown? Likely, the answer is yes!

LOCUST GROVE, OKLAHOMA. This is a very small rural town with a population of less than 1400 people, and yet, there is a UFO case involving multiple sightings of strange orbs along with strange animal reactions.

MCMINNVILLE, OREGON. On May 11, 1950, the town of McMinnville earned international headlines when Paul and Evelyn Trent captured two photographs of a metallic saucer hovering over their farmhouse. Today, the photos are considered among the best on record. But McMinnville has many other cases. In 1957, the Kelchner family viewed a glowing egg-shaped object over their poultry farm for 30 minutes. In 1976, a man called the National UFO reporting Service (NUFORC) to report his sighting of a UFO being chased by jet fighters. In 1991, Susan Wold called the newspapers about her sighting of a solid object in view for 45 minutes. There are more incredible sightings, including a report of a strange humanoid seen by campers at an isolated McMinnville Ranch.

INDIA. With a population well in excess of one billion people, India has countless UFO cases. For this reason, only humanoid cases are presented. In March of 1931, a 14-year-old boy from the Andhra Pradesh area of India says he met a wise old Sage who took him onboard a craft where he was given predictions of future disasters. Other cases include a 1954 landing with humanoids near a beryllium mine; a 1976 encounter between a woman and an eight-foot-tall humanoid; a family’s multiple encounters with a UFO and entities with the appearance of Hindu Gods, and more. In 1985, a girl from Bihar was taken onboard and examined by ETs. In 2001, a group of boys from Ahmedabad reported their encounter with two short pale beings. One amazing account includes a UFO and humanoid encounter by a group of scientists in the Indian Himalayas, involving an actual photograph of the humanoid. And many other cases.

BERKSHIRE MOUNTAINS, MASSACHUSETTS. This area in the western part of the state contains many cities, so in this episode I cover a few famous accounts, including the alleged onboard experience of talk show host, Morton Downey Jr. Another very famous case is that of Thom Reed, who in 1967 along with his family, had a very close encounter. Other sightings occurred in 1973, 1978 and more.

SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA. This city contains more than a half million residents, and has a long and rich history of sightings, landings, and humanoids. The earliest occurred in 1896 with the famous airship wave. Classic saucer sightings were made in 1947, 1950, 1952, 1955, 1957 and more. One of the strangest UFO cases on record occurred to a paperboy on July 11, 1961 that must be heard to be believed. A truly astonishing case involves a witness who saw a landed UFO and humanoids near McClellan AFB. Encounters continue, with some as recent as 2018.

NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA. This area contains many towns and cities and a huge variety of encounters. In 1952, the crew of the Marcala reported their close encounter with a silvery UFO. In 1952, a trained weather observer had an amazing encounter with a disc. An amazing humanoid encounter occurred in 1953. A harrowing USO encounter occurred in May 1963. Nova Scotia’s most famous case by far is the Shag Harbor incident of October 4, 1967. More landings, USOs, pilot encounters and more, including an incredible encounter of a UFO over a graveyard.

Six specific locations – all with a history of UFO encounters. As should be obvious by now, UFOs are seen everywhere: sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard experiences and more. Pretty much every location on this planet has a long history of encounters. Those who don’t think UFOs are real have not done their research. It’s that simple. The evidence is undeniable. We are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal several episodes ago I
put out a challenge name your hometown and I will find a UFO encounter there
and wow did you guys respond I've received now to date over 150 locations
from you guys so thanks very much this is going to be a lot of research but I'm
gonna do my best so today's episode is called UFOs in your
hometown episode 2 this is going to be an ongoing series I'm going to put these
episodes out as I complete the research for each of these locations and wow there is a lot of UFO
encounters again this just goes to show you can spin the globe put your finger
down at random and there is more than likely a UFO encounter that has occurred
there so the Lo I'm covering today include Locust Grove Oklahoma McMinville
Oregon the entire country of India birkshire mountains in
Massachusetts and Nova Scotia Canada now I'm still taking requests but do keep in
mind with over 150 responses it's going to take a while and I would request that
you don't name a an entire country or more than one city I'm only one one guy
here I'm going to do what I can but this takes a lot of research but while did I find some amazing cases of course not
just sightings but Landings and humanoids which to me are far more interesting but onboard encounters as
well a whole variety of some really amazing encounters some are so unusual
I've tried to pick the cases that are the most extensive the most credible
something that have something new to offer to our understanding of ET contact
so this is by no means fully comprehensive but certainly gives a sort
of overview of UFO activity in any particular area what's also interesting
is in this episode you will see the full range of UFO evidence we're talking Landing Trace cases physiological
effects animal reactions electromagnetic disturbances some amazing photographic
evidence radar returns people who say there's no evidence for UFOs have simply
not done their homework so yeah I think you'll find this episode particularly
interesting I sure had a lot of fun researching it lots to cover here so
let's just get started with our first location and the first location I'm covering and I'm doing these in order by
the way in order of location received and the first location I'm covering today today is Locust Grove Oklahoma
this is by special request of making D so this is for you making D and I have
to tell you I didn't have a whole lot of luck finding UFOs in this location turns out this is a very small town but I did
find something and I think you'll find it pretty compelling this case is from
muon and apparently uninvestigated but per the report a man heard his dogs
barking he went outside and this is when he saw unexplained lights rising up from
behind a bush just about 30 ft away they came towards him and then
towards his dog and he said that some are like balls of plasma and seem to throw off Sparks While others appeared
to spin and change shape he actually took some video of them he does say that
his dog reacted to them didn't like them and was apparently able to sense them when they weren't even visible and can
also smell where they have been previously it's an odd report but certainly interesting so there you go
not a whole lot but I tried and there certainly was one case but now let's
move to the next one which is McMinville Oregon and this is By Request of happy girl and happy girl you'll be happy to
know I found some amazing cases in fact McMinville has given the entire world
some really outstanding contributions to UFO history in fact it's got one of the
most famous and well verified photographic cases ever but like in all
these locations that I'm presenting tonight except one there are humanoids as well some really interesting
sightings and landings and so forth so let's just get started with McMinville
Oregon there was no way that Evelyn and Paul Trent could have predicted that on
May 11 1950 something would happen that would make them world famous and would have
put the little town of McMinville Oregon on the UFO map forever was a hazy evening around 745
p.m. they were both in the backyard of their home which is just Southwest of McMinville Evelyn was feeding the
rabbits and this is when a UFO appeared as Evelyn says we both saw the object at
the same time they described it as a metallic saucer about 30 ft wide and
only about 1500 ft away from them and 50 ft up in the sky so quite close now
Evelyn had seen UFOs a few times before and was disappointed because nobody
believed her when she talked about it her husband Paul didn't really believe in UFOs at all but now that one was
right in front of their eyes they both immediately thought of the Kodak camera that they had already loaded with film
as Evelyn says Paul thought it was in the car but I was sure sure it was in the house I was right Paul took the
first picture the object was coming in towards us and seemed to be tipped up a little bit was very bright almost
silvery and there was no noise or smoke so after taking the first picture Paul
quickly rewound the camera and about 30 seconds later as the object began to gather speed and turned to the Northwest
he snapped a second picture and as Paul says there wasn't any Flame and it was
moving fairly slow then I snapped the first picture it moved a little to the
left and I moved to the right to take another picture then it seemed to pick up speed and vanished I was kind of
scared you know you hear so much talk about these things and the
government now after this happened Evelyn tried to phone her in-laws who lived just down the road but was unable
to reach them they really weren't sure what they had photographed and afterwards just kind of went on with
life as normal one month later in June they developed the pictures and were
delighted to see that they had in fact captured two very clear images of this
apparent craft and at first they shared these photographs only among the family
until their niece who was in the Army saw the photos and urged them to tell
somebody so Paul decided to tell his Banker who was very impressed by Paul's
honesty and the photos and actually hung them up in the bank window and this is what caught the
attention of a reporter from the local newspaper who actually requested the negatives and published them as a front
page news story and the result was like setting off an atomic bomb the newspaper
began receiving calls hundreds of them in fact Life Magazine contacted them and
published the photos in the June 1950 issue now one point the newspaper was
receiving about a thousand letters per day mostly from people requesting copies
of these photographs others of course said that they had seen similar objects and wanted to share their own stories
but the newspaper eventually printed more than 6,200 copies of these photos and even
two weeks later they were receiving 50 requests every day now per researcher Frank Edwards the
Air Force Folks at the Pentagon said that these photographs were the best
civilian photographs that they had seen up to that time now Paul was amazed by everyone's
interest in his photos he was very reluctant at first to come forward as he says I didn't believe all that talk
about flying saucers before but now I have an IDE idea the Army knows what
they are of course no surprise reporters besiege the the Trent and they did many
interviews investigators of course came to study the photos and while some tried to debunk the photos experts such as
Bruce mcabe and many others declared them genuine and no evidence of fakery
was ever found ultimately after being besieged by reporters for so long Paul Trent refused
to talk anymore about it in fact the ridicule took a toll in the whole family
as his Tammy said we were the alien family that's all that was talked about
was the alien family but even as late as 2008 there continued to be controversy
when the Trent relatives tried to get the negatives back from the newspaper turned out the newspaper didn't have
them turned out that Bruce macabe had them and had been holding them for about 25 years he returned them to the news
register who had first given them to him and the news register did not want to
give them back to the family now Bruce mcabe wrote that the trent family had rightful ownership but the newspaper
said that they these negatives should be part of a quote permanent display in Yam
Hill County now the Trent don't have the money to sufur rights to these photos
these negatives this is apparently where this case currently stands but in any case the McMinville photographs are now
considered by most researchers to be among the best UFO photographs in history and here I just want to play a
little 4 minute long audio clip of Evelyn Trent describing this amazing sighting and the
photographs that they took I had to look up and I seen this thing and and I ran
into the house tell him about it he went one way after a camera and I went the other way after a camera between the
both of us we found it the best thing I to say it would be just about the size of a parachute without any strings or
anything like that it was all flat on the bottom and it was silvery color I was about the only thing it was that
there was no smoke no noise either one was just above the electric light wires
away I just you know the distance and stuff I just don't know it they have hovered for a while you know just like
that and he just the picture and right just as soon as he took the picture he round the film to roll you know to Pi
another one and as soon as he took it his turn and just took all very fast the
next McMinville case I'd like to talk about occurred on November 5 1957 and
this was actually during a massive UFO wave which was sweeping across the United
States Sam kelchner saw this strange craft hovering over his home just south
of McMinville he said it was egg-shaped glowed orange and was hovering over his
Poultry Farm real close no more than 1,000 ft away while he and his family
were able to view it through binoculars it remained for a full 30 minutes as it
moved a few times hovered then finally took off across the sky he did call the
police who told him that they had in fact received many calls from people in the surrounding
areas another report comes from John or who said that the following day he was
walking near the AMD High School in AMD located just south of McMinville when he
saw UFO another case occurred on December 28th 1976 when the National UFO Reporting
service newfork actually received a call about a McMinville sighting and I'd like
to play a 9 minute long audio clip which is quite interesting regarding this
sighting yes sir I'm coming from the news register in McMinville Oregon yes uh to see if there's any kind of UFO
citing report out of this area from last night no sir none
whatsoever in fact we didn't even have a call last night okay there were we had
we had one in here which was a uh involved with someone firefighters UFO
because there it was a soundless two soundless lights which were followed by uh 45 minutes to an
hour and a half of military jet aircraft I see circling and maneuvering and uh
and the other the object apparently taking evasive action uh uh for about a
45 minute period and then another 45 minutes of of just military jet aircraft
uh flying over and circling very interesting do you have the party's name to call it in yes I
do we were completely fogged in in this area he the only reason that he saw is it was well outside of town 8 miles out
clear up in the the boondoggles I see and he uh he where where he lives and he
was he was up above the fog uh there's a you he's good source
and was uh was in control of his faculties at the time I've been unable to locate any uh I was going to call him
a coure but there were no jet aircraft out of Portland last night they were fogged
in um so I've been unable to locate any course of the of the four military jet
aircraft which he said were up there for an hour and a half last night okay we'll see if we can come up
some information if we do well we get back to you okay who am I talking to uh my name is Jeb
bline so if uh yeah if you uh anything might come on I think I'll probably still make a call to or would you
normally make calls to the the uh mord and wouldbe and so forth on something
like this to check on aircraft check on air we probably would yes I might just
wait and and contact you again what is your name uh Robert Gribble g r i BBL
e okay okay well I'll uh I'll if I don't hear back from you I'll give a call back
this afternoon okay okay all right thank you bye Party Center yes can I speak to
Mr gille please this is he yeah this is do you called earlier yes sir uh we're interested in uh the objects that you
saw in the sky the other night mhm I wonder if we could get a description of that
um were fairly high altitude so it was basically all it was is just a um a very
very bright light and more of a um
circular you know shape to it um seemed like when I saw it across I could see a
little bit of a light whether it might just been a light you know from trailing from speed it was TR in at looked like
there was a smaller light towards the back of it but it was it was at a fairly high altitude and it was very bright
light looked like a almost like a you know like a a landing light or something you know when you're at a close distance
to it so uh it was that was that bright so but
it was um be very difficult to estimate you know like how high it was or anything
cuz so so bright that I did see aircraft in in you know like jet aircraft in the
area at the time and I could make out uh I don't know how close they were to it
but I could make out all the running lights on the aircraft like I say I can't really judge how large it was or
you know or how high it was just because I didn't know how big it was in the first place so but what time did you
spot that uh just almost exactly 8:00 that was Monday night mhm
okay and was the object on the Move yes definitely it was circling it kept doing
a um it was coming from North West and circling and circling I first
saw it coming out of the Northwest but it was doing a definite circle pattern as it was moving at a very high rate of
speed uh um it made four passes and just as near as I could tell the exact same
course uh it didn't it didn't seem to vary at all but it was going out at
quite a distance to the east to the Northeast and then coming back through um I could not hear any sound
from it that after I first saw it then I the aircraft came in you know then I saw
them I don't know if it was there before or not you know I don't know how long it had been up there yes because I just
noticed it you know by coincidence I happen to go upstairs and look out the window and see it so I don't know how long that you know that it was
visible uh but after I did see it the first time then I could start to see uh
the aircraft which seemed to be like they were pursuing it or at Le shadowing it and then I could start to hear the
jet engines from them but when I first saw it there were no aircraft in the area you know my first sighting of it
was just you know 30 seconds or a minute uh but I could not hear any sound
from it after a point then there were a number of aircraft in the area and I
could hear them so I don't know you know uh they were making so much noise I
couldn't tell whether it was making any noise or not right did the object itself seem to be evading the
aircraft uh it seemed to be sticking to uh pretty much of a
course um it did seemed like that it would you know that it would accelerate and go away from them I would what I saw
in my first my first reaction when I saw it was that that it did try to move away
from them and that they were definitely UNP have it I see um our checking around
yesterday said everybody saying claiming that there were no military aircraft up that night which are kind of interesting
uhhuh did the object maintain the same color at all times yes it did it was
just a a brilliant light brilliant white light uh-huh did you see it until it
moved away yes it it went out did it circle pattern went off towards these
like almost du East right towards Mount Hood and that was the last that was the last I saw of it the aircraft came back
and after I'd lost sight of of the the object the aircraft continued to go back
and forth in a you know and what looked like a they were patrolling the search pattern or something search
pattern uh they were the aircraft seem to be doing like a a criss cross thing
for at one point um but I lost sight of it at about 8:30 or 8:45
I finally completely lost sight of the object and then all from then on all I followed the aircraft
uhhuh okay about how long did you watch that I watched uh from 8 till 8:45 I saw
the the object but then I I stayed and watched for you know until well after
9:00 continued to watch the airplanes uh then everything quieted down but at one
point there were I counted what I I thought there were a lot of stars out that night I live up in
a fairly high elevation it was you was quite foggy but it was extremely clear and there were a lot of stars out so but
at one point it looked like a light show going on so yes with many aircraft going but I counted what I I think was four
Jets at one time so you have an 800 number there by any
chance no we don't unfortunately I was thinking that somebody did have but I think there's
one in in the southwest that there's one in Illinois but it's confined to Police use only it's not available to the
public we're the only public Center of its kind in the country yeah this is the first time I'd
ever seen anything like that I've never um flown a lot that's the first time I'd ever seen
it and I don't think it would even have interested me I would have passed it off as a a meteor or something if I had not
seen the aircraft which were I felt to be pursuit of it so okay now was this
object you saw it come out of the Northwest it was maintaining this circular pattern as it was moving through the sky I mean was it circling
as it was moving or did it just maintain a constant it maintained a pretty much
of a constant uh pattern yeah um I first
thought it was very very foggy that night I thought that somebody was you know was trying to find a place to put
down or something right and there's a prir of good sized airport here in M and
that was my first thought and then when I saw the other aircraft moving around it and I started to start to get my
interest up a little bit right um they definitely stayed around for a
while okay well we sure appreciate this information and if we come up with anything regarding the object's
identification we'll get back to you and let you know okay if I happen to is this a um is your number a 24-hour number yes
it is okay if I happen to uh to check Che it again then I will alert you then
very good thank you thank you bye here's another very interesting case which occurred on the morning of December 13
1991 Susan Wald glanced out the south-facing window of her McMinville
home when she noticed a strange object quote way way up and Far Far Away now it
was still a little dark out this was very early in the morning so she got her glasses and watched this object for
about 45 minutes she said it looked almost rectangular but was filled with
many brilliant lights and finally around 800 a.m. when it was getting light this
object disappeared but she is convinced she saw something unexplained first she
told only a friend but later called the newspaper and as she says I wasn't dreaming I don't know if I believe in
flying saucers but I know I saw one now here is another case from new Fork which
occurred on Independence Day July 4th 1997 lots of UFO sightings on July 4th
at any rate the witness was standing outside his McMinville home using binoculars to watch a nearby fireworks
display when he saw a disc shaped object with red orange lights hovering in place
in the sky suddenly it was gone and he noticed that it had in fact shot upwards
and was now hovering in a different location over a field the it's very interesting because there are so many
reports of UFOs being seen during Fireworks shows now I did find one
humanoid case which is quite brief it comes from researcher George filer who
writes that on February 2nd 1999 a group of campers were sitting
around a campfire at an isolated Ranch outside of McMinville when they heard
noises in the surrounding brush going to investigate they did find quote weird
foot prints so they followed them where they led into a meadow it was at this
point that they saw a huge bizarre creature walking through the meadow at a fast pace it was dark they Shone a
flashlight at it and it ran away but here's the interesting UFO connection
because later that night they did see an unidentified bright light shoot over the
area at high speed here's a more recent case it occurred around 9:45 on the
evening of April 17 2002 as a 9-year-old boy looked out the
window of his McMinville home and saw a glowing oval-shaped object moving slowly
it went right past his window then suddenly accelerated off into the distance then 3 seconds later he saw a
triangular object appear in nearly the same place and suddenly Dart
away a final McMinville case occurred one month later this was from new Fork
but was investigated by researcher Eric berer and this involves a mother and her child who around midnight on May 7 2002
heard a strange sound that they couldn't identify or locate the source of finally
the mother looked out the dining room window and this is when she saw a saucer-shaped craft with colored lights
around it and this object was hovering and spinning in place above some trees
besides this house then this subject appeared to descend behind the trees and it was gone
so there you go that's McMinville Oregon I hope you found that interesting happy girl that's for you but wow it sure was
interesting in terms of Paul and Evelyn Trent's photograph of a UFO one of the
most famous and best verified photographic cases in UFO history did
not know the whole story really interesting some other really compelling cases there in McMinville so thanks very
much Happy girl I learned something new each time I do research for these
episodes that's certainly true with McMinville and now we move to our next location and this is by special request
of Anup dat and thanks so much anus dat for giving me an entire country to cover
which is India and that happens to be a lot of people there so by no means am I
covering this entire country what I have done is focused solely on humanoid cases
some really interesting humanoid cases so that's what I'm going to be talking about in terms of Encounters in India it
was just too much you could easily write a multivolume set of books on Encounters
in India so please forgive me for limiting myself to humanoid encounters but again I think these are the most
interesting and I certainly hope you guys find it interesting as well again
India is a pretty big country with an enormous population so it should come as
no surprise there there are quite a few humanoid cases and they go way back in
fact the earliest one I could find occurred one morning in March of
1931 a 14-year-old boy was tending cattle in the mountains of the Andra
Pradesh area of India this is when he saw a figure who he believed to be a
quote Sage meditating under a tree so he walks up to this guy and asks him where
he came from and this man said from the distant stars at this point he actually
led the boy to a dis shaped craft landed some distance away in the mountains and
invited the boy inside and inside this craft this boy said he saw other quote
wise men inside he was told to sit in a golden chair he was given fruit to eat
he was shown all these beautiful rooms with mirrorlike screens which actually showed images of himself in his home
Village and other strange images which he perceived to be various Hindu
gods he was told that these screen-like im images these instruments would soon
be publicly avail ailable to everyone so this could be an apparent prediction of
TVs which at that point had not yet been made publicly available but this boy says he was then
shown images of worldwide disasters of earthquakes volcanoes and tsunamis and
was told that these would in fact occur in our future so this has all the elements we
see in modern day onboard experiences now here's another case which occurred in
1954 this was a big year for humanoids in this area and this case from Dennis
brace involves a disc-shaped object that reportedly landed in a field near madis
India no exact date is provided but according to the report human looking
occupants came out and spoke with a woman and other people in the neighborhood and then returned to their
craft which took off Report with an exact date occurred on September 15 1954
when about 800 villagers in the man boom Bear area said that they saw 12 foot
wide gray saucer hovering about 500 ft over a mine which actually supplied
burum for the atomic energy commission so that's an interesting detail it was
just a few months later on November 2nd 1954 that residents of Kolkata saw a
quote brightly illuminated object object with human forms on board moving from east to west
one lady from dubris said that she saw a saucer land in a field and then quickly
take off and it frightened her so badly that She fainted was later that same
month on November 27 that about 100 people said that they saw a quote boat
flying it had a bright light on one end and actually landed in this field three
people emerged stayed for about 5 minutes re-entered the object which took off at high
speed so quite a few cases here's one from Janet and colid board which took
place on July 1st 1976 in madis and in this case a woman reported
her encounter with an 8ot tall humanoid with shiny skin which she said emerged
from the forest then returned back into the woods and moments later she saw a large yellow red R cigar-shaped object
Rise Up from the woods and dart off into the distance now here's a really interesting and extensive case from
India this account comes from prant Solomon and involves a family lit cha
his wife Nina and their two sons they were walking near their home in Bombay
one evening in the summer of 1957 and a UFO hovered overhead and
struck them with a beam of light following this the husband lit became
very pensive and quiet in the days that followed but later that night he was
driving to juu beach when this UFO reappeared hovered over his car and sent
down a beam of yellow light and it was one night sometime
later that the family was hosting a birthday party when one of the girls at the party cried out that she saw a quote
blue man with four arms standing in the doorway now later the girl's mother
wondered about this and realized that this sounded very much like the Hindu god Vishnu so that's certainly strange
to say the least but it was that night that nah Chala woke up to see her
bedroom filled with light and what appeared to be various Hindu gods such as Vishnu Ganesh and others and not only
that she saw her husband levitating in the air next to her now this being that
looked like Vishnu began to speak telepathically to her telling her not to be afraid that their work here was over
that they would be leaving in peace at which point her husband lit floated back into bed and the light and the beings
vanished certainly an odd case and here's another one in June of
1985 a 17-year-old girl from bear was found by a local farmer with apparent
glowing patches on her body uh she was disoriented and rushed to a hospital
where they diagnosed her with radiation Burns and according to her own testimony
she said she hadd been walking in a field when a silver disc appeared overhead sent down a beam of light and
pulled her inside inside this craft she saw dwarf sized beings which approached
her and said no harm would come to her they proceeded to place her in a glass Booth which she said seemed to scan her
and that's all she remembered now there are also some pretty recent encounters as reported to
new Fork on February 28th 2001 a group of boys from aabad were
bicycling to Temple when they said that they saw two short pale figures with
kind of onion shaped heads and large black eyes after these figures left they found
small footprints in the area and whether or not this is related is hard to sa for
sure but one of the boys became quite ill after the encounter and had to be
hospitalized interestingly later a fruit seller said that he also saw several
similar beings in a field in this same area around the same time here's a very
interesting case which was reported on by Whitley streber it occurred in the Indian
Himalayas this was on September 27 2004 when a group of scientists and you can
actually see them here this case got quite a bit of publicity were hiking at 177,000 FT elevation when they saw a
huge white spherical object hovering overhead they ran over to see what it
was at which point it disappeared but it was during this time that they were confronted by a humanoid figure they
said it was 4 feet tall almost robotic looking with a kind of cylindrical head and it began to Glide
towards them then levitate up and into this spherical object which promptly
darted away what's interesting about this case is they were able to snap a photograph
of this entity which you can see here it's not a great photograph but it's certainly interesting given that these
Witnesses are scientists and this case did get a lot of attention it was investig at by the
Indian space research organization as well as the Indian army who were quite
impressed with the case and took it very seriously here's another even more
recent case which occurred on October 1st 2015 when Farm Workers from the village
of kagal saw a red UFO drop from the sky and actually
land very quickly a humanoid figure emerged and came briefly towards the
witnesses then returned to the craft which took off it was then discovered
that some other villagers also saw a craft drop down to about 500 ft and they
said that they were able to see humanoid figures inside of it well how's that I
mean some of these cases are definitely unique outliers not your
average humanoid encounter by any means but super fascinating and it's been
going on for a long time that's no surprise ETS have been here forever I'm sure
there are far more encounters with just humanoids than I covered here but it certainly gives a good sort of
crosssection of what's going on with humanoids in India and now we move to our next
location which is by special request of zor nuke and zor nuke you asked me to
cover the birkshire mountains of Massachusetts turns out this is a fairly
large area including several cities so again I'm going to request you guys to please
limit yourself to one city it makes my job a lot easier but I did my best uh it
was hard because I couldn't cover each of the cities in this location so this
again is by no means comprehensive but I did find some very interesting cases
including a couple of onboard encounters that's mostly what I focused on here a few super interesting sightings
of course the very famous Tom Reed encounter which I suspect is are new cuz
what you wanted me to cover can't say for sure but I found another very interesting onboard case involving a
famous celebrity so hopefully you will find that fascinating as well again the
Burkshire mountains is a pretty large area containing many cities so it was difficult to investigate this one but I
did find some interesting incidents one occurred in 1954 and involves the provocative and
controversial talk show host Morton Downey Jr who since passed away but he
was hypnotized live on his show by UFO researcher Jean Mundy to recall an
episode of missing time at the time he was 20 years old and was driving through the birkshire mountains when he saw a
brilliant light his car stalled he felt felt a sense of electricity then he blacked out and he woke up shortly later
with a dreamlike memory of seeing this beautiful yellow light seeing really beautiful faces being laid out on a
table that's all he could really recall other than he was now missing about 40
minutes of time then live on the show he went under
hypnosis and I will just quote Morton directly this is his testimony retrieved under hypnosis he says I was removed to
the stage and hypnotized this is under hypnosis now in 1954 I was driving on
Boston Post Road I was a young kid I had to get to Boston for a convention it was
late at night I've been driving 2 and 1 half hours I'm outside of Hartford
Connecticut we don't have big roads we just have this two-lane Boston Post Road
it opens up to a three lane road and I'm driving along and there is a star to my
right and it's always right outside the window of my car 40 50 miles with this
star must be an airplane but this one is moving with me I'm driving past an
electric power plant and I'm still driving I've gone zigzagged and the star
is now in front of me moving away and out of my distant sight there's an
overpass I see this fog coming down over this overpass it must be a fog patch
it's right over the bridge I hit the the fog my lights are going down my car is
stopping by itself I turn over to the side so I can get off the road I'm in the dark except for this
gray pulsating light you have nothing to fear I better get out of my car I can't
open the door or window or vent the car won't start a Voice keeps
saying you have nothing to fear hair on my hands and head is standing up that's
got to be from the power plant but why all of a sudden my whole vehicle is
being picked up off the road I don't feel any motion I'm just being lifted off the road I don't see any faces I
don't feel any touch I keep hearing a voice you have nothing to fear
tremendous pain over my chest am I dying am I having a heart attack you have
nothing to fear I'm seeing fog I don't know how long it is but I have the
feeling that the car is being gently replaced on the road I see the pavement
and the swirling as the fog as it starts to pick up automatically my car starts
to go on my window rolls on I look at my watch it's now 10 minutes to two I leave
and I drive further up the road I'm tired I'm probably hallucinating when I check into the cabin I have to wake the
manager and the cabin his watch says one time my watch says 43 minutes minutes
less so that's what he recalled under hypnosis it's interesting because a
disclaimer appeared during this episode that says and I quote Mart does not
really believe he was on a UFO so he's backpedaling a little bit there but this
certainly does sound like an onboard UFO encounter now the next case is the very
famous Tom Reed case which has been covered extensively I would certainly refer people to check out Tom Reed
Direct ly because he is quite active in this field but I'll cover it briefly cuz
it's a amazing case it occurred one evening well there's actually several
incidents one evening in September 1966 Tom who was then 6 years old and his
threey yearold brother Matthew saw this weird light outside the window of their
bedroom from their home in the birkshire Hills suddenly without any idea how they
got there they found themselves outside uh in fact their mother said that they
looked almost entranced it was one year later in September 1967 it happened
again both Tom and his brother went missing while their mother Nancy frantically searched for them but events
came to a dramatic climax on September 1st 1967 when Nancy her mother Maran and the
two boys were driving along Highway 7 near a covered bridge you can see it here and suddenly this gigantic glowing
craft appeared overhead very close about 600 ft away all four of them felt
strangely immobilized as an unnatural silence enveloped them suddenly The
Crickets began chirping the UFO was gone and everything was back to normal except that Nancy was in the wrong seat Marian
was standing outside the car in the road Tom was left with vague memories of being in a large dark room laying on a
table seeing 5ot tall humanoids with an insect-like appearance hearing other
family members in there crying out now it's Tom says now we do remember being in what
looked like an airplane hanger we didn't stay in the car we were removed from the vehicle that's true where we were I
don't know so he's very careful in his interpretation of this but as it turned
out numerous people in the area were reporting UFOs at this same time in fact
the local radio station was flooded with calls from people seeing UFOs and this
no surprise became the Talk of the Town and when Tom Reed's family story came
out despite the corroboration from the many other Witnesses in this area they
were endlessly ridiculed to the point finally where they actually sold their home and their business and moved
away but since then then Tom Reed has continued to investigate and talk about
his encounter he did take and pass a polygraph test Tom story has appeared on
various television programs but was to his dismay somewhat sensationalized and
distorted uh he has worked hard to get the word out about this and in fact there is now a UFO Monument this is the
first of its kind commemorating the event and he is actually writing a book
to get the TR truth of what happened on record he refers to his encounter simply
as quote an offworld incident now there are other cases in this area there was
an article by Derek genelli in the newspaper which writes that on May 5
1988 Richard Wells was walking along Pleasant Street in the city of Lee in
the Burkshire mountains this was around 8:30 p.m. when he saw a bright light
flashing green blue and red he thought at first it might be a plane but it
wasn't moving and in fact it remained in view for about 45 minutes he saw it
again the next night and was unable to identify it and actually snapped a photograph and this is what prompted him
to call the Pittsfield airport local radio stations and newspapers and eventually reported it to a UFO Center
turns out he wasn't the only witness because a few days earlier police chief Michael belcom said the third station
received a call from a woman who lived in the North egremont Area and she said
that she saw a UFO hovering over Boyce Road now upon investigation officer
balcolm and another man did discover three equidistant patches of singed
vegetation off to the side of the road apparent Landing traces and another
sighting from 1973 comes from Harold I son who said that he was driving along
Route 7 in Stockbridge this was one evening in around 9:00 p.m. when he
noticed a light pacing his car and he he says it kept coming closer and
closer then it took off at super high speed in a couple of seconds he said it looked like quote two dinner plates put
together and as he says I'm a Believer so there you go that's the birkshire
mountains the Tom case is amazing he's still very active on the UFO circuit
he's glad he's putting out a book I'll be first in line to read that one because wow what an amazing series of
events and who knew that the Morton Downey Jr the talk show host apparently
had an onboard encounter even though he backpedal a little bit once he realized
what he was saying it certainly is interesting but now we move to the next
location I'm not sure if I mentioned this in the intro but this is one of the locations I am covering today Sacramento
California that's by special request of Danny this is a huge city capital of
California a half million people so again by no means
comprehensive but I found some super interesting encounters one that's
incredibly bizarre I mean wow this one case alone is worth the price of
admission I've never heard any anything like it but it appears to be legitimate but certainly unusual humanoid cases as
well Landings the whole deal UFOs are seen everywhere I'll say it again because it's true Sacramento's most
famous sighting by far is part of the very famous and controversial Airship
wave of the late 1890s so was almost 130 years ago on
November 17 1896 when crowds of people in Sacramento
saw a strange Airship moving over the city some people reported hearing voices
others said that they actually did see people the object does resemble today's blimps and Zeppelins and in fact
Zeppelins would be officially invented just a few years later this is an event
that has been widely covered so I'm not going to go in-depth into it uh but I do
wonder about this wave of sightings perhaps these were in fact blimps that
had not been revealed yet hard to say for sure but it's certainly an odd
event but activity really began in 1947 and in fact it was the summer of 1947
that an unprecedented superwave of UFO activity swept across the United States
and the world and two cases from Sacramento occurred right around the same time as the Roswell UFO crash in
July at 8 a.m. on July 5 Dr AK car and
his wife observed two glowing discs trailing each other at about 8 to 10,000
ft altitude over Sacramento was 4 days later at 1:45 p.m.
on July 9th that sevita Rosetta and her son Dempsey and several other
neighborhood children spent about 20 minutes watching a shiny disc-shaped
object perform amazing Maneuvers overhead that was an amazing UFO wave
and since then UFO activity has been occurring regularly the next Sacramento case I
found occurred on April 9 1950 an amateur astronomer Mr H Bak was
scanning the night sky at around 8:35 p.m. with a a small telescope when he
says he saw get this a massive Fleet of 5050 white objects all glowing white he
called out his friends and they all took turns watching these objects and after
they left they called the Sacramento be to report their amazing sighting couple
of years later this is an amazing event this is a multiple witness case which occurred on June 4
1952 when a Lady by the name of Zelma H Meek was in her Sacramento home and saw
a group of children outside gazing upward going outside she saw an orange
yellow glowing sort of k-shaped object hovering stationary in the
sky it then descended turned sharply changed directions and seemed to change
shape as it accelerated off into the distance now it turns out Zelma was a
supervisor at the Sacramento air defense filter Center but she did not report the
sighting out of fear of ridicule she says that while at her job she received
many reports of UFOs and she and the others who worked there felt that there
was little reason to report UFOs as no news was ever forthcoming from their
superiors about these reports that were consistently coming in and one month later on July 29 there
was another report which was in fact talked about by the air defense filter
Center who at this time said that they were in fact receiving about three
reports of UFOs per day this particular sighting was made by a
16-year-old boy by the name of Jerry spear who said that he saw two objects
at very low elevation said they were 20 ft tall about 40 ft long these were
solid objects each with three sets of two windows and they were darting up and
down and sideways in this non-conventional way and as Jerry says in his own words the thing looked like
two flattened tops that had been flattened out against each other the windows were square and the frames stuck
out the whole thing was covered with shiny metal so your typical UFO and
another witness was Miles M Meyers of 2425 Meadow Brook Road who said that on
that same night an object hovered directly over his house and then went straight
up very interesting and the sightings continued on August 2nd 1955 a
Sacramento resident reports his sighting of a quote flat and amber colored egg-shaped object which he said was
performing strange Maneuvers now he reported to the military who wrote and I
quote came up in South went to Southwest made a 90° turn came straight ahead and
climbed Straight Out of Sight now it's funny because Blue Book quote investigated this sighting and they
actually altered the details to make this report look like it was a plane and they declared it identified that's
Project Blue Book for you here's another case two years later November 6th 1957
2:30 a.m. truck driver Stanford M Carter was driving diving into Sacramento when
he saw a brilliant blue light over North Sacramento he thought for a brief moment
it might be a shooting star but it actually hovered in place and as he says it's different from everything I've ever
seen meanwhile other Witnesses were reporting seeing UFOs described as quote
egg-shaped bluish green and bright and solid here's a very interesting case a
typical Close Encounter of the second kind which comes from the saucerian bulletin was 3 days actually after the
above case on November 9 1957 about 15 minutes after midnight a man was driving
in Sacramento when his car engine and headlights failed looking up this is
when he saw an egg-shaped object about 150 to 200 ft long maybe 40 to 50 ft
wide with very sort of short delta-shaped Wings it was moving over
his car he said a blowed bright blue and left a sort of fluorescent trail behind it at the time there was a massive wave
of encounters sweeping across the country in fact that week Still Remains
one of the busiest in United States UFO history now this next case is a doozy it
is so strange this has to be one of the strangest UFO encounters on record and
it occurred to a 13-year-old paper boy by the name of Philip Wayne was 538 a on
July 11 1961 and Philip was delivering a stack of the Sacramento union newspapers to
Residents along the 3400 Evergreen Circle block of meadow
Meadowdale this is a neighborhood in Sacramento and I'll just let Philip describe in his own words what happened
this is what he told reporters and Military Officers Z says I reached my
hand over my head to throw a folded new paper and suddenly there was no paper in
my hand I thought I had missed and reached for a second paper the same
thing happened when the third paper was jerked from my hand I felt a suction but
heard no noise I looked up and saw two things that looked like flying saucers
one was larger than the other but were about 80 to 100 feet above the
ground and those newspapers were sewing straight up to those saucers the larger saucer was 50 ft across and
the smaller one was 40t across they were shiny aluminum and seemed to be standing
still now philli said that he could see what looked like weird pipes of different lengths sticking out from it
didn't get a good look at it because as he says I took off like a scared
bird uh he did return to the area as he says later I went back checking for the missing papers I counted my stack three
times three were missing I never found them so yeah he reported his experience
to Air Force officials who apparently took it seriously and told him that they would investigate needless to say Philip
did not hear back from them this next case from 1964 was reported to muon and
is one of the few humanoid accounts I could find from Sacramento the witness was waiting for
his father who worked at mlen Air Force Base when he saw an eight 18t wide 8T
High disc-shaped craft land in a field this field was filled with cows and was
located towards the North End of mlen Air Force Base this was nighttime but
the craft was so bright it lit up the area like daylight and moments later several
sized beings in uniforms exited and began to wander around the craft
they never went more than 150 ft away from it but they seem to show an interest in the cows in this
field now the next day the witness did read an article in the newspaper about animal mutilations and he wondered if
maybe that's why this UFO landed there though he didn't report seeing anything
like this these ETS just seem to show an interest in the cows so he wondered about it but certainly an interesting
case and here's another one this one occurred on February 6th 1970 it's an un
deniable UFO which was seen by Mr Fe Burkhart and his
wife it was 825 p.m. and they saw this object which was located in the section
of the sky near the constellation Orion and they watched as it made a long slow
curve across the sky then stopped in place flared bright yellow then Rose
steeply and proceeded to release four additional objects before climbing up
higher flaring up again and then disappearing they watched this for a good amount of time about five minutes
using binoculars they were so impressed that they called mlen Air Force Base and this
is when they learned that another witness had also just called the base to report apparently the same
object many cases in Sacramento here's a brief one which occurred on April 3rd
1975 when a mother and daughter said that they saw a UFO over
Sacramento they were leaving the city and it followed them all the way to their home in nearby G now we remained
over the city of G for about 2 and 1 half hours and was observed by several
other residents in G here's another case which got a lot of attention because there was a bunch of witnesses this
occurred on November 3rd 1981 when people over a wide area of Sacramento
observed UFOs one witness Tim Blancher said it was around 2:20 p.m. when he saw
quote an extremely bright and shiny object about 1800 to 2,000 ft this was
in the Northwest sky and as he says it was strange I never saw anything like it
before it shook me up now another couple from East Sacramento said that they
observed an object that looked oval and translucent here's a pretty recent case
involving an appearent UFO Fleet that's occurred on May 7 2010 and comes from K
Piper who reported his North Sacramento area sighting to the National examiner
and as he writes I saw 12 to 15 shiny objects in the sky the group of objects
moved slowly North by Northwest I watched them travel for about a minute and then all but one of the objects
vanished instantly the one remaining object moved back back in a South by
Southwest Direction directly over my head now he watched this object hover
over his head for about 2 minutes when it was joined by another object both of which then disappeared he called his
sighting quote epic now the most recent sighting I found is quite
impressive and this comes from a witness uh who says it was about a half
hour after midnight on February 21st 2018 and he decided to go to the local Jack
in the Box for a late night snack and this is when he saw an object appear out of thin air and hover over a building
about 300 ft away he reported it to muon he actually drew the object which you
can see here and as he says I didn't have time to think I was almost
dumbfounded at what I was looking at it had two blue lights that were parallel to each other the blue light followed
from the front of the craft to the the back and were on the sides of it they were bright and I saw this craft the
second it appeared before I could process what was happening it shot off in a strange light and disappeared this
case was researched by Valerie bko a muon field investigator who said and I
quote the witness was very shaken up over this experience he explained that
they teach you in school this stuff is not real if you talk about UFOs people
will label you as crazy unfortunately true so that's Sacramento and as you can
see it has the full range of Close Encounters pretty much from Close
Encounters of the first kind sightings second affecting the environment third humanoids being seen and so forth really
fascinating stuff and that one encounter with the newspaper boy wow never heard
anything quite like that I wonder about it certainly is fascinating and now we move to our next
and final location in this episode which is by special request of coconut this is
for you coconut and you requested that I take a look at Nova Scotia Canada again
this is not just a city this is a fairly large area accompanying including several cities so
again by no means comprehensive some really famous cases there of course the
Shag Harbor Uso case it's probably the most famous I'm just going to cover that
sort of not too much in depth because it's been covered very extensively by
other folks who are much more knowledgeable about it than I am but I did find some really cool cases and I
think you'll find it quite Illuminating certainly hope so there are plenty of interesting cases is from Nova Scotia
one of the earliest I found occurred on August 4 1950 when the crew of the ship marala were off the coast of Walton Nova
Scotia when an object appeared off the starboard bow it was traveling about 50
to 100 ft above the water very low and actually approached to within 1,000 ft
of the boat at which point it revealed itself to be a cylindrical shaped object about 10 ft in diameter was totally
silent shiny aluminum in appearance and was moving in this weird kind of churning
motion and finally accelerated off into the distance it was a report which actually caught the attention of
American Intelligence Officers who showed great interest in the event a
brief but I think important case from Halifax occurred at 8:32 a.m. on June 15
1952 when an army meteorological officer a trained Observer says that he saw a
100t wide silver disc moving at about 800 mph and ascending from about 5 to
8,000 ft altitude to 11 or 12,000 ft in less than 5 Seconds this maneuver of
course rules out this object being a balloon or any conventional craft that
we would know of now here is a rare humanoid case I found this in Albert rosal's book
The humanoids Among Us this occurred one evening in December 1953 When Miss Orie
of sherbrook was in her home and it was the middle of the night when somebody knocked on the door she asked who it was
but the only response was some harder knocks on the door at this point her dog jumped up went to the door to
investigate but quickly retreated and sat in the corner of the room terrified
and trembling that was odd needless to say Miss orphie was a afraid to answer
the door but she did go to her second story window and looked out at her porch and this is when she saw two quote
Indescribable Shadows moving away from the house a short time later she saw a big round blue green glowing object take
off from only about 300 ft away from her house she did call the police who
investigated and found broken bushes in the area where she said she had seen the
object take off and they told that it looked as if an object of enormous weight had landed there and crushed
these bushes a somewhat harrowing case involving a UFO at Sea involves actually
two separate boats who encountered a UFO near Seal Island in May of
1963 the first witness was Captain woodro Atwood of the fishing boat whichway in who said that they he and
his crew saw a small glowing yellow object off in the distance
suddenly this object became blood red in appearance and quickly approached the
boat to within 10050 ft and was radiating a heat that was so intense
that the captain could feel it right through the cabin windows one of the crewmen said that the heat was so
intense he thought it might cause the boat to burst into flames quite
frightening the object hovered overhead for about 5 minutes then moved off
Captain Atwood immediately made a radio announcement to any nearby vessels alerting them to the object and he got a
response he got a call from the captain of the boat racer who said that he and
his crew saw a quote large red ball of Light which passed so low over their
boat that it narrowly missed striking the Mast two years later in
1965 two young boys Kevin Davis and Gary Jardine of Spring Hill reported their
observation of a red dome-shaped craft complete with Port holes as they watched
it a weird bar-like instrument or device came out of the largest port hole
re-entered a second time and emerged again then smoke and Sparks came out and
as the craft ascended snow in the area on the ground was blown around and
bushes were actually flattened Nova scotia's most famous incident by far
really put no Nova Scotia on the map this occurred on October 4
1967 and this is when numerous Witnesses at chag Harbor saw an object descend
into the harbor and slowly sink beneath the waves this is an incredibly long and
complicated event in fact there's an entire book written on this case by Chris Styles and Don Ledger detailing
this days long UFO encounter I mean when on for almost a week as military search
for this object it's incredibly well documented our government documents
verifying that this incident did take place a lot of witnesses it's exceedingly strange and far too long to
present here also Ledger and Styles have covered it extensively so I would refer
anyone interested in this event to check out their incredible Research into this
undeniable Uso case probably of the most famous Uso cases in the world certainly
in Canadian history here's a brief UFO landing case which was reported in the newspapers it's quite interesting though
the witness is Percy McBride of Kenan Nova Scotia who says that at 2 a.m. on
November 29 1967 he was camping next to a lake when
he saw a quote Strang looking object it came from the Eastern Sky passed by him
came back and landed on a forested hill nearby he was close enough to hear it
making a strange kind of warbling sound and he said it was flashing all sorts of
colored lights the actual structure of the craft was white he was very curious he got up he approached it to within a
quar mile he estimates that it was about as big as a car not huge but once he got
close to it he shouted out to it who are you there was no answer so he repeated
his question at which point the object promptly took off with a loud howling
noise this frightened him he was afraid it might return so he went back to his camping spot and put out the campfire
here's another interesting Uso account from Nova Scotia which occurred on
September 1st 1968 at around 4:30 p.m. there were four
Witnesses all young boys David Taylor age 14 his friend David Smith age 15
Gregory Kavanaugh 12 and Peter blakney age 11 they were on the corn Wallace
River Dyke when they saw this sort of black disc-shaped object hovering very
low about 100 fet right above the river they ran up to it I mean they're only a
few feet away from it although I mean it is 100t up over the river so they could
now say that this was 15 ft in diameter about 6 ft thick and they watched this
thing hover right over the river for about 10 minutes they said it was oscillating in the air spinning like a
top made no sound whatsoever and after 10 minutes dropped down into the river
without even a splash and just moved off with the speed of the current a very odd
and interesting multi- witness case moving along the next case occurred 2 years later October 5 1970 when 16year
old Paul Scott was just walking to school in Truro and this is when he saw
an orange yellow and green object he says this was the size of a small house flying overhead and emitting a whining
sound and what looked like white smoke it terrified the horses in a nearby Field his mother saw it too now this did
get some attention and NASA officials reportedly heard about it and said it was just a cloud of barium
gas but this is contradicted by the Canadian Armed Forces radar at sheerwater who said that they made
contact with a quote solid stationary unidentified object this was around the
same time early in the morning this next case comes from researcher Don Ledger he's covered this
area quite well a good researcher this is an interesting animal reaction case
was 6:15 p.m. on November 8th 1973 as Joan scoffield her husband and their
four children observed D two glowing red lights flying at Treetop level slowing
down speeding up and circling around the area in fact these objects were in view
for a full 15 minutes and during this whole time the family Dog exhibited
quote great agitation another interesting animal
reaction case occurred two months later on January 6 1974 of course this is Nova
Scotia was 11:30 p.m. when Carl Nicholson was babysitting and he heard
his dog barking outside looking outside he saw an object with blue yellow green
and red lights all in a row hovering and then apparently Landing behind some
trees he watched this for about an hour and was oppressed enough to call the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and they showed interest in his case he was interviewed by an officer who apparently
took the report very seriously less than a year later later July 16
1974 Ernest bugley and his wife and two others saw four very bright objects
hovering and darting over the Amhurst marshes one of the objects remained high
in the sky while three others which were blue in color they spun around and swirled
around towards the ground and would dart back up maneuvering like this for over an hour before disappearing now here's a
more recent case July of 1996 a pilot and police officer a good
witness was flying with his father-in-law and son at about 3500 FT
elevation from Waterville to Prince Edward Island they were over the cape
baladan area when they saw a 60ft wide chromik metallic sphere which was pacing
their aircraft about 2 mi away and 500 ft lower in elevation about 3,000
feet now this is when the pilot decided to bank his plane a Piper Cherokee to
get a better look at this object at this point the object immediately darted away to a distance of
about 20 miles now appearing only as a bright dot at which point it disappeared
but this really impressed the pilot cuz as he says I got a sick feeling when I saw the thing I knew right then that
this was not natural or man-made he said it gave him more fear than he's ever felt while dealing with some pretty
violent disputes as a police officer now the final case in this little compilation is quite a bizarre case of a
UFO over a graveyard I actually did a whole episode on UFOs over graveyards I
covered this one briefly but I think bear is repeating this was investigated by Eugene frisan and involves a
16-year-old paper boy by the name of Jeff this was at glaz Bay and he was
going by the Greenwood Cemetery on Dominion Street around 6: a.m. on
January 24 2000 this is when he suddenly heard a
whining sound and saw this dark kind of triangular-shaped object moving
overhead this is a quite small object it was very close only a few feet away he
said it couldn't have been more than 9 ft High 5T long and it was moving just above the ground kind of following the
cont tour of the ground said it made a few turns it was very low as low as the
Tombstones themselves this whole sighting was very brief maybe about 5 to
10 seconds but the witness became quite frightened and he fled the area and as
he did he heard these strange scuffling sounds behind him as though someone or
something was following him and that was pretty much the end of the sighting but there were some weird After Effects his
watch alarm which had set for 5:40 a.m. went off at 6:30 a.m. he does not know
how that happened also within hours of the sighting he says small red raised
and painful blisters appeared on his forehead cheek and chest these were
verified by his family and another thing he apparently may have had missing time
because he noticed that he was 45 minutes late finishing his route which
didn't make any sense given the brevity of his sighting another strange thing that he
thought might be connected was that just prior to this event he had a week-long series of unusual nightmares of his
home's roof being ripped off by the wind hard to say whether that's connected or
not but he thought it was worth mentioning also perhaps connected or important is not far from this area is a
reserve coal mine and the glaze Bay plant which actually produced heavy water for Atomic
plants the investigator Eugene frisan lives near this area and he also reports
several sightings of his own in this same area over the past few years so
there you go that's Nova Scotia Canada how interesting are these cases
humanoids Landings a UFO in a graveyard that was a really compelling case of
course the very famous shag Harbor incident wow amazing could
do an entire episode on just that case alone so thanks very much for referring
that case coconut or that location I hope you found it interesting but that's it for today
again if you guys want me to cover your hometown send it my way I'll do my best
you'll have to be patient because there's a long list of locations to cover and again please limit yourself to
one specific City or something along those lines because I just can't I can't do an
entire country uh it's just too much work I mean honestly each location on
Earth you could probably write an entire book on but I'm going to do my best I find this super interesting I always
learn something so thank you thank you thank you it's amazing to me that not
only are UFOs being seen everywhere but they're landing and humanoids are there and people are being taken on board and
there's the entire range of evidence just goes to show we have a lot still to
learn about what's going on here so that's our episode for today once again
