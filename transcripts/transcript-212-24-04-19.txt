STRANGE HUMANOIDS AROUND THE WORLD: TEN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS
Apr 19, 2024

Summary:
Apr 19, 2024
There are many different kinds of strange humanoids being reported by people all over the world, and it’s been happening for a long time. It’s definitely not just grays! In fact, the variety of ET types is far more numerous than most people realize. This video presents ten cases from across the world, spanning five decades, from the 1950s to the 1990s. Many involve multiple witnesses and different forms of evidence. But most fascinating are all the amazing kinds of ETs.

BROWN-SKINNED MIDGET ETS. One afternoon in the Fall of 1957, a 15-year-old boy was working in the fields south of the small town of Ejstrupholm, Denmark when a metallic craft landed just 100 feet away. To his utter shock, two 3-foot-tall brown-skinned ETs wearing transparent helmets emerged. After a few minutes, they returned to the craft, which took off. The witness was so amazed, he told almost nobody.

LOVERS LANE ALIENS. Late one evening in the Fall of 1966, a young couple drove to an isolated location outside of Rockford, Illinois to enjoy each other’s company in private. Without warning, a bright light appeared overhead. They quickly pulled a U-turn to flee the area, but before they could get away, they saw two gray figures with big black eyes staring back at them. It was an experience they would never forget.

THE ETS IN MELON FIELD. Around dusk on September 12, 1971, Juan Rodriguez Dominguez, who worked as a guard for the giant El Lunarejo melon farm in Aznalcollar, Spain, got the shock of his life when a massive, silver, torpedo-shaped craft landed a short distance away. Dozens of tiny figures wearing uniforms emerged. When Juan confronted them, the ETs chased him, shooting paralyzing lights rays at him.

NUCLEAR RESEARCHER HUMANOID ENCOUNTER. On the night of June 29, 1973, a nuclear researcher/professor was driving with his wife south of Chalk River, Ontario, Canada when they noticed a star-like object pacing their car. Soon it came closer, revealing itself to be a spherical craft with portholes, and through them they could see humanoid figures. And it crossed the road right in front of their car.

HUMANOID INVESTIGATES GRAVESITE. On the evening of July 23, 1977, a family in Lindley, New York were shocked to see multiple UFOs, and then little humanoids running around their backyard. They watched it do strange things to a gravestone nearby. The witnesses finally called the police and the UFOs and humanoids quickly left. But this was just the beginning of a weeks-long series of incredible encounters.

THE ETS IN THE FLYING BOX. One Summer evening in 1978, an anonymous gentleman was walking his dog near his home in Beeston, England when he saw something he could hardly believe: a box-shaped craft floating just above the rooftops. Most amazing, inside he saw several 10-foot-tall skinny figures wearing strange jumpsuits. A few of them saw the witness and waved at him before slowly moving away.

ETS OFFER CAKE. On the evening of December 3, 1979, teen-ager Lilli-Ann Karlsson was taking a walk in the park near her home in Vastervick, Sweden. Suddenly paralyzed, she found herself confronted by a craft in the field right next to her. Two ETs emerged and began to float towards her. They were 5 feet tall, white and glowing. They approached her, holding a piece of what looked like chocolate cake.

THREE LITTLE FLOATING ALIENS. Around dusk on January 12, 1983, Ed Eggen (pseudonym) and his two young sons were shocked to see a little bald man wearing a gray jumpsuit outside their home in Pine Township, Indiana. They ran outside to investigate. Seconds later, they noticed a second figure, and then a third. They approached within feet of them before all three figures converged and darted off into the sky.

THE GLOWING GIANT. Late in the evening of March 6, 1983, Madame Fauquembergue was in her home in Pas-de-Calais, France when she noticed a strange glowing figure moving around outside her home. Looking more closely, she saw it was 7 or 8 feet tall and wearing a silver jumpsuit. Earlier that evening, she and her family had been puzzled when the entire house lit up with light.

THE SHRUGGING GRAY. It was about 2:00 am on July 21, 1991, when 3 young girls decided to go outside and jump on the trampoline in the backyard of their home in a small town in central Missouri. They all saw a strange light, and moments later, a 4-foot-tall gray figure approached them. The girls fled into their home, but the gray then began to stare at them through the window, and kept doing for a period of hours.

These ten cases provide a small sample of the huge number of cases taking place across the planet. These cases show unique aspects and corroborating similarities. The evidence includes landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, and more. Each case provides another piece of the puzzle, and shows us that we are not alone. Humans are just one of many types of intelligent life in this vast universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called strange humanoids around the world 10 eyewitness accounts I love
talking about those humanoids there's so many different kinds so many interesting interactions that people have it's been
taking place for so long so yeah that's the theme of today's show I've chosen 10
cases of course all over the world mostly the United States but one from Canada one from England France Denmark
Sweden Spain so a pretty wide geographical area and of course
stretching over a long period of time in fact five decades cases from the 50s all
the way up through the 1990s so some older accounts and some modern ones but all involving humanoids
of different kinds many involving well most involving multiple eyewitnesses and of
course a wide variety of evidence these humanoid cases I think have so much to teach us pretty sure you haven't heard
about most of these cases but we will see and let's start with our first case
which I call brown skinned ETS I've had a number of people ask me why
aren't there any ETS with darker skin well of course there are and there's quite a few of them so I wanted to to
feature a case just to reinforce that this case took place in the fall of
1957 in a little town called estol Denmark and it's quite an interesting
case that remained hidden for many years until being brought forth by
researchers this case was investigated by researcher XP Madson and was
published in the November December 1975 issue of the Danish magazine UF neat or
UFO news it was a case that actually remained hidden for many years until
researchers Tracked Down the witness who at the time of his encounter was a 15-year-old boy the incident occurred
one day around 2 to 300 p.m. again in the fall of 1957 as the witness was collecting grain
in a field just a mile or so south of the small village of
estu now you can see the field here it was a cloudy day and as he worked he had
the sudden and strange sensation that he was being watched turning around he was
amazed to see a saucer-shaped craft parked in a field about 100 ft away
pretty close he says there were two very short people standing next to it looking right at him now he describes this craft
is metallic gray oval with a KOA on top and it wasn't huge a about 6 ft tall 8
ft wide and it was resting on three Landing legs each about 3 ft long and a
half foot thick but even more amazing of course were the two strange humanoids
who the witness said did look pretty much like us humans except that they were only about 3T tall he said they had
brown skin and they were wearing skintight shiny dark green jumpsuits
which covered them from the neck down and including their hands he says it was weird because there were no buttons
zippers or any features of any kind on the suits but on their heads they wore
large transparent Fishbowl type helmets with what looked to him like antenna
attached to them sweeping down towards the rear of their head now the witness was absolutely shocked and after
watching it for a few minutes he started to become a little nervous so nervous that he began to look around for rocks
to throw at these little figures and defend himself should they approach the next thing he knew these
two little ETS turned towards each other then there was a brilliant flash of light and they were gone and almost
instantly the craft in the field took off obliquely going upwards and in
perfect silence and was gone in seconds now looking where the landing legs of
The Craft had rested on the ground the witness did see that the vegetation there had been flattened
but he was so shocked and in complete disbelief about what he had seen I mean he almost didn't believe his own eyes he
said and he was afraid of being ridiculed if he should talk about it so
he told nobody but his closest Family a few years after this occurred a
researcher from the Scandinavian UFO information organization did hear rumors
about the sighting but wasn't able to track down the witness however 15 years later later in
1972 an audience member of a UFO lecture in the town of viram actually knew about
the case and connected the witness to researchers and that's how we finally
learned about it now that is a single witness case but it's super interesting
the witness did get a very close up look at the ETS there was also apparent
Landing traces it's a shame that it wasn't investigated more thoroughly
but it's a very interesting close-up en encounter which again shows that ETS
come in all different shapes sizes and of course skin colors should be no
surprise just looking at all the different variations we have here on Earth same is true for the ETS and
here's another case which shows that I call this one Lovers Lane aliens it's
interesting because there's quite a few cases of people who are out you know having a little bit of a good time out
there on a private little road somewhere in a rural area usually but yeah a
number of cases of people who see ETS while out there on the road with their
boyfriend or girlfriend or what have you so this case took place in the fall of
1966 in a little rural area outside of Rockford Illinois and it's quite a
fascinating case this case comes from an anonymous woman whose initials are LK
and she reported her encounter in a Written Letter almost two decades after it happened and she did speak with
researchers as well but it took her a long time to report it because as she
says I have tried to block this out in order to live as sane and normal a life
as I can I'm married to a respectable attorney now the incident in question
occurred late one fall evening in 1966 again in Rockford Illinois LK and her
boyfriend wanted to make out and they decided to drive to a private rural
location kind of a lovers lane type situation where they hoped nobody would see them which is often what they did
when they wanted to be alone and intimate as LK writes when we parked we
always made sure that there would be complete privacy so we wouldn't be interrupted or a policeman wouldn't be
coming along so they found a gravel road about a mile off of a paved Road and
they were enjoying each other's company when a brilliant light distracted them
and as LK says the only reason we looked up was because of the sudden bright
light the light was very bright like when someone is welding it hurt my eyes
all we wanted to do was get out of there I started the car and we drove across an
old metal Bridge only to discover that it was a dead end the road went into
Farm Fields so I turned the car around and stepped on the gas we had to go
right past where we had been parked now when they saw this light they said it appeared to be coming down
towards Treetop level and now passing this exact location where they had seen
this painfully bright white light they saw something else to apparent aliens
standing side by side looking right back at them as LK says I saw two gray
figures with large slanted eyes and with square Insignia near the heart area I
didn't feel threatened at the time of the sighting as much as I wanted to flee the area I felt safe near it so she felt
felt that that was kind of an odd reaction but despite this of course they did drive off they did notice a couple
of other things as LK says the hair on my arms and head felt like it was
standing on end now they also both noticed a very strong pungent odor which
they said was quote super metallic like sulfur or
iron when speaking with the researcher years later the witness according to the
researcher showed quote obvious relief she did break up with her
boyfriend 2 years later but kept in touch and as LK says we will never
forget what happened and I've never had any other experiences here we have
another example of a witness keeping their experience secret for a very long
time simply out of fear of ridicule such a shame most people are not reporting
their encounters which again means any estimate of how many cases there are like these it's far more than we think
that is clear cuz here's another case there are so many cases like this you guys it's
unbelievable so many that I think it's absolutely undeniable that these things are taking place because a lot of these
cases show remarkable commonalities and similarities little details that you
couldn't make up and here's a really wonderful case probably my favorite in
this bunch I call this one the ETS in a melon field and and this is a very
unusual case which took place on September 12 1971 in the little town of asnal kalar
Spain this is not a huge area 8,000 people or so certainly less back then a
lot of melons are grown in southern Spain and this one involves a case in
which a UFO landed yeah right in the middle of a field of melons a huge melon
farm and some very interesting things happened in this particular case the
main witness in this case is Juan Rodriguez Dominguez an older gentleman
who was employed as the guard of a vast melon patch known locally as el lunar
rejo this is located not far from the town of azal kalar in sevil
Spain he was there like any other day staying near his Hut in the center of
this Farm and it was just getting dark around dusk when he saw a humongous
oval-shaped silver object Dro down from the sky and settle in for a landing on
one of the hills of the melon farm not far away from him it reminded him
somewhat of a bus locally known as The Traveler this bus ran a regular route
between the towns of Alara to sevil now onean had really given no
thought to UFOs or visitors from space throughout his life but it was clear to
him at this point that this was a spaceship of some kind he said it was shaped like a missile and its shiny
metallic surface was actually glinting in the Rays of the Setting Sun now
feeling a strong wave of fear at the high strangeness of this object he
quickly made sure he had his gun and held tightly on to his double barreled
shotgun he carried this with him during his job and he got it ready quote just
in case it was necessary now seconds after this very large object landed two small doors
located at either end of this massive craft opened up two little ramps
extended to the ground and a crowd of little quote dwarves came out and each
of them was dressed in this strange one piece blue uniform and they were tiny
little things only about 3T tall Juan did notice that something covered their
faces which prevented him from seeing what they looked like now he's not really thinking ETS that wasn't part of
his Paradigm he and he was wondering could they be military was this some kind of attack but why had they landed
in this remote melon patch and there were about 20 of these little guys outside the ship wandering
around and then at this point he noticed that a quote Regiment of the little
beings moving in two rows were approaching an artisian well this well
supplied water to irrigate the farm now he was now dismayed and knowing that he
was the only witness he really just felt like he had no choice and he decided to
stand up and reveal himself instantly at this point one of the little men pointed
something like a powerful flashlight at onean which he said blinded dazzled him
almost making him fall to the ground and immediately and to his shock six of the
beings started to walk very quickly towards his Hut firing periodic bursts
of light from their flashlights or whatever these things were which he said produced eye irritation and an
unbearable pain in his head so now he was terrified he immediately started to
run away towards the town and he said he had gone about 600 ft when he turned
around to check and see what was happening and he was not happy to see
that two of these little dwarves were following right behind him still aiming their flashlights on him so he quickly
turned back around and kept running away not daring to look back in fact he ran the entire way back to town which was
almost 2 miles he ran up to a group of about a dozen people now again he was
kind of an older man but very very well known very respected by the people of the town and they were shocked to see
him stumbling and falling getting up and running in absolute Terror and screaming
out the traveler The Traveler so a crowd of people quickly
formed around him they helped him stand up they tried to get him to calm down it
took some effort to pry his hands loose from his shotgun and get him to explain what had happened so Juan fearfully then
spe Spilled Out his story and seeing Juan's Panic State and knowing him to be
an honest man nobody doubted his story by then the chicaros family who they
were the co-owners of the melon farm they immediately ran towards the location with a number of other people
and when they reached the spot that onean had described the craft and the humanoids of course were gone but as
they examined the area they found dozens of sets of tiny Footprints which they
said look like they were made by small booties they were particularly numerous around the little well
there so everyone there was very much impressed that the events had occurred exactly as one had described and
together they made a pcta to keep quiet about it knowing how incredible it would sound to
Outsiders however the next day Juan apparently unable to get this incident
out of his mind reported it to the Civil guard they asked him why he had not used
his gun and he replied simply if I had shot they would have surrounded me and
at this hour I wouldn't be able to tell you anything now this case was published in
Iker hz's Spanish language book en Quant a which means UFO
encounters just for your information Spain is the world's second biggest
melon exporter and many of these melons are grown in this area and the City of
asna colar where this occurred would later become infamous when a nearby Dam
burst releasing about 5 million cubic meters of acidic mine tailings into the
nearby River agrio and other rivers polluting a pretty wide area what a case
that was I mean I can only imagine seeing that many each
being chased by them them having them shoot their little ray guns pew pew pew
at you uh I mean I don't mean to make light of it that was clearly a very scary experience for the witness and I'm
glad that he had the support of the people who loved and trusted him and of
course there were Landing traces footsteps and so forth Footprints I should say what a wild case and uh
here's another one I mean just case after case I call this next one nuclear
researcher humanoid encounter this is a multiple witness case which took place on June 29
1973 not far from chalk River this is in Ontario Canada and what's interesting to
me about this case is that these Witnesses did see this UFO and humanoids
very close up it was unmistakable but to me the most interesting thing is who the witness is this case comes from
Canadian researchers weo hovil and Don dandere the witnesses have requested
anonymity but I'll call them for here Chuck and his wife hie now at the time
of his encounter Chuck was an engineering professor and a former assistant Dean at McGill University in
Montreal a former RAF pilot and when it came to UFOs he described himself as
quote an openminded skeptic so a good witness a smart guy now this is where it
gets interesting because over the summer he had been doing nuclear research at the laboratory of atomic energy of
Canada Limited now on the night of July 29
1973 he was returning from the nuclear company where he had done this research
to continue his professorship at the University he was driving with his wife hie and they were had just left the city
of chalk River and were approaching Ottawa when hiy noticed an unusually
bright star-like object kind of close to the Horizon and as she watched this
staric object seemed to cross over to the left it became brighter and larger
than the other stars in the sky now she watched this for quite some time almost an hour when it suddenly seemed to move
towards them and became increasingly brilliant and this was when she pointed
it out to her husband Chuck they were now on Route 17 between Ottawa and
Montreal and the sphere was now taking on an appearance that made it look very
close to the Ground Round reflective like a solid object hi had the
impression that this object whatever it was was inter in a nearby Reservoir that
was illuminated by large flood lights so they're driving along and suddenly become parallel to this object and it
was quite close about 100 ft away they could now clearly see that it was a solid globe and there was nothing
underneath it hie was staring at it when it suddenly shot a horizontal beam of
light and at the same time she saw the central section appear to slide back
revealing three large portoles and this is when she realized that the light coming from this object
was coming from these portoles now the object itself was blue white and the
light coming from the portoles was yellow and she turned to Chuck and said
it looks like a flying house now to the amazement of them both
the object started to move directly towards them and they were even more amazed to look through these port holes
and see three humanoid Silhouettes looking down right at them the object
moved right in front of their car moving from left to right and then quickly disappeared in about 10 seconds there
was light traffic on the road but weirdly none of the other cars seemed to pay any attention to this
object later they did try reporting this sighting to officials even submitting their drawing of the object with these
little humanoids and they were told that they had seen a quote dc9 aircraft
approaching Upland airport now researcher weido hooville
says and I quote the NRC explanation was utterly absurd and naive and the
Witnesses were very dis dissatisfied with it I bet I am too now researcher
weo hovell was intrigued very much that this object came so close to the
witnesses is and as he says so here is a mystery within a mystery why did the
object disappear after its obvious show of Interest I mean this object was close
enough that the occupants had to know they were being observed once again we
see authorities absolutely paying no attention no serious attention to a
person citing issuing debunking explanations without even researching it
it's such a shame but yeah to me the most interesting aspect of that particular encounter is
the fact that the witness is a professor a scientist a nuclear researcher we know
from firsthand contacte accounts that ETS are very concerned about our use of nuclear material in any capacity and I
wonder if this was an intentional display showing themselves off to someone who perhaps they knew was very
knowledgeable about nuclear materials of course that is pure speculation but I
have to wonder given that this is a very common message given to contact by the
ETS and now we move to another really unusual case this one has got quite a
few Witnesses animal reactions physiological effects lanting
traces and it took place over a period of days and some really other unusual
effects as well it's a really remarkable case which I call humanoids investigate
a grave site this took place again over a period of days weeks really from about
July 23rd to the beginning of August this was in
1977 in the very very small town of Lindley New York and I think you'll
agree this is a case worthy of more attention this case came to the attention of UF researcher Alan Henry
when he was monitoring the center for UFO studies police hotline and he actually flew to the location and
interviewed the witnesses personally it was around 1 a.m. on July 23rd
1977 when Monica aged 26 and her niece Janine aged 13 had arrived home in the
small town of Lindley a very small town after attending a stock car race event
they noticed that their little pet dend cubby started barking they thought that
there might be kids in the area who had recently been suspected of thievery so
she let out her other larger dog a German Shepherd who didn't seem to react in any way however going back inside
both Monica and Janine looked out the window and noticed about 11 or 12 star-like objects moving around in all
directions all seemed quite low and had a weird Halo surrounding them then they
saw one bright light suddenly appear right over a small hill about 900 ft
away at the same time they heard a quote whoosing noise and this was followed by
sounds like stones falling in the nearby Creek bread and looking in that area they saw
two 4ft tall figures in front of a tree and it was weird cuz these figures
seemed to be floating up and down they were watching these two figures when suddenly more appeared several of them
carrying what looked like flashlights and these figures started wandering all over the creek bed area also onto the
neighbors's property now these figures appeared to be wearing dark divers suits with a sort
of greenish tint and they had glowing green belts and all of them were moving
in this weird floating hopping motion Monica was about to call her
sister Janine's mother but Janine said no let's not do that these figures will
probably leave but they didn't in fact events escalated when
suddenly a red light which they described as being rectangular suddenly approached the
creek and then receded back something very weird happened this point both
Janine and Monica reported a sudden headache and both Witnesses then saw
something they could hardly believe one of these figures appeared on a small hill a short distance away and began to
illuminate a large lone Tombstone a gravestone that was sitting on a hill
just beyond the creek on the neighbor's property the figure walked or rather
floated away from it then returned and lit up the tombstone again at which
point this Tombstone which you can see here it's quite heavy and large it began
to rise up into the there and sway back and forth so both Monica and Janine now
saw a taller figure standing on the hill and this was weird this taller figure
started calling out with an ooh ooh sound at which point all the figures
approached the tall one for just a few moments and then scattered back out into the field without warning one of the
figures appeared right beneath the secondstory bedroom window and as soon
as Monica and Janine saw him this figure quickly crouched down apparently to hide
from view ironically this posture brought his face closer to his glowing
belt which allowed Janine to see that he had sort of a normal human looking face
she couldn't be sure that's what she thought she saw now to their shock this
figure walked right up to the back door and began to jiggle the door handle and they also heard several more of these SE
figures walking around behind the house now this was enough to get Monica to
call her sister and then the police it was now 3:45 a.m. so this had been going
on for well over 2 hours the witnesses did notice another thing whenever a car
would drive by they would duck down their house was right along the highway there the police arrived shortly later
but just before they arrived the figures fled the area the glowing objects Rose
back up into the sky and took on a star-like appearance more family members arrived
everyone quickly searched the area and they did find something interesting there were some crushed cucumber plants
some oddly split rocks little holes in the ground they looked at the tombstone
and it showed no evidence of having been moved they did however find what looked like three odd Footprints in a straight
line right along the driveway each was about 8 in long and had no Treads or
heel marks so certainly not a normal footprint now as I said both Monica and
Janine did get a headache when this red light appeared and it persisted for about two days and not only that they
experienced dry throats ringing of the ears and sluggishness and both were really
shocked to learn that this encounter had endured for about 3 hours cuz they both
felt it was closer to one hour now investigators did contact the
local FAA near Elmyra who had no information to offer also the next door
neighbors didn't see anything although they were up late later Janine did agree
to undergo hypnosis but no new details emerged however events were still in
progress cuz it was just a few days later on the evening of July 25 and 26
about 6 miles from where Monica and Janine lived a man by the name of Donald
heard a noise at his door and looking outside he saw a 4ot tall humanoid
wearing a jumpsuit standing near his porch presumably these are the same guys
Monica and Janine saw so Donald grabbed a flashlight and a
gun and stepped out on the porch he aimed his flashlight at the humanoid
which illuminated the humanoid but it also illuminated a craft hovering over a
nearby tree and instantly a beam of Light Came From The Craft and struck
Donald knocking him back he said so he ran into the house dazed he said he felt
like his head was going to explode his whole body felt numb his ears were ringing and he was experiencing strange
cramps in his body and so was his wife who had remained inside they looked outside and they saw
about six or seven UFOs and several humanoids now moving all over their
property and at one point apparently on the roof they heard something they could
also hear these figures making a strange chattering noise and it went on all night until about 5 a.m. at which point
suddenly the humanoids and UFOs left the next morning they did find Footprints
and a displaced metal Lou on the roof things were still going on because
it was a couple of days later July 28 Janine's father was in the area and said
he saw a bright orange domed disc moved right over the property at about 1:00
a.m. it hovered briefly and then disappeared and a few days later on
August 1st the UFOs and humanoids returned to Monica's property and both Monica and Janine saw
about six or seven of these same short humanoids with these weird glowing green
belts they took a flashlight and shown them shown it at one of these humanoids
who promptly disappeared but he immediately reappeared when they stopped shining the flashlight on him so seeing
these humanoids they quickly woke up Monica's father Clifford who said he was admittedly frightened by what he saw
didn't want to take a closer look he wouldn't tell investigators that he saw any humanoid but he did admit to
seeing weird lights which he said were quote different from anything that he had seen before now both Monica and
Janine reported that this weird headache came back again now two weeks later on
August 14 1977 their neighbor their neighbor Barbara said she was actually
followed for one mile back to her home watched this light for like three
hours and afterwards s suffered burning watering eyes a sore throat and a
headache just like the other Witnesses and finally events apparently ended on
August 17 Janine stepped outside their home was around 10:30 p.m. and saw a
glowing object emit two tiny green orbs which Janine says raced right up to her
stopped about 2 to 3 feet away she actually swung her arms at them in
defense trying to swat them away ran back inside then sat down and promptly
but thankfully temporarily forgot about them just acted as if nothing had happened and it was at this time that
the activities seemed to stop now researcher Alan Henry after looking into all of these events says
needless to say these cases still require a lot more
investigation now when you have that many witnesses seeing humanoids seeing
UFOs reporting strange physiological effects watering eyes headaches all
these Footprints and holes in the ground uh a guy being knocked over by a beam of
light I mean how much evidence do you need to say that there's something to these cases it always kind of confuses
me and puzzles me when people say well there's no evidence for this no hard evidence there is and certainly all
these w es who have these experiences will tell you so but we are all victims
of this brutal ruthless well-funded well orchestrated UFO coverup that has been
specifically designed to make UFO Witnesses look like fools idiots the
explanation for for all these accounts has always been they're explainable by
hoaxes hallucinations or misperceptions but we can see clearly that that is
simply not true it's time to move past skepticism there's far far far too many
cases to ignore and here is another case
this one took place in beaston this is in Leeds England I call this one the ETS
in the flying box I wanted to feature this case because it's a very unusual
UFO some very unusual humanoids it is mostly a single witness case that so
apparently there was another witness unfortunately this other witness was not interviewed so I think we have to
consider this a single witness case but the witness did see this object very
close up and he's absolutely convinced it's unusual he was interviewed by
professional researchers so I think it's a genuine case it took place in the
summer of 1978 again in beaston this is in Leeds England this case from British
researcher Mark birdal was published in the Yorkshire UFO society's EOS journal
and as Mark bdsa writes reports of actual figures on board should interest
all investigators one such case which has attracted a fair amount of interest
is the sighting of a UFO which was seen in the beaston area of leads the witness who requires anonymity
requires total confidentiality reported the case to us a few weeks ago Mr s has not spoken to
his wife about the incident because she would think that he is unstable she's
also quite ill by the way but it was around 9900 p.m. again in the summer of
1978 that Mr s was walking his dog in the beaston area and looking up was
greeted with an incredible sight as he says I couldn't believe my eyes floating
at very low level was a huge kind of rectangular shaped object black in color
except for a long clear section of what appeared to be seven paneled Windows
along one side of the object the wind has heard no noise whatsoever there were
no lights on this object itself but the glass looking Windows did show the interior of the craft was illuminated
with a sort of soft muted light as Mr s says I couldn't understand how such a
massive object stayed in the air but even more amazing than the object itself
was that the witness could see several figures in the window now he said he had to really meditate to recall exactly how
many and what they looked like but he said that there were at least nine of them seven of the figures could be seen
in the first window at the front section of the object another could be seen in
the third window and another in the sixth window towards the rear and after carefully thinking about it the witness
estimates that these figures were extremely tall I mean he's estimating about 10 ft he says the figures in the
first window were actually waving at him now just so you know he was pretty close
to this object close enough to get a good look at him he said that they were all wearing one piece white uniforms
with a straight collar that went right up to the the chin they seem to have faces that he described as quote hard
but he said that they look like normal humans they all had short hair that was brushed back now it did take
investigators a few interviews to obtain all these details but Mr s said that he
watched this object in absolute amazement and realizing how unusual it was he looked around to see if anyone
else was on the street to verify what he saw and as he says I ran to the end of
the street to gain the attention of the other man but yeah this was so close it was
actually right in front of a church steeple the man as this witness says actually looked up and could see this
object but strangely did not seem to pay it much notice some of the folks at the
EOS organization were a little bit unsure about the veracity of the case but as Mark birdal says the witness did
talk to them several times providing all these details which remained
consistent so yeah those sound like some unusually tall ETS to say the least of
course it's clear that the witness is estimating their height but he was the one who was there and if he saw this low
enough I mean in front of a church steeple this is a pretty good view so
it's clear that he is absolutely convinced he saw this close enough to
determine that these ETS were extremely tall an amazing case I think and here is
another one now this one is off the charts strange and also a very closeup
encounter I mean the ETS walked right up to the witness in this case and I call
this one ETS offer cake Yes you heard me
there are a number of cases where ETS will offer people food of various kinds
and this is a case like that that I haven't heard before and it's a really
remarkable and again professionally researched case occurred in December 3rd
1979 in vast Sweden and this is a single witness case
but certainly it's a compelling testimony and there's details to it I
think that match so many other accounts and the emotional re action from the
witness is clearly sincere her family absolutely endorsed her testimony and as
you'll see I think it's an amazing case this very interesting case has a single
Witness by the name of Lillian Carlson who you can see here and it was around 1
a.m. on again December 3rd 1979 and lilianne was walking near her
home at she lives at let's see if I can get this right longev gten 43 in vasic
Sweden and she was just planning to walk around this large natural Park area
where an artificial Hill had been built for skiing you can see it here it's a green grassy area with no trees or
bushes she was just walking along with her hands in her pocket kind of staring at the ground in front of her she had
really just started her walk when she suddenly stopped and became Frozen in her tracks because right in front of her
she saw a craft now it wasn't touching the ground but almost floating about 3
feet above it she had a very strong feeling that she was being watched although she couldn't see any humanoids
at this point but moments later two humanoids came around from behind the
craft and they were about 5T tall or so 5' n very thin she says they were
totally and seemed to Glow with light and she could kind of hear them
talking she didn't understand but she had the feeling that they were talking about her and discussing her which made
her feel kind of funny uh she says all seemed crazy to her now she they were
probably talking telepathically she's not entirely sure but she thought she
heard them say that she was not ready ready for perhaps breeding
anyway as Lillian says I couldn't hear it but in a strange way I sensed that
they were discussing my person I felt ridiculous in their presence but suddenly Heard a Voice besi beside me
saying I shouldn't be afraid now these two beings approached
right up to her she realized they didn't walk they were floating a few feet above the ground one of them held out its hand
and there was something in its hand that looked to lilianne kind of like a piece of chocolate cake she felt like it was
offering her this cake or whatever it was she didn't take it they held a
device or something seemed to run it around her body she was unable to move
her hands or arms she was totally paralyzed she heard these two beings
talking to each other for a few more moments but they then they turned around headed back towards the craft they
disappeared around behind it in the same manner they had come out lilan then
noticed that this craft was emitting a faint trail of smoke from underneath it
and without warning the craft disappeared she has no idea how she did not see it move away in terms of you
know it flying upwards but the moment it was gone her paralysis disappeared the
encounter lasted she estimates about 5 minutes and she was beside herself she
ran home as fast as she could she admits that she was completely hysterical
crying she was so upset that she even considered committing herself to the local hospital for psychiatric
treatment however turns out her brother knew a UFO researcher by the name of Tor
Wickland so he knew about UFOs and encouraged his sister lilianne to
contact Torah Wickland which she did and this investigator went with her back to
the site the next day uh they didn't find any real evidence of this craft but to this day
Lilian is convinced that she saw a landed UFO and its crew yes the
Witnesses in this case quite young ETS do seem to show a lot of interest in
young people but yeah very closeup encounter can only imagine what it must
have been like to see this landed craft and have these ET float right up to you man oh man that
would be an experience for sure now moving on to the next case this
one is a fascinating and really little known case uh this one I call Three
Little floating aliens there's multiple Witnesses in this case it's quite a
remarkable series of events that occurred on January 12 19
1983 in Pine Township Indiana the witnesses insisted upon
anonymity they didn't even want their exact location to be known the primary
witness is a quite respected professional so that I think was one of
the reasons he insisted upon anonymity but as you will see this is an
amazing and complicated encounter with what appear to be extraterrestrial
humanoids this very interesting casee was investigated by the center for UFO
studies researcher Richard A abuse and was actually published in
their journal the international UFO reporter it's an amazing multiple witness case involving a 45-year-old Man
by the name of Ed Egan and his two sons John aged 15 and Donald 10 though this
is apparently pseudonyms because the witnesses do not want to be identified
and it was round dusk on January 12 1983 Ed had just returned home from work
John and David had come home from school and looking outside Ed was puzzled by
the sight of an L or kind of t-shaped object lit up like a neon sign about 300
ft away from his house and he's looking at this and seconds later his
10-year-old son Donald shouts out something is moving out there at the
same moment their three dogs started barking excitedly so they were all looking
outside at this strange glowing object and Donald said look there's a little
person holding it so Ed and John ran outside Don didn't have his shoes on so
he quickly got his shoes on and followed both his father and older
brother now Ed and John approached this glowing object and this little man
walking right up to this fence where the being stood and once Ed got within about
50 ft of this little being he was shocked to see that this being was actually floating about 2 or three feet
off the ground and it was Tiny he estimates it was about 3T tall with a
large round bald head large eyes very small facial features now at this time
it did have its back turned to him uh Ed did have the feeling it was looking for
something he saw that it was wearing a light gray outfit that looked like a wet
suit with a dark gray belt that had circles or circular objects on it the
glowing L-shaped object it was holding was pretty big about 6 feet high 5 in in
diameter and had fuzzy glowing edges so Ed says funny thing I wasn't
afraid now at this point the younger 10-year-old Don ran outside he was about
20t from the house when he saw get this a second identical being peering over
the fence he called out to his father pointed out the second being which his
father also saw so don walked right up to the second being and said that its eyes were quote bigger than a person's
eyes like a frog has big old eyes he said its nose was quote little but caved
in and flat so Donald says as he walked up to
ite the thing gave me a real weird stare usually when you see something like that
you want to turn and go the other way but my feet just kept going that way now
this second being was also hovering about 2 to 3 feet above the ground now Ed began to approach this
second being so both he and son Donald were approaching it from opposite sides
and as it approached it turned and faced him and this is when he got a really good look at what these beings looked
like and not only that what they were wearing you noticed this jumpsuit had no
zippers no buttons seams snaps of any kind and he walked right up to this
little thing about 12T away he was also impressed by the being's large head and
huge fish-like eyes which he said were quote twice the size of human eyes and
resembling a carps he saw eyelashes actually and said that occasionally the eyes would blink
he did not see any ears and he said the nose was just quote two slits or
indentations so he calmed down his two sons saying they won't hurt us boys
don't be scared but then he turned to this second being who was now looking
straight at him and said we won't hurt you we won't hurt you this being did not
communicate in any way however at this point the older brother John did become
frightened and ran back into the house at that same moment the first being that
was holding this l or t-shaped object began to float fairly quickly in a
straight line towards the West Ed seeing this ran after it maintaining a steady
distance of about 50 or 60 ft between him and this being and as this first
being started floating away the second being also started floating in a straight line that appeared to intercept
the destination of the first being and it was at this moment a third being
appeared right near the small junk pile in their front yard and it was also
floating and according to Ed began to move quote very fast and much faster
than the other two and was again heading towards the other beings all three beings quickly converged with each other
at the same time in fact the third had moved so fast that they only saw it as
sort of a blurry streak as it joined its companions now to the amazement of
Donald and Ed all three beings began to Glow brightly and shoot upwards at a 45°
angle actually clearing the highest trees at the far edge of their property
where the forest began this L-shaped object seemed to straighten out into a
long cylinder and in a matter of seconds all three beings were gone now they did decide to report this
only on the condition of absolute anonymity but they felt it was important to report it and also they really wanted
to know if anyone else had reported any kinds of experiences like theirs this was all new to them now here's another
really interesting thing Ed noticed a peculiar after effect after this
encounter he didn't sleep that well but he says he felt like he needed much less
sleep than before and also said that his job performance improved and everything
became quote much better and things come easier I feel more authoritative and
sure of myself about life I'm not in a hurry anymore less stress
about everything so this really changed his whole outlook on life I found that
case so interesting and poignant I mean one of the kids running away in
fear the father and the son coming at either side towards the ET who's looking
back and forth at them and the fact that they approached within feet of this
little floating ET and not your a gray a little more human looking again it shows
how much variation there is in these humanoid accounts it's interesting the
way they took off just flying up into the air there's a lot to learn from this
case the weird alien instrument that they were holding on to to me the most
fascinating takeaway was the fact that the primary witness experienced a really
interesting reaction where he says he felt more confident and it made his whole outlook on life
improve so that is super interesting to me all right now we move to another case
this is a really interesting case again involving multiple Witnesses I call this
one the glowing giant this occurred on March 6th 1983
this is in France in a very small town called p
and there is mostly one primary witness though as we'll see there was actually
quite a few witnesses to at least parts of this encounter and what she saw is
really strange this next case is quite brief but certainly interesting the main
witness is a 26-year-old woman married with two kids by the name of Madame
vinberg and her mother Madame buong uh they lived together in a small
subdivision of homes on the outskirts of the small town of had and it was around 11:00 p.m. on
March 6 1983 everyone in the house was shocked when the entire interior of the house
became suddenly illuminated by a strange bright light and at the same time there
was a sharp noise coming from outside and looking outside they saw craft of
some kind that they initially thought might be a helicopter but the noise was quote different and a quickly moved away
so they didn't think too much of it and went to bed now the witness had gotten into the
habit of leaving the light on in her children's bedroom because they slept up
in the upstairs attic and it was around 2 or 3 A.M that she woke up to turn off
this light now this room does have a sort of sideways facing Skylight which
looks down on the yard and looking through this Skylight you can see here
she noticed a growing illumination coming from outside but when it's first thought that
someone was out there using a flashlight and looking for something it was a very dark night all the street lights were
off so were all the lights on all the other houses but as the witness watched
this strange glow became brighter she could now see it was round light and she wondered if perhaps maybe one of the
street lights had been turned on but this light started moving and in fact
she watched it move around a group of shrubs stop next to a tall Bush and she
was so shocked at what she saw at this point that she actually physically rubbed her eyes to see if she was
dreaming but of course she wasn't she found herself staring at a very tall
humanoid figure dressed in a silver gray one piece jumpsuit she said he was normally
proportioned arms and legs looked normal but the head was very large and looked
like a luminous Globe resting on the figure's shoulders she couldn't see any
face nor did he have any apparent neck and was walking very slowly directly
towards their house and she could see now as this figure got close that it was
at least 7 or 8 ft tall huge it had a stocky body was very muscular she was
absolutely amazed at what she was seeing watched it for about 2 minutes and she
says it was the light from its head or helmet that actually allowed her to see the color of its
jumpsuit now at the same time she was hearing this weird high-pitched sound
coming from behind the house opposite of theirs so at this point she knew
something very odd was happening she panicked she scooped up her two children ran into her parents' bedroom she
refused to come out and just waited there until morning she did not wake up her
parents but it was some time later realizing that she had seen something
really unusual that should be reported she did contact researchers an investigation
followed uh the investigators examined the area which showed no physical
evidence no evidence of any strange visitors there but but the investigators
did speculate about one thing they wondered if the fact that the witness's house was the only one in the
neighborhood with a light on that this might have attracted the humanoid towards the residents so there you go
another amazing case a 9- foot tall humanoid wearing a silver jumpsuit this
certainly does not sound like a normal person the fact that the whole family saw the interior of their house light up
heard this strange noise immediately prior to this encounter I think it's a
genuine case uh pretty brief yes but absolutely
unusual perhaps not as unusual though as this next case which I call the
shrugging gray lots of accounts of gray ETS this case is a really amazing one
because this encounter occurred over a period of hours all night pretty much it
involved three young Witnesses each of who corroborate each other's Story the
behavior of the ET is so unusual in this case there appears to be a strong possibility of missing time though this
was never really confirmed but this case took place on July 21st
1991 in an undisclosed location in Central Missouri the show me state so
this case was also professionally researched by experienced investigators
and I think you'll find it quite interesting this last and final case is so interesting and really quite poignant
I think the Witnesses in this case are three girls Tina age 12 Melissa age 11
and Aubrey age 10 these are pseudonyms but as investigators Dwayne and Susan
Bedell say all three girls are considered reliable Witnesses they have
no history of fabrication any convinced considerable consternation and fright
concerning their encounter all three girls are bright articulate and above
average immaturity for their age so they are all best friends their encounter
began quite late around 2 a.m. on July 21st 1991 again in Central Missouri we
don't know the exact location the girls had just finished watching TV all the
adults in the house were asleep so they decided to go out into the backyard to jump on their
trampoline and they had just started playing Melissa and Aubrey the younger
ones were jumping on the trampoline while Tina again age 12 watched and this
is when all three of them noticed a white oval-shaped object Dart from the side of the house and descend towards
the ground at the corner of the backyard but they weren't really paying much attention to it they kind of
assumed it was just a car headlight but a few minutes later they heard weird strange rustling noises and
at the same time the next door neighbor's dog started barking Tina the
oldest stopped watching Melissa and Aubrey jumping on the trampoline and looked to the corner of the yard and was
absolutely shocked to see a strange humanoid standing in front of the tree about 30 ft away she described it as
small white very skinny with a bald egg-shaped head kind of a ridge on top
large dark eyes and long skinny fingers she did notice something very strange
the abdominal area of the figure looked almost translucent she felt like she could see the tree behind it through its
body this left her speechless and frightened cuz she could hardly believe what she was seeing this point she's the
only one who sees this but then Melissa asked what Tina was looking at and Tina
pointed to this figure Melissa turned just in time to see this little gray ET
start to move slowly towards the girls and it Advanced about 20 ft away pushing
aside a long a low hanging branch which was M later measured to be about 53 in
from the ground and it was weird cuz as it moved closer it seemed to hunch its
shoulders up in a sort of slow shrugging motion and it also opened its mouth WID
still advancing Melissa had the impression it was sort of tiptoeing towards them she described it really the
same way as Tina did but added that it had a very protruding forehead and the back of its head stuck way out she also
noticed a weird sort of dent in its head she said it had almost no noise
whatsoever so needless to say this frightened both Tina and Melissa Tina
turned and ran followed instantly by Melissa who actually leapt off the trampoline and followed Tina they both
abandoned poor uh young Aubrey behind Aubrey had not seen the alien yet so she
called out to her friends and they quickly shouted out behind you come on
SO Aubrey curious of course turned around to see what her friends were running from and was shocked to see this
gray ET which was now standing right next to the trampoline with its
shoulders still hunched in this weird shrugging pot last year and its mouth wide open I can only imagine how Aubrey
felt to see this being so close but she leapt off the trampoline ran nearly
falling down into the house which was about 20 ft away so once inside the
girls closed and locked the door they looked at the clock and were shocked to see that it was now 300
a.m. and that one hour had elapsed since they went outside which they felt couldn't have been more than 10 minutes
so there's a possibility of missing time here but they ran and woke up one of the
adults in the house one of the girls cousins who was somewhat young but definitely an adult told him that they
had just seen a ghost he didn't believe them and went right back to bed now the
girls did want to wake up their parents but it was already so late that they just decided to retreat to the den none
of them wanted to go to sleep as they were still pretty frightened they thought the encounter was over but it
wasn't they turned on the TV and started to watch it when they heard Melissa's cat
meowing strangely and scratching at the door outside the last thing the girls wanted
to do was open the door but hearing this cat they finally did weirdly in contrary
to its normal behavior the cat ran away it didn't go inside but after some
coaxing they encouraged the cat to come inside they continued watching the TV when suddenly it began to malfunction
the screen grew glowing blank and showing only white static this is when
movement at the Den window caught their eye all three girls looked and were shocked to see the alien looking at them
through the window the gray first looked at Aubrey turned its head jerkily and
looked at Melissa turned its head again and looked at Tina all three girls noticed this weird strange jerking
motion which they said was not at all like a normal person later investigators
decided that this little gray had to be standing on a hail bale of hay that was right below the
window now the girls fled in a group to the basement after several minutes they
climbed back upstairs went into the den to see if the gray was still there and it was still looking through the window
they fled back to the basement and they ended up doing this several times and the gray was there each time the girls
were unsure how many trips they made made but it was several they said
finally thankfully morning arrived a girl the girls told their experience to
Melissa's parents whose home it was Melissa's parents went straight to the den and said that there was nothing
there they did notice that the TV was off which the girls denied having shut it off so that was strange so after
going over this with investigators they did wonder about the missing time aspect
since the girls in insisted they were out there for no more than 5 or 10 minutes when they saw the
ZT another weird detail was that Tina said she recalled doing something when
they saw this entity the second time looking through the window but she couldn't remember what it was she says I
forgot what we did after correlating the girl's descriptions the height of the entity
was estimated at about 4 and 1/2 ft the investigators do believe that they're
very well could be more to this encounter but as far as I know hypnosis was never Pur sued I do wonder if the
Witnesses in this case experienced more than just a sighting of a humanoid given
that this gray hung out their window pretty much all night I can only imagine
but yeah there's some confusion about time here the TV apparently turning off
by itself when no one remembers doing this some memory of problems associated with the whole sighting but can you imag
imagine seeing this gray looking in your window fleeing to the basement and then going up and checking on it several
times and it's still in the window looking at you wow
amazing it's truly astonishing to me how many cases there are like these it's not
just these 10 I've been doing these episodes for a pretty long time now case
after case after case so I think it's long past the time or any type of denial
ridicule disbelief or skepticism you can say that these are
just stories but the truth is there is evidence as we've seen in this case
there's phys these cases I should say there's physiological evidence there's animal reactions there's electromagnetic
effects there's Landing traces there's all kinds of evidence so saying there's
no evidence is simply not true and when you have multiple witnesses to a single
incident report reporting these things that adds another level of credibility and when you have people all over the
world many who have never even thought about UFOs before or telling very
similar details that adds another level of credibility I said it before but it
Bears repeating the re only reason people are still skeptical on this subject is because we are all victims of
the government cover up the worldwide government cover up on this subject again it's very well funded very well
orchestrated a lot of money spent a lot of time spent and that's one of the
reasons I really do this research because so many people are having these experiences they need to know they're
not alone all Humanity deserves to know the truth that we are being visited by
Apparent extra terrestrials and we can argue all day till the cows come home about who they
are and where they come from but the fact is it's real and that alone I think
is the most important fact people need to
understand all right that's it for now I want to thank you once again for
watching I truly appreciate it guys it's because of you I do this so thank you
thank you thank you and until next time keep asking those hard questions keep
searching for the truth it's out there and most important keep having fun
that's why we're here I will talk to you let next week bye for now
