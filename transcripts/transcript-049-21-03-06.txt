Mar 6, 2021
Grays are the most commonly reported type of extraterrestrial. Many of the cases are strikingly similar, however, they also have significant differences. Some are scary and traumatic, while others seem benevolent. This video presents four firsthand cases of different people who have encounters gray aliens.

--Connie, a housewife from Arleta, California sees a gray outside her window, staring at her newborn son.
--Kim, a retired Army vet from Bourbonnais, Illinois, wakes up to see three grays surrounding his bed, telling him to get up and go with them.
--Natalie, a graphic artist from Norway is accosted by three grays in her bedroom, who start to perform an operation on her back.
--Harry, an auto mechanic from Vandalia, Ohio is driving with his wife when they come upon a UFO and two gray aliens hovering above the road.

Four cases involving gray aliens, each with profound similarities and differences. Who are these grays visiting our planet? Why are they here? These four cases provide a little glimpse into the gray agenda and answer some of the questions we have surrounding these mysterious visitors.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in 
the paranormal today's episode is called four encounters with gray aliens grays are by far the 
most commonly reported type of extraterrestrial many of the cases have striking similarities 
however they also have very significant differences each person is of course 
unique and reacts uniquely to their experience but because grays are so common I think it's important 
we learn all we can about them and that's why I wanted to do this video which portrays four 
different people's encounters with grey aliens each of these cases I think illustrate the various 
uh commonalities and variations between gray type encounters first case i'd like to talk 
about I call the alien outside the window connie lopez's encounter in 1969 connie lopez was living 
with her husband in arlita california a small suburb outside of los angeles 
she had three children she had a four-year-old girl a two-year-old girl and had just given birth 
to her son he was two weeks old and a newborn and they decided that they were going to set his crib 
up in the master bedroom in the corner where they could keep a close eye on him so that's what they 
did they set up his crib next to a large picture window hung a little mobile above the crib and 
kept a close eye on him and he was about two weeks old when a very unnerving incident happened 
connie woke up in the middle of the night to hear a strange sound it was like fingers rubbing against glass making a squeaky sound and she looked around and noticed the source of the noise 
and got the most profound shock in her life a grey alien was standing outside the windy window 
looking at her son and it was trying to open the window by rubbing its fingers against the glass 
she had no idea what gray aliens were she had never heard of them or seen anything like this 
all she knew was that this was a humanoid figure and it was not human she described it as being 
about six feet tall it had a large head dark wrap around eyes she didn't notice any real 
nose or mouth couldn't see any ears she couldn't tell if it was wearing anything or 
she could she could see that it was tall and slender and had long thin arms and 
what she noticed most was its hands it had very long fingers and on its fingers were these weird 
suction cup like protrusions very much she said like an octopus has on its tentacles 
that's what it reminded her of these suction cups were lined along the insides of its fingers 
and it was doing its best to use these suction cup like things to try and open this window 
what's very interesting is that this window doesn't open it's fixed 
to the wall apparently this gray e.t wasn't smart enough to figure this out hard to say 
but as soon as connie realized that this was not human and it was trying to get her baby she became 
very frightened it was looking down at her baby didn't even see her or pay any attention to her 
was just looking at her child and then looking up the mobile and connie sat up in bed and 
went to jump up and scoop up her child at which point she found herself 
slammed back into the bed by a strange force as she says there was something keeping me down from 
getting up I remember the pressure I was trying to hold on to the mattress and force myself up 
it wouldn't let me come up I couldn't even call my husband I couldn't yell I couldn't do anything 
i was numb paralyzed I just couldn't move I could feel I was crying because I could feel the tears 
coming out of my eyes I remember all I kept thinking is oh my god he wants to take my baby
the strange gray figure walked back and forth a few times did its best to try and 
open this window that could not be opened and after a few minutes finally just walked off 
connie instantly leaped out of bed and screamed scooped up her son her husband jumped out of bed 
and asked her what was wrong and connie explained what had happened that some strange being 
was outside the window and was wanted to kidnap their baby she felt it was after their baby and uh 
he said well I think you probably just had a dream and she said no it was not a dream it was too real
he did his best to comfort her but it was obvious that he was skeptical in the morning connie was 
still upset she told her husband she's taking the children and the baby and she's going to go stay at her grandmother's or her mother's house for a few days and that's what she did 
for the next three days she stayed away from the house completely and finally came back but told her husband that she wanted to get some guard dogs and uh he 
agreed and they bought two guard dogs but even that wasn't enough connie was still 
traumatized by this encounter and she told her husband that she wanted to move 
and by now he knew the cause of her anxiety and being the loving husband he was he agreed 
and they sold their house and moved they moved to another house in the same neighborhood but connie was no longer comfortable in that house she said she just did not feel safe so this 
case is a good example of how traumatizing a ufo encounter can be interestingly it was connie's one 
and only encounter she's never seen a ufo she'd never had an encounter before or since neither 
has anyone in her family including her son who was the target apparently of this gray alien 
so she didn't even know what to make of it for years it wasn't until years later that she started 
seeing this stuff in the media that she began to wonder and what actually really convinced her was 
i she and I worked in the same office and she walked into my office one day 
and saw a figurine a little figuring a statue of a gray alien she pointed at it and screamed and 
asked me what is that i'm like connie that's a gray alien what do you think it is and that's 
how I learned about her encounter so yeah I think these gray alien encounters are not only the most 
common they're fairly common in general I think they're a lot more common than people realize 
and that many many people are having this type of experience second encounter i'd like to talk about I call marked by the grays kim kamman's encounter 
in 1994 kim cammon was 39 years old he had recently retired from the army he worked as 
a aircraft mechanic for special forces but had retired and was living with his wife 
in his home in bourbon a illinois when he had an incredible encounter with gray extraterrestrials 
he was lying in his bed when he heard a voice wake him up it said get up and come with us 
kevin woke up and saw a gray e.t standing next to his bed it repeated itself get up and come with us 
we're not going to hurt you just relax it's okay and kevin was surprised to find himself stand up 
and obey this gray and at that point he saw that there were actually three of them 
two by the foot of the bed and they began to march him out into his living room as he says 
i was in somewhat of a shock kind of amazed or odd all I know is I got up and walked out I really 
wasn't scared I don't know how to describe it it wasn't like I had control of myself 
they said come with us and I did it wasn't like I really had much of a choice 
he describes them as being about three foot tall large bald heads dark wrap around eyes 
no really visible nose or mouth didn't see any ears or any jumpsuit he recognized them instantly as grey aliens because he had seen them before on tv several 
times but still he was surprised by how alien how non-human they actually looked 
so he walks out in the living room and got another real shock the back wall of his living room had disappeared it was completely gone 
invisible or was like a hole in his house this is certainly something i've heard in many other cases 
as one woman described to me it was like the walls opened like level or blinds so 
this is what kim was describing and these three greys let him out into his backyard 
you could feel the wet grass on his bare feet and looking up he was amazed to see a huge metallic 
gray silver flying saucer he said it had beautiful colored lights blinking around the perimeter 
red blue green and yellow they were very vivid and it kind of just entranced and hypnotized him 
the greys walked him over till until he was under this craft which was just a few hundred feet up 
there was a very large bright in the center bottom of the craft and suddenly it sent out 
a bright beam of light which struck kim and next thing kim knows he's inside 
a small room apparently inside this thing laying out on a table as kim says and quoting it was a 
circular round room all I can remember is being on this steel or concrete like slab like an autopsy 
table i've never been into an autopsy room but it kind of looked like that it was a plain room 
uh he didn't see any of the grays at this point all he could really see was the ceiling above him 
and he was shocked and a little bit scared to see a weird instrument open out from the ceiling and 
come telescoping down towards him this is when he felt his first real fear as kim says was kind of 
like a power tool type of deal stretching down from the ceiling I don't remember any of the 
beings being there they probably were I was just focused on this thing coming down from the ceiling
and uh yeah at this point he started to feel a little fear and he passed out or they knocked 
him unconscious he's not sure uh next thing he knows he's back in his bed he instantly grabs his 
arm for some reason he's not sure why until he sees that there's a strange triangular mark on 
his left forearm on the inside of his left forearm about three inches down from the elbow it was 
very apparent it was a perfect triangle perfect equilateral triangle about a quarter inch on each 
side it was bright red and indented in into his skin though it wasn't painful it wasn't inflamed 
it was very obvious and it wasn't there before he's certainly positive about that 
so he instantly called up his wife who was working the night shift at the local hospital 
and told her what happened and she was shocked and told him she'd be home in a few hours he ended 
up calling her more than once while waiting for her to come home she finally comes home 
and comforted him as best as she could he was pretty traumatized by the whole thing had had no 
experience with ufos or extraterrestrials prior to this he did have one sighting but it was off 
in the distance with a large group of people and he didn't feel any real special connection to it 
however after this experience he did recall that his brother his fraternal twin brother also 
claimed to have had an encounter not with graves but with a praying mantis type of extraterrestrial 
so perhaps there's a connection there he wondered I think he's probably right 
i think this probably explains why he was contacted perhaps the ets were interested 
in his genetics him being a twin I say this because there does seem to be a high incidence 
of twins with among the contactee population this could be a coincidence i'm just speculating here 
but whatever the reason kim was left with the very obvious mark on his arm and that's another strange 
aspect which I do see somewhat frequently among these types of encounters people are left with 
some sort of mark on their arm and a triangle is certainly uh common among these types of marks
so kim was pretty uh upset by the encounter he didn't feel it was particularly scary but 
it just really uh surprised him and he thought it might be a good idea for him 
to go visit a psychiatrist and talk about it so that's what he did he called up the local 
va hospital and decided to make an appointment with psychiatrists which he did 
and the psychiatrist told him that it was he listened to the story and said well I 
don't think it's psychosomatic there's very obviously this mark on your arm and you can look at it one of two ways you can either deny this happened and let it bother you 
or you can just accept it and move on with your life it was kind of an interesting reaction 
because the doctor didn't seem surprised or skeptical of kim's story so it's an interesting uh
i think uh element to this case certainly and the fact that kim was in special forces is also 
an interesting uh detail and makes me wonder if perhaps that had something to do with him 
being contacted although he was retired it's hard to say at any rate this did have a very profound 
effect on kim he became very interested in ufos following this and often watched ufo programs on 
tv and one day he got what he believes is corroboration of his encounter 
and another abductee was talking about what he had experienced and said that following his encounter 
he was left with a triangular mark on his arm and they showed this mark on the television screen 
as kim says and i'm quoting they showed the triangle I thought I was going to crap in my 
pants at that moment it was like ice went down my back looking at that I was like oh my god and my wife just looked at me and said hey that's the same mark you have on your arm 
isn't it yup it was the same mark that I had on my arm I always thought there were extraterrestrials 
out there but when it happened to me I am convinced I am very solidly convinced of it now 
so although kim's encounter was somewhat frightening he does not believe that these 
greys are evil and he doesn't feel like his experience was uh bad he feels it was actually 
benevolent as he says it was a little scary but I wouldn't call it an unpleasant experience 
if I had to go through it again I probably would because they didn't hurt me I don't know what they did if they put an implant in me or not I can't say I wasn't forced into doing anything 
no anal probes but I know they put a mark on my arm and it was a pretty good sized mark
so I told that case in my book on board ufo encounters and uh it's very similar to other 
cases but again also has some interesting and unique elements third case i'd like to talk about 
i call healed by grace natalie's encounter in 2017 I was contacted by natalie that's a pseudonym she 
did not want her real name used natalie lives in norway where she used to be a graphic artist 
but today works in human rights and social activism this sort of thing and back in 1991 
she worked as a graphics artist and had suffered a severe injury to her neck and back 
i was causing her all kinds of problems and she wasn't sure what she was going to do about it and that's when she had this very interesting encounter with three gray extraterrestrials 
and i'll just let natalie describe what happened to her in her own words and she says I woke up 
one night with a terrible pain in my back and I realized that I couldn't move I discovered my bed 
was surrounded by little grays one was taller and was doing some surgery on my back they flipped me 
on my back like I was a rag doll I was terrified they didn't say anything the non-communication 
scared me and they left through the wall outside there was a bluish light and then I could move 
again and I went straight to the window everything looked different even in nature it was like 
looking into another dimension then suddenly the light was gone and everything was normal
natalie was stunned and she stumbled back to bed and sat down and that's 
when she realized something incredible she no longer felt any pain in her back 
as she says the amazing part was that my back pain from my injury was gone and never came back 
whatever this was it has healed me and made my life a lot easier I became a lot more interested 
in ufos and ets or interdimensional beings I also became a vegetarian and animal rights activist and 
more politically active in human rights issues environmental protection and peace activism
i find this very interesting because this is a pattern i've noticed with other cases people who are being contacted or in particular healed are often people who 
are doing good work for humanity in some capacity whether it's a teacher a doctor 
a police officer or a social worker this sort of thing and that's certainly true in natalie's case 
also interesting is that natalie has no prior history of ufo encounters like connie 
and like kim she was never visited as a child by gray et's uh yeah not usually people who have an 
encounter with grey aliens they will describe childhood encounters but uh this did not happen to natalie kim or connie so I find that kind of interesting I told natalie's story in my book 
the healing power of ufos and it's one of more than 300 cases of people who have been healed by 
ets which is why I think this is definitely one of their agendas and this case illustrates that and 
by the way while natalie uh never had any other visitations by grace she did have a couple of 
distant sightings and she did have one interesting experience while she was driving late at night 
as she says she was driving in a rural area when she heard a calm female voice say very clearly 
elk could be here and i'll just let natalie describe what happened next in her own words 
as she says instinctively I pulled the brakes and stopped the car as soon as I could out of nowhere 
an elk came across the road and literally jumped over the hood of my tiny daihatsu car I got mud 
from the elk's hooves on my front window so whatever the voice came from it saved my life
so again we have another encounter with gray et's 
but as you can see each case has strong similarities and significant differences 
and the fourth and final encounter i'd like to talk about I call making friends with et's 
harry williams encounter in 1995 harry williams worked as a car mechanic 
he lived in a town with his wife and his parents the town was vandalia ohio a small town and 
one evening he was driving home with his wife when they saw something strange ahead of them 
hovering over the road it was just about 20 feet up hovering right above the road off to the side a little bit and it was a perfectly round spherical shaped craft and as they approached it 
it became immediately apparent that this was a ufo because there was a large picture window 
and through this huge round window in front he could see two gray extraterrestrials 
i'll just let harry describe what he saw in his own words as harry says you could see the whole 
spacecraft you could see that opening right there it was like plastic and you could see the both of 
them sitting there there were two of them one of them was sitting on each side and one had his hand 
on the controls in the middle I suppose that's what they operated the spaceship with I don't know 
they had their hands there I could see their arms and their little hands that's how close I was you could see the controls it was like a tea control 
harry turned to his wife and said look honey there's aliens in it there they are look 
his wife took one look at this thing and screamed and looked away and started begging harry 
to drive off harry however was very intrigued and slowed the car down to a near stop and as 
he came right alongside this thing just stared right back at these gray et's who were looking 
directly at him as harry says they didn't say a word what was so fascinating were these black eyes 
big black eyes and a big gray head it just fascinated me because it looked like they could 
look right through your living soul and yet it was a calm type thing they didn't make any action or 
movement with their arms or anything they had those big black eyes and they had a little nose 
with two little holes in it hardly any nose at all and then they had the lower part of their mouth 
that's how close I was all I could see was just their heads and arms they were gray I could not 
see anything on their bodies I couldn't see any clothes at all just gray figures 
they were looking right at me I could feel like they were almost looking right through 
me it was kind of scary and I thought well i'm just going to keep on looking at them 
and harry would have kept on looking at them had his wife not gone into complete hysterics and just 
begging and screaming for him to race away and finally he relented and drove off to his surprise 
the object followed them and he sped up the car and this object sped up and actually followed 
them all the way home more than a mile and he screeched into the driveway his wife immediately 
fled into the house but harry called out his parents and other family members who saw this 
object which had now risen several hundred feet up so that you couldn't see the grays or the window 
itself but you could definitely see this strange glowing object and he's like look it's a ufo 
and everyone seemed impressed it was clearly unexplained but as they all walked the subject darted upwards and they went back inside and everyone just kind of forgot 
about the entire incident and it was never really discussed after that for a long time 
it was this encounter that really woke harry up to the fact that he was having contact 
because after it happened he remembered many other things in his life that were very strange 
this particular encounter really changed his life as he says it's just something that i'll always remember for the rest of my life I mean it seemed like they were so smart you can just tell 
they almost looked through your living soul thinking you're an ignorant thing or what but yet they still in a way want to talk to you and uh yeah after having this encounter harry 
started to examine some curious incidents that had occurred to him as a child and a young adult 
he remembered at age six being visited by a strange glowing purple entity in his bedroom 
and following that he started to have a real fear of being kidnapped or taken away 
it was so bad he had trouble sleeping at night and could only fall asleep if he hid under his 
bed or underneath piles and piles of blankets or even slept in between the mattresses themselves 
on other occasions he would just leave his bed in his bedroom completely and go and sleep under the stairwell so this really caused him some trauma but he didn't know where it was coming from 
and this lasted to into adulthood uh his strange sleeping habits and this fear of intruders 
and being kidnapped he was never able to really pinpoint where it was coming from though he also 
had uh other strange effects uh he remembered a feeling of being watched 
this was something that was very strong and uh was all through his childhood and into adulthood and continues today this feeling 
of being observed at the time he didn't know where it was coming from or what to make of it 
but it was definitely causing problems for him as a young adult he had other strange experiences 
he was a teenager and he had the rare opportunity of being alone in the house with a couple of older brothers that was not common but on this occasion uh in 1962 
uh while he was a teenager he did have a very unusual encounter on their seven acre 
farm in a rural area he again was alone in the house when a ufo landed in the backyard 
uh in the forest behind their house uh he couldn't see the object itself all he could see was a very 
bright bright white light in the forest but it was two three hundred feet long and extremely bright 
i said whatever it was it must have been the size of an airliner and he was very intrigued 
fascinated and decided he was going to go hike out there and see what it is and he got close 
to it and that's when he started to feel a strange fear and it wasn't he felt coming from him he felt 
like it was coming from the object almost as if it was being exerted upon him because as he would 
take steps closer and closer this fear mounted and became so intense that it actually paralyzed him 
and left him so weak that he was unable to make any further steps forward and he turned around 
and stepped back and the fear left and if he when he tried to go back to it again the fear returned 
so he feels like it was some strange effect that they were exerting on him at any rate he had 
going back into his house and watching from the window this object stayed for over an hour and 
finally it just blinked out so that was a strange incident another strange thing he does remember is 
a couple of episodes of missing time I could just never figure out where the time was going suddenly 
it would be uh early in the evening and next thing he knew it would be late so that was weird and 
that continued throughout his uh young adulthood and into adulthood but sort of tapered off at 
some point and then in 1985 he has this really really profound encounter and following this 
he not only realized he was in contact with ufos but they began to appear regularly 
often they would appear when he went outside to work or when he came out of his 
place of employment they would appear again and on each occasion they would follow him to or from 
his home this happened many many times dozens of times over the next 20 years these objects would 
just appear and follow him in his car as he says I get ready to go to work and here these craft would 
be following me they would be following me to work and following me home some of them were real close 
so close and I got so scared of course I had to keep an eye on the road they never hurt me 
they just followed me and certainly in the morning they'd be waiting here i'd get outside and get 
ready to go in my car and go on the highway and I could see them on the left-hand side and when 
i went ahead and started driving down the highway the lights just kept following me down the highway 
at first harry was a little bit unnerved by being stalked by a ufo but after dozens of 
experiences like this he not only became used to it he kind of looked forward to it in a weird way 
as he says it's weird in a way I looked forward to it in a way they're like buddies like here we are 
i don't know if the ufos seem to like me or they follow me around I have no idea what's going on 
but yeah this happened over and over again and sometimes they get close often it was off up in 
the distance sometimes he could step out into his backyard and he could see these star-like 
objects way up there and it was pretty apparent to him that they weren't stars because they were unusually bright and they would send down little spikes or beams of light little rays of light 
he was absolutely convinced that they were kind of keeping an eye on him so now he knows who's 
watching him and on a few occasions they did come very close in 2001 he stepped out into 
his backyard one evening and sure enough there was one of these weird objects way up there 
he called his wife out to tell her to come outside and look she refused she reminded him she doesn't 
like to talk about ufos and at that moment one of these objects just dropped down out of the sky 
and hovered right above his house as harry says and i'm quoting I was just playing around then 
there it was I said here it comes I about died I couldn't believe it this ufo was on top of me 
and I mean in about two to three seconds it just came right down out of the sky and it was right 
on top of my house it was bright like a big dish that was upside down a bright light type of thing
harry stared for just a few seconds at which point this object darted straight upwards and 
resumed its star-like appearance he called out to his wife to come and look but she 
gently reminded him that she does not like to talk about ufos
so this was the sort of thing that would periodically happen to him he had another very close encounter in 2005 when he was driving home one evening and this object 
followed him and this time it came very very close to his car so close that it scared him badly 
and he quickly parked his car and got into the house he was alone and he turned off 
all the lights and looked outside the window and this object had actually landed next to his house on the street in an intersection right next to his house he said it was very very bright 
and quite large it had to be he's estimating about 150 feet wide I couldn't really see any detail 
just a very bright bright light but it covered the entire spans of the intersection the entire span 
of the intersection and uh he was just too terrified to go outside as he says 
that was about the scariest yet it was neat then following me home like here it is I really see 
them but when it kept following and following it wasn't neat anymore it wasn't funny anymore 
i was in a complete panic just completely scared to death my hands were shaking my skin was sweaty 
this object actually stayed parked there for he estimates uh over an hour maybe two hours 
he was too scared to investigate he would just peek out the window every now and then and after an hour or two he peeked out and it was gone he was sure he was about to be 
abducted but it just didn't happen or at least he doesn't remember it happening 
so despite his strong fear reaction to some of these cases he still still feels like these guys 
are friendly he feels like they're benevolent and he calls them his friends his buddies 
he also feels that they have contributed to something very interesting in him physiologically 
although he's quite elderly he enjoys outstanding good health he went to the 
doctor and the doctor was shocked to see how healthy he was that told him his heart was like a teenager in his lungs he's been he was just in fantastic good health and this is something 
harry attributes to his relationship with these gray ets as he says I think maybe since i've had 
contact with these ufo people they gave me more strength or I have more vitality 
i don't know whether that has anything to do with that I was thinking something happened maybe they gave me something in my veins that caused me to be so healthy I find this interesting 
because certainly there are many other cases like this many other people have told me the same thing 
that they've enjoyed outstanding good health and uh even into quite old age 
and that's certainly true in harry's case another interesting detail about harry's case is that he 
reports a series of visions and precognitive dreams about natural disasters hurricanes 
tornadoes floods he's pretty much convinced at some point the state of florida 
half of it will be under water he does predict that there will be widespread natural disasters 
across uh our planet and this is something we that certainly turns up in other cases when 
anyone gets a message from the ufo people uh that's often what it is so again I think 
this speaks towards the gray's agenda and uh their obvious concern for our planet I told harry's case 
in my book inside ufos along along with connie's case and uh yeah I think these cases show how 
amazingly similar encounters with grays can be and yet how different and unique they can also 
be I think they have important things to say about these gray type ets that are visiting our planet 
for example I think connie's encounter reveals the et's interest in reproduction i've got i've talked 
to many women who've had encounters when they were eight nine months pregnant usually or had just had 
their baby so that's something I see quite often and that's certainly true in connie's case and 
with kim kammen's encounter I find his interesting because he is a fraternal twin and there is a 
high incidence of twins within the experiencer community and i'm wondering if that is a factor 
i also find it interesting they had he received that strange triangular mark on his arm which again is something i've certainly heard from other witnesses 
natalie's encounter also is interesting because like connie and kim she had no prior encounters 
uh and I don't know why that would be when generally that's the rule people who have 
an encounter with gray type ets usually do have encounters in their childhood but that's just not true for the first three cases in this particular presentation
so that's interesting and another interesting thing is that natalie was healed again that's 
something that turns up in a number of cases and the fact that she's a human rights 
activist and working for peace and animal rights and environment is again something 
i see quite often in among contactees so that may be significant 
and uh moving on to harry's encounter I think harry's encounter is interesting because it shows 
how people can have a lifelong relationship with grays that's usually what happens and shows how 
it can be very scary and yet people can also feel like they have a benevolent relationship with et's 
harry did ask his parents if they had encounters and at first they denied it but on her deathbed harry's mom revealed that she too had an experience where she had 
was in her car driving and had been paced by a ufo for several miles so that again that's a pattern
