UFO Encounters can be very weird, but some are incredibly odd. Some contain extremely high levels of strangeness with unique or rarely seen features. These are the kinds of cases that provide important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. This video presents ten exceptionally odd cases, reaching back to the 1930s up to the present day. They come from all over the world. And they provide undeniable evidence for the reality of the extraterrestrial visitations.

SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH. In 1933, a young man was driving late at night near Cherryville, PA and saw a strange purple light out in a field. Approaching, he was amazed to come upon some type of weird craft. And the door was open. Peering inside, he saw bizarre, unrecognizable equipment. He had never heard of UFOs, and it wasn’t until years later that he realized that the object was probably an alien craft.

KNOCKED OVER BY A UFO. On Oct 21, 1963, the Moreno family of Trancas, Argentina was woken by six glowing discs landed near their home. One was very close to them and when they went to investigate, it exploded with light, knocking them to the ground. For the next 40 minutes, the craft targeted their home with beams of light, raising the temperature inside to over 100 degrees. Afterward, it left evidence behind that amazed everyone.

UFO BENDS CAR HEADLIGHTS. Late at night on Apr 4, 1966, Ron Sullivan drove near Ballarat, Australia and came upon a landed. As he approached, his headlights bent by themselves, veering off the road and onto the object. Ron was barely able to keep his vehicle on the road. The object took off, and so did Ron. Two days later, another man driving by the exact same spot suffered an unexplained fatal accident.

THE UFO AND THE BLOODMOBILE. On the evening of Mar 5, 1967, Beau Shertzer and a nurse were driving a bloodmobile along Route 2 in the Ohio Valley when a UFO appeared and began to pace them. To their shock, the UFO extended to weird arm-like devices as if trying to capture the bloodmobile. Thankfully, oncoming traffic aborted the encounter. Beau was so traumatized, he refused to drive that route ever again.

THE BUBBLE-CAR UFO. One night in Aug 1970, Mr. P was riding his bicycle to his home in Birr, Ireland when he saw a bright star-like object zoom toward him and stop overhead. He could now see that it was a craft with a clear glass-like dome. He could hardly believe what he saw inside: four men and four women in military uniform sitting in two rows of seats.

CAR COOKED BY AN ALIEN. While driving along I-75 near Ashburn, GA, late at night on Oct 19, 1973, Mrs. Robinson’s car inexplicably broke down. Sensing a presence, she looked to her left and saw a short robotic entity staring at her. For the next five minutes it walked around her car, and then disappeared. Afterward, her car engine was so hot, it practically melted.

STUCK TO THE WALL BY A UFO. In 1976, a young man was babysitting his younger brother in their home in Bangor, Ireland. Oddly, the younger brother suddenly went to bed, the house heated up and all traffic noise stopped. Looking outside, the witness saw a glowing craft hover over the road. Without warning, it struck him with a beam of light, lifted him off the floor, threw him against the wall, and held him there. When it left, strange landing traces were found outside.

LEVITATED BY A UFO. On Feb 12, 1979, a man walking along the train tracks in Headingly, England saw a green object pace him. Suddenly, it moved overhead, pulled him up into the air, and carried him several feet forward. Then it set him gently back down and zoomed off. The witness was so shocked, he refused to ever walk that route again.

CONVERSATION WITH A UFO. On Mar 24, 1988, Mr. R was drawn outside by a strange light over his home in Tetbury, England. Suddenly it was right over his head and struck him with a beam of light. To his shock, the UFO spoke to him. Mr. R ended up having a long conversation with the UFO, which warned him that humanity's use of atomic power.

SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN’T EXIST. One night in Feb 2013, two teenagers from Richmond, BC, Canada were taking a walk, when a UFO appeared over their heads. They followed it to a nearby school and were shocked to see a black entity hanging upside from the monkey bars. It was an encounter that would change their lives forever. To learn more about this case (and many others,) check out my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

These ten cases provide a fascinating glimpse into the high strangeness that seems to be a big part of the UFO phenomenon. And although they are all incredibly odd, the fact that there are so many of them, viewed by multiple witnesses and supported by a wide variety of evidence, makes them hard to dismiss, ignore or explain away. UFOs are real! We are being visited by a wide variety of ETs. The truth is coming out!

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and  welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal  
Today's Show is a little bit different I'm going  to feature cases that are very strange and in  
fact the title of this episode is incredibly  odd 10 very strange encounters with UFOs and  
extraterrestrials so that's the theme I'd like to  explore yes the UFO phenomenon is strange it has  
lot of high strangeness we know that but some  cases are really off the charts with this some  
cases have absolutely unique and super bizarre  features to them and that's the cases the kinds  
of cases I'd like to focus on today I have 10  cases coming from all over the world in fact  
from Canada across United States South America  across Europe from Australia as well again this  
shows that this is a global phenomenon these  are cases that start all the way back to the  
1930s up to 2013 so that's a span of more than a  100 years many of these cases do involve multiple  
Witnesses that's always important because it  strengthens The credibility of a case many of  
them do involve some really compelling physical  evidence and again the entire range that we often  
see so we have animal reactions we have some  very unusual electromagnetic disturbances we  
have Landing traces we have certainly medical or  physiological effects some very strange emotional  
or spiritual aspects to some of these cases as  well but again some super unique cases and these  
cases do cover the entire range there's quite a  few actual Landings several involving of course  
humanoids as well and each case I think provides  some really interesting insights particularly  
because they are unique and the first case I'd  like to talk about I call something not of this  
Earth what I like about this case is it's a very  early case from the 1930s the witness had never  
even heard of UFOs it took him years to comprehend  that this was probably in fact an encounter with a  
UFO a landed UFO as it turns out and this case  was investigated by a professional researcher  
so I think you'll find it quite interesting  this case took place in 1933 in Cherryville  
Pennsylvania again it's a very early and very odd  account which comes from researcher George faucet  
who's very well respected in this field the main  witness is a young gentleman he was 18 years old  
and he was driving from Nazareth Pennsylvania to  L heighton Pennsylvania in his 1925 Ford Roadster  
it was a summer morning it was around 2:30 a.m.  and he was at a lonely spot on the road somewhere  
between moristown and Cherryville he says when he  got a flat tire and he began to change his tire  
and this is when something very strange happened  now the witness described what happened in his own  
words in quite some details so I will just quote  him directly as he says I noticed a faint violet  
or purplish light in the field on my right it  was not especially bright but the peculiarity  
of the Hue made me curious I walked 200 ft toward  the light on the grass lay a bell-shaped object  
about 10 ft in diameter and about 6 ft High  light was issuing from a slit on the object  
which proved to be a circular door slightly ajar  on close examination this door was about a foot  
in diameter when I pushed it it swung open it was  constructed somewhat like a bank vault door with  
ceiling steps on its edges and at the opening  there was nobody around so I put my head inside  
but because of the peculiar light apparently  coming from the ceiling I had difficulty seeing  
the chamber was full of tubing and dials with  a kind of console in the center there were no  
perceivable windows the chamber was about 6 ft in  diameter and about 4 ft high and it had a dome I  
could see no beds or seats but I remember the  walls had a stried pattern like that of marble  
since I was able to put my head through the door  directly into the chamber the object apparently  
had no airlock the odor in the chamber was similar  to ammonia and the temperature was quite cold the  
shapes of several small objects in the chamber  had strange curves unlike anything I had ever  
seen before or since I withdrew my head and walked  around the object there were no windows visible on  
the outside either nor could I see any person or  creature the outside surface of the object was  
extremely smooth metallic in texture as I recall  and solid to the touch while inspecting the object  
I neither saw nor heard any living thing in fact  the silence was deadly but it's entirely possible  
I was observed I walked back to the car after  10 minutes of examining the object and went home  
so some very unusual aspects there the witness  didn't see the object arrive nor did he see it  
leave he had no idea what it was and at the time  never considered it might be a UFO or a craft of  
any kind uh certainly not from another world as  the witness says when I had this experience I  
had never heard of a flying saucer and hadn't the  remotest idea what the object was but now looking  
back I am convinced I saw something not of this  Earth and perhaps not even of our planetary system  
so the fact that the witness describes this object  is having very unusual Lighting on the inside this  
is something we do hear from a lot of experiencers  the unusual all-encompassing silence is also quite  
common and he really had no idea how to explain  this and looking back in hindsight he wonders what  
kind of being could have piloted this object as  the door itself was so narrow so he also believes  
that this craft must have had an exotic method  of propulsion beyond the use of propellants he  
wonders if anyone else in the area saw this object  but apparently nobody did because all these years  
later his testimony still stands alone yeah that  comes from researcher George faucet a very well  
respected researcher and a certainly an unusual  case I've only heard of a few that are anywhere  
like this one so it's an important addition I  think to the vast number of cases out there and  
here's another really strange case which I call  knocked over by a UFO this occurred on October  
21st 1963 in tranis Argentina and there's some  very interesting aspects about this case one is  
that it involves a whole family a large family  so it's certainly got multiple Witnesses and  
there are witnesses outside the family who also  saw activity but probably the most interesting  
thing about this case is the large amount of  physical evidence surrounding it pretty much  
across the entire range from animal reactions to  Medical effects to some really compelling Landing  
traces but there's some very unusual and unique  events that occurred during this encounter which  
I think makes it worth being more widely known  certainly did get a lot of attention in the area  
where it occurred and a lot of researchers have  looked at this case it's quite an important case  
I think and also raises the question is could this  have been in military humans us as opposed to ETS  
well we'll just take a look at the case and you  can decide for yourself Argentina has provided  
quite a few encounters um this encounter from  tranis Argentina though is definitely one of the  
biggest in the area this case was investigated by  researcher Oscar gindes and he calls it quote one  
of the most exceptional occurrences in the whole  history of the UFO phenomenon so this began around  
9:30 p.m. again on October 21st 1963 when Senora  Yoli Moreno her sister Yolanda their children and  
parents were in their bedrooms preparing for bed  when the maid Dora interrupted them and told Yoli  
and Yolanda very fearfully that strange lights  were appearing outside by the belgrano Railway  
line which was about 450 ft from their home so  they went outside to take a look and at first  
they didn't see anything but then the lights  reappeared and they could see two very bright  
lights landed on the ground and looking at  them it was clear that these were actually   craft later they would find out that these were  disc-shaped craft but between these two objects  
they could see about 40 figures moving back and  forth through this weird sort of tube of light  
you can see the illustration here of what they  saw and they did notice that there were three  
other objects nearby right alongside this Railway  line and the sisters wondered at this point if  
there had been some sort of train derailment it  was quite cold so they went back inside got some  
warm clothes and went back outside to investigate  and this is when the whole family started to wake  
up and realize something unusual was going on  because their sister Argentina woke up and looked  
outside and screamed because she saw that there  were in fact several strange objects disc-shaped  
and one was very very close to the house and  when she screamed she woke up the rest of the  
people in the house and now the ma Dora and the  two sisters Yoli and Yolanda could see this disc  
which was right next to the house it had six Port  holes around the bottom of it and as they watched  
this object began to rotate and at the same time  it became surrounded by this strange Mist things  
were just beginning cuz suddenly the disc emitted  this powerful flame which violently hurled their  
bodies about 6 feet down to the ground I mean  it threw them to the ground knocked them over  
Dora who was closest and standing in front of the  sisters actually suffered first and second degree  
burns and had to be treated at the hospital Yoli  in Yolanda felt only a blast of heat but they were  
not burned but at this point all the other objects  lit up there were a total of six of them and they  
lit up brightly enough to illuminate the entire  property this first and closest disc rotated so  
fast it became kind of a blur surrounded by an  orange Mist but at the same time it emitted a tube  
of light about 10 ft wide which began to shine  all over the house and the property as though  
conducting some kind of a thorough search and one  point this beam seemed to focus on the tractor  
shed they thought that was UN really unusual and  the next day afterwards they found that the oil  
marks on their tractor were gone as if washed  away now this beam of light was not normal it  
would stretch slowly outward kind of like a feeler  a coherent beam of light clearly not a normal  
beam of light and curious at one point cuz Yolanda  thought you know what is this is this a jet stream  
of some kind she stuck her arm into the beam of  light she felt a powerful sensation of heat and  
this light beam seemed to penetrate right through  her arm so she wasn't even making a shadow this  
of course caused her to become quite FR frightened  and she and the others retreated back to the house  
and this is when you know this UFO and apparently  the others were sending down all kinds of beams of   light to each other and on the house and in fact  the others in the House Began praying as beams  
of light started targeting various portions of  the house sometimes the people themselves at the  
beginning of this incident the temperature in the  house had been about 60° f but now the temperature  
quickly Rose to over 100° was about 104 they think  uh their dogs who were normally very protective  
never barked and seemed almost dazed and the same  was true with the chickens in the hen house now  
the family was checking on everyone they had  some very young children who were sleeping in  
their beds through the whole incident but when  they went to check on them their children were   now sweating so profusely from the heat that their  bed clothes were drenched with per perspiration so  
these beams of light were shining into the house  making it as bright as daylight and it's not clear  
but according to the witnesses descriptions it  seems as though these beams of light themselves  
came right through the walls and all everyone  was running around in the house trying to avoid  
these beams which were occasionally targeting  them specifically and this went on for a long  
time about 40 minutes finally the object did leave  the objects the family went outside to investigate  
and saw that this mist from the object still hung  thickly in the air it had a strong smell of sulfur  
and Below where this object the close one had  hovered they found a circle of ground completely  
covered with these little white spheres I mean  it was piled high 3 feet high with these little  
white spheres they were quite delicate and crumbly  they found others near the railway where the other  
objects had been but these little spheres yeah  were very delicate and crumbled under the least  
pressure they were able to collect some of these  and submit them to an analysis they were analyzed  
by Walter Gonzalo at The Institute of chemical  engineering at the University of tuaman and they  
were showed to be composed of calcium carbonate  and potassium carbonate so certainly unusual  
but not necessarily of extraterrestrial com  composition hard to say because elements are same  
the same all across the universe but there were  other Witnesses because turns out their neighbor  
who lives right near to them as you can see on  the map his name Francisco tropiano didn't see  
anything but as he says I didn't see the objects  but I did observe an orange glow that persisted  
for 30 minutes behind the Medina mountain range  uh and there were other Witnesses in the area now  
Yoli Moreno whose husband was in the Air Force  was contacted by the Argentine Navy and told  
to fill out a questionnaire about the encounter  her what she learned was sent to the Pentagon in  
the United States and reportedly this was one of  the cases that inspired Steven Spielberg's movie  
Close Encounters of the Third Kind I think you'll  agree that's a very compelling case one that does  
deserve to be widely known and it's interesting  that this had such an effect to the point where  
maybe it actually did Inspire Steven Spielberg  with Close Encounters of the Third Kind wasn't  
able to verify that completely but that's what  some people have said about this case so who  
knows either way it's an important case and so is  this next one because this has an element to it  
that I don't know that I've ever heard before uh  there are a lot of cases with very unusual beams  
of light or unusual electromagnetic effects  and this one is as the title of this episode  
says incredibly odd I call this case UFO Benz  car headlights this occurred on April 4 1966  
near Borat Australia and it's created quite a  sensation among UFO researchers also has kind  
of a dark element to it a sort of unfortunate  aftermath which may or may not be related to  
this case but again you can make up your own  mind about it this case is not only incredibly  
odd but as I said it's got a dark tragic side  to it was on the evening of April 4 1966 when  
Ron F Sullivan then a 38-year-old businessman was  driving outside the town of St arode on the denol  
St arod Road near Burks flat this is near balarat  Australia and he saw a glowing light in the field  
alongside the road now he assumed at first this  was a tractor but he's driving along at about  
60 m per hour and as he gets close something very  strange happened this weird light suddenly became  
much more brilliant then to his shock his car  headlights began to Flicker and then the beams  
of light themselves were suddenly pulled at a  diagonal towards the light in the field but at the  
same time they bent back towards the road in other  words instead of going straight they turned right  
towards this object and then left back onto the  road in one continuous beam so with his headlights  
bending off into the field he saw that this light  which he thought was a tractor was actually a  
small 3ft wide white disc hovering right above  the ground and the closer he got to this disc  
the more more his headlights bent towards it and  I'll just quote Ron Sullivan directly as he says  
and I quote everything seemed to be in the form of  light suddenly my headlights pulled hard over to  
the right for some unaccountable reason instead of  lighting the road they lit up the fence as though  
they were being attracted by a magnet I breaked  as hard as I could and glanced over to the right  
in the middle of the paddock was a column of  colored light about 25 ft high and shaped like  
an ice cream cone it would have been about 3 ft  wide at the bottom and 10 ft wide at the top not  
far away I saw a brilliant white disc about 3 ft  in diameter the object was just above the ground  
and from its upper surface it projected a conical  array of shimmering rainbow light extended to a  
height of about 15 ft then suddenly the colored  cone Rose to a height of 20 ft and the disc below  
climbed above it in the next moment the whole  light complex vanished so in another interview  
he said the headlights of my car were suddenly  diverted to the right for no apparent reason  
and had I followed them I would have run off the  straight stretch of road so yeah this road was  
going straight and he very nearly had an accident  he is absolutely certain this disc was not natural  
and that it was intelligently controlled and when  his headlights bent off the road he first thought  
that his car itself had veered off the road  and into the field so he automatically tried  
to correct his steering only to find that he was  now driving off the road to his left so it was  
with great difficulty and quick reflexes that he  managed to stay on the road and avoid an accident  
but it really shook him up he stopped his car and  checked the lights only to find that they were in  
working order whatever had happened to them was  clear that the strange glowing disc was the cause  
but as it was now gone he continued his drive  but he was so upset he didn't sleep at all that  
night and he didn't really talk about it until  he heard that there was 3 Days Later an accident  
in that same area and that's when he reported his  encounter and he called the police about it and he  
thought that would be the end of it but it wasn't  because the police wanted him to go to the scene  
of this accident which occurred 2 days after Ron  sighting on April 6 a 19-year-old Man by the name  
of Gary Taylor collided into a tree and lost his  life it was a fatal car accident and the police  
were very interested in Ron's report because the  location of Gary's fatal accident was precisely  
where Ron had nearly had an accident himself  when his headlights were Bent by the UFO so he  
went to the location where the police questioned  him and they found a strange hole in the ground  
3 ft across 5 in deep deep exactly where Ron had  seen this hovering disc there was sandy soil there  
and it looked like it had been neatly scooped  out there were no other tracks or marks found  
in this area now when Gary Taylor had his fatal  accident there was another vehicle driving about  
a half mile behind him and they watched Gary's  car swerve off the road for no apparent reason  
that they could see now of course the specul  a is that the same thing that happened to Ron  
Sullivan happened to Gary Taylor except that Gary  T Taylor was not able to prevent an accident hard  
to say for sure there because there's no direct  evidence connecting these two incidents except  
for the fact that they occurred in exactly the  same spot and that Ron himself came very close to  
having an accident but it's certainly interesting  that this object bent uh Ron's headlights because  
students of Albert Einstein know that powerful  gravitational fields do actually bend light they  
first noticed this when the light from Stars  near our sun were actually being bent so could  
it be that this object exerted a magnetic field  strong enough to actually bend light that's the  
speculation coming from a number of researchers  another interesting aspect about this case is 2  
days after Ron Sullivan's sighting and actually  the same day as Gary had his accident April 6  
Australia would have its most famous and widely  viewed Encounters of all times which was of course  
the westall high school UFO landing in Melbourne  Australia which was witnessed by 200 300 students  
and teachers so that is a weird correlation there  the fact that that case does have Landing traces I  
think really strengthens The credibility hard to  say for sure whether the accident that followed  
that case is directly related to it or not it sure  looks like it given that it occurred in the very  
same location I don't know but what an unusual  and tragic case and here's another case which is  
just beyond bizarre I don't know that I've heard  of this one before so when I ran across it I was  
like Wow people should know about this I call this  one the UFO and the blood mobile now there are a  
lot of cases where UFOs are attracted to certain  locations or areas or activities we know this  
that there are UFO attract trors such as mines  or graveyards or installations and there are a  
lot of cases where UFOs seem to be attracted to  Vehicles particularly Vehicles carrying unusual  
cargo and I think that may be what happened in  this case which took place on March 5 1967 in  
the Ohio Valley in Ohio so here we go it's quite  a case this case case from researcher John Keel  
has got to be one of the weirdest on records  there were two witnesses an anonymous nurse  
and 21-year-old medical worker Bo Scherzer again  it was the night of March 5 1967 and the two of  
them had worked all day collecting blood donations  from people in the area and were driving in their  
blood mobile along Route 2 this runs parallel to  the Ohio River in the Ohio Valley and they were  
on their way back to Huntington Virginia it's not  known precisely where this encounter occurred but  
according to the witnesses it was a deserted part  of the road with very little traffic and this is  
when they both saw a flash of light in the woods  over a small hill this was at night seconds later  
a large white glow appeared appeared Rose slowly  into the air and then flew straight for their  
vehicle clearly targeting their vehicle and the  nurse cried out my God what is it and Bo replied  
I'm not going to stick around to find out and  he pressed his foot down on the accelerator in  
an attempt to outrun the UFO however this object  was determined to Pace this vehicle swooped right  
down over the blood mobile and began to Pace it  and Bo who was driving rolled down his window and  
looked up at it and he was shocked and horrified  to see some kind of weird extension being lowered  
from this glowing craft which was really only  a few feet above the blood mobile very low and  
the nurse looked out the window on her side and  she saw another arm or extension coming from The  
Craft reaching down on her side and she yelled out  it's trying to get us so it looked to both of them  
like this UFO was trying to grab the blood mobile  with sort of pincher like devices Bo continued  
driving as fast as he could but no surprise the  object easily kept pace with their vehicle this  
went on for only a few moments when suddenly they  saw headlights from other cars approaching in the  
opposite direction and this apparently aborted the  encounter because as these other cars came near  
the object retracted the two armlink devices and  darted off at high speed but by this point the two  
witnesses were near hysteria they rushed directly  to the police and reported what happened this case  
did receive only minor press attention but did  catch the attention of John Keel through a a mere  
coincidence really because following the encounter  Bo did not want to talk about it he refused to  
give in any interviews at all and as John Keel  says the case was told to me by the school teacher  
father of the witness and he told me the story  in front of his class I have no reason to doubt  
the story but I must explain that I've never  been able to get the young man on the phone I  
gather that he was pretty badly taken up by the  incident which is hardly surprising I found Bo's  
father in Point Pleasant he was convinced his son  was telling the truth and says that he now refuses  
to drive along that Highway even in daylight well  I certainly don't blame him for that and this was  
an area where there was a lot of activity and of  course John ke wrote The Very well-known book The  
Moth Man prophecies about the activity that was  going on in that area around that time I wish we  
had more information on that case John Keel did  his best to interview the witness directly but  
he didn't want to talk about it which I can  understand the nurse involved in this case   has never been located unfortunately the main  witness has passed away so that case is pretty  
much going to stay where it's at for now at least  but certainly in unusual case that deserves to be  
well known and here's another case which I call  the bubble car UFO I wanted to include this case  
because it's a very unusual description of a UFO  craft seen very close up by a really good witness  
and was investigated by professional researchers  experienced researchers so there's some reasons  
to believe that this is a highly credible case but  it's so unusual and the figures inside this craft  
once you hear their description definitely it's  the kind of case that makes you go hm and I wanted  
to include it because I wonder about this case  could this be our own craft reverse engineered  
and piloted by humans or are these ETS again you  can make up your own mind this one occurred on  
August 1970 in in beer Ireland this very unusual  case involves an anonymous gentleman known only as  
Mr P he's a farmer and former qualified mechanic  and he contacted UFO researchers an Griffin and  
Pat Delaney to share his very unusual UFO sighting  which took place in Burr this is in county offi in  
Ireland and he was bicycling home around 7 or  8:00 p.m. got about halfway home when he saw a  
bright star-like object low in the sky and moving  fast and when he realized it was coming closer and  
actually slowing down he got off his bike and  stood watching the object and after about a a  
minute of observation he started to feel some  fear and he says he actually became paralyzed  
with fear thinking that this object was coming  for him and it got closer and closer to him and  
finally it just stopped and hovered and he was  able to clearly see its shape and what was inside  
of it he says this looked like quote a bubble car  and you can see the illustration here the center  
and bottom part was brown and beneath it was a  green light which started revolving clockwise  
but only when this object was stationary in the  sky he said it was totally silent and the top  
section was perfectly clear transparent like a  glasslike dome a bubble and he said it was close  
enough that he was able to clearly see inside  and what he saw absolutely astonished him the  
interior was very simple was composed only of a  central Corridor very narrow and on either side  
were four armchair style seats there were four  men on the right side and four women on the left  
side all of them see SE facing each other and  they were all human looking all in their early  
20s he estimates they all wore what looked to him  like military uniforms he says the men were clean  
shaven with tidy haircuts they wore green gray  army coats it looked like and the woman he says  
wore a military style coat and skirts and they  had very neat straight shoulder length hair says  
it looked to him like they were all specifically  chosen for this Mission now being a mechanic he  
was especially interested in this craft itself did  it have instrumentation and control panels and no  
he couldn't see anything like that no controls  no panels no antennas nothing to explain how  
this object was able to move the way it did and  after just a few moments of watching this craft  
it began to take off and as it did the green  light beneath It sped it up its rotation and  
then it turned from green to Orange and this  object suddenly shot straight up at super high  
speed and at this point something very interesting  happened Mr P instead of feeling intense fear felt  
this strong wave of disappointment sweep over him  he realized he was hoping that the occupants would  
try to make contact with him or actually take him  and it was a feeling he said that persisted for  
over a week so was this ours were these normal  people in there were these ETS the witness  
obviously can't say all he knows is that it was  a very odd sighting so that's a pretty brief case  
it is a simple sighting though the witness did  see humanoids I found it interesting that his  
emotional reaction went from Fear to wanting to  go with them to being completely disappointed  
that the encounter didn't go further than it did  so that is a very interesting aspect to that case  
as well and here's another case which is just off  the charts odd I call this one car cooked by an  
alien there are a lot of cases of people who are  driving along highways and encounter a UFO or an  
ET there's no actual UFO in this case just an ET  but some really unusual electromagnetic effects  
on this witness's car this case took place on  October 19 1973 in the middle of a massive wave  
of humanoids across the United States and the  world this one took place outside of Ashburn  
Georgia and is a really interesting case which  although does involve a single witness in terms  
of what happened to her there are apparently  corroborating Witnesses who also saw unusual  
activity it was late at night as Mrs Robinson  that's the all we know about the witness we do  
not know her first name she was driving Southbound  on I75 uh just near Ashburn Georgia when suddenly  
and without warning mult multiple systems on her  car failed including the engine itself her brakes  
her power steering all of it she did managed to  pull onto the shoulder and was trying to figure  
out what was wrong when she became overcome by a  quote strange feeling and looking very slowly over  
to her left outside the driver's side window she  was shocked and frightened to see a small humanoid  
standing next to to the car now she described this  as being a quote 4ft tall metal man who appeared  
to be wearing a metallic peer-like outfit capped  with a bubble or dome made of the same material  
there were two openings for eyes the slits were  rectangular if the window was down I could have  
touched it so it was right standing next to her  car can only imagine how frightening that must  
have been been but she said this figure seemed  almost robotic in its movements very Strang  
looking because from the elbow down the arms she  said were very narrow and wrinkled and reminded  
her of a chicken's legs and for the next five or  six minutes and that's a long time this creature  
this figure walked around Miss Robinson's car  and as she says the creature disappeared after  
walking from the right side of the car to the  front and then around to the back now she never  
saw any UFO she say she didn't hear any weird  noises smell any odors of any kind she was very  
reluctant to get out she was quite frightened but  she looked in the rear view mirror and didn't see  
the creature now her engine still wasn't working  and realizing that something was very wrong and  
fearing it might blow up she actually got out of  the car she looked carefully around there was no  
sign of the creature she walked to the front  of her car raised the hood hoping to attract   the attention of another motorist but as she did  so thick smoke came pouring out of the engine now  
unfortunately for her she had to wait for nearly  an hour and a half before a Georgia State Trooper  
showed up and called for a wrecker to tow the car  the car was towed to a mechanic who said that the  
hood of the car was so hot that it was nearly at  The Melting stage and as Miss Robinson says it  
was so hot and the metal So Soft that it looked  like you could poke your thumb through it but  
the paint was not affected so the engine in fact  was so hot that the mechanic said he had to wait  
another hour and a half before he was able to even  touch the engine so that's in total 3 hours after  
this encounter with this strange robotic humanoid  and it seemed absolutely a unique encounter but  
the Georgia state trooper actually told Mrs  Robinson that there had been quote several  
other reports like hers from motorists that day I  do wish we had more information on that case it's  
so unusual to I mean what happened to that lady's  car who who knows but a very unusual case in terms  
of the electromagnetic effects on the witness's  vehicle but also the description of the ET as well  
I wonder if perhaps she had missing time I don't  know she never saw a UFO it's a really bizarre  
case and here's another one that's just so weird  I call this one stuck to the wall by a UFO and I  
don't know that I've ever heard anything quite  like this that's why I wanted to include this  
account in this collection because it's got some  really unusual effects I suspect this is more than  
just a sighting but you can make up your own mind  about it this one took place in the fall of 1976  
in Banger Ireland UFOs can produce many strange  effects but this one is truly bizarre this comes  
from researcher Jenny randles and it involves an  anonymous young man who was employed as a civil  
servant in Banger Ireland and was babysitting  his younger brother now normally his younger  
brother is very rebellious about going to bed but  strangely and perhaps significantly on this night  
he went to bed on his own apparently that almost  never happens so that was strange but things were  
about to get much stranger for no reason that  the witness could determine the temperature in  
the house became stiflingly hot even though  the heater wasn't on the witness went to the  
bathroom and the high strangeness escalated cuz  he now noticed that the street sounds outside  
the house which were very loud normally cuz this  was a busy street but were now totally silent so  
wondering what was going on he opened the blinds  to the bathroom window and was amazed to see see  
a large white oval light hovering directly above  the road and as he stared at it trying to find  
an explanation for what it might be it suddenly  started to grow in size so perhaps it was growing  
in size or coming near to him either way without  warning a beam of brilliant white light as the  
witness says the purest white light I've ever  seen came out of the UFO and moved very slowly  
towards him and then struck him so again a very  unusual beam of light he said he was blinded by  
its Brilliance and now found himself being thrown  back hard against the wall and stuck to it about  
one foot off the ground just stuck there he says  he remained pasted to the wall utterly paralyzed  
unable to move for at least 10 seconds oh he says  it felt longer than that uh he saw lights flashing  
in front of his eyes during all of this and the  next thing he knew he was sliding to the floor he  
was still partially paralyzed it took him a few  moments to regain his senses and recover but he  
did and looking out the window he now saw this  light climbing into the sky at a 45° angle and  
the next day he went outside and saw a flattened  circular patch of grass exactly where this object  
had hovered outside his window definitely a very  unusual case with a lot of unusual effects with  
the house heating up like it did as we've saw in  the previous case a kid being stuck to the wall by  
this beam of light but there's also Landing traces  the fact that his little brother went to bed by  
himself without any complaint the witness thought  that was unusual which makes me wonder was there  
some influence there going on it's certainly  possible because sometimes people behave in  
ways that surprise them during a UFO encounter so  there's always another case it always surprises me  
when people say ah where's the evidence you know  I'm skeptical because there is a lot of evidence  
and you can dismiss one case or two or 20 or a  100 the fact is there are thousands upon thousands  
upon thousands I mean we're again like I've said  before approaching I think a million documented  
cases and and it's probably a lot more than that  so Skeptics at this point don't really have a leg  
to stand on they're just far too many cases  to ignore and here's another one which I call  
levitated by a UFO and this one is super unusual  and really quite surprising I don't know that I've  
heard anything quite like it this occurred on  February 12 1979 in hingley England I like this  
case cuz all although the witness is anonymous  it was investigated by experienced researchers  
this is another short case but it's so incredibly  odd I had to include it this case comes from very  
experienced researchers Graham and Mark birsa it  was around 6:00 p.m. again on February 12th 1979  
as an anonymous Railway employee had just exited  a train to heading late but he got off and decided  
to walk the one mile alongside the track to his  home now as seen here in figure a he was walking  
by the railroad tracks on his left and noticed a  strange green glow at almost ground level on the  
other side of the two railroad tracks in fact it  was so low it was actually behind some bushes so  
as he's looking at it he first thought it might be  stationary but as he walked he noticed that it was  
actually keeping Pace with him there was snow all  around and it reflected off the snow looking very  
eerie now at this point a train began to approach  on his side so he had to cross the tracks to the  
other side and thus move much closer to this  strange glowing green object and in fact when  
he crossed he was now only a few feet away from  it and as the train went by this strange green  
Mass rose up a few feet and then targeted him  moving directly over his head so close it was  
only a few feet above him and wondering what  it was he tried to reach out to touch it but  
couldn't quite reach it and as seen here in figure  B uh it was several feet wide seemed amorphous and  
then something extremely strange happened this  Railway employee found himself being pulled up  
vertically into the air levitated about 6 or 7 ft  and carried forward along the tracks about 15 ft  
in the direction he had been walking levitated up  into the air and then suddenly set down so he was  
scared confused he gathered himself and finally  looked back at the object and now saw that it's  
it seemed to have grown in size and dimension  and now appeared to be a more solid object sort  
of oval or triangular shaped it had a green glow  coming from behind it a green Mist surrounding  
it it looked solid but he rushed home and for a  long time told nobody the only other effect of  
this encounter was that he decided to never walk  along that track again and who can blame him yeah  
that case is so hurt I can only imagine what it  must be like to be just walking along and then  
suddenly you find yourself floating in the air  I guess the take away from that is if suddenly   you find yourself levitating look up to see if  there is a UFO overhead and I can't blame the  
witness for not wanting to take that pathway ever  again cuz that would be certainly disconcerting  
to say the least now moving along to the next  case which I think of all the cases that I'm  
presenting today this one has to be the oddest  this one is so strange there are a lot of cases  
where people have communicated with ETS face to  face uh have received telepathic messages of all  
kinds this one is weirder than that I call this  one conversation with a UFO and there's a lot  
to like about this case which occurred on March  24 1988 in tetbury England I like it because the  
witness was very skeptical himself didn't want  to report it finally felt compelled to it was  
well researched and the messages he got this long  conversation he had with this UFO Echo a lot of  
other cases but as we shall see it's got some  really unusual elements to it so it has to be  
one of the strangest UFO encounters on record  comes from a 77-year-old man known only as Mr  
R he was afraid to report it at first because as  he later told investigator Kevin Owens it seems  
very unprobable and I was afraid of joining the  ranks of the cranks so he kept quiet for a few  
months but changed his mind and said that his  experience was quote the kind you investigate  
and the investigator himself called it quote quite  extraordinary I agree and I think you will too so  
it was around 10:15 p.m. and Mr R looked out of  his kitchen window of his home located again in  
tedbury England and saw a light about 900 ft  away going across a field and he thought for  
a second that this might be a Shepherd rounding  up sheep which were quite numerous in this area  
but he pretty quickly discarded that explanation  because this object whatever it was was actually  
floating about 10 ft in the air and seemed to  be crisscrossing this field in a weird scanning  
pattern he says it was football shaped around the  same size quite small and although brilliantly lit  
didn't seem to cast any light to the ground it's  again another thing we see in some of these UFO  
cases very unusual lights so he was puzzled and  curious and he went out into his backyard which  
actually slopes upward and will give him a better  view of the field and this object so he goes out  
there and when he reaches the wall at the edge of  his property and looks into the field this strange  
object is gone or so he thought because suddenly  coming straight from above him he was struck by a  
beam of light from this same object which was now  directly over him so this really shocked him and  
and he instantly cried out out loud what's going  on now he wasn't expecting a reply but he got one  
anyway and he ended up having a very interesting  and quite lengthy conversation cuz it was a few  
seconds later a strange voice replied we are just  observing your world now per the witness Mr R  
this voice sounded out loud tiny and unn natural  almost as though it was coming through earphones  
so it was apparently out loud uh but at this point  this is when the strange conversation began Cuz  
Mr R replied told the UFO he said well you've  come to the wrong part to see anything and the  
UFO replied after a short delay we know where you  are and Mr R said when you say we who do you mean  
aliens or something so again after each question  by Mr R there was a short pause a delay as if  
each response he thought required careful thought  before being issued or perhaps for another reason  
as we shall see from the UFO's next response so  Mr R said when you say we who do you mean aliens  
or something the UFO replied no no alien means  here what you see is a probe similar to how your  
scientists send out to observe other planets Mr  R replied how can you understand me the UFO said  
your voice is recorded on the probe and relayed to  us for a reply Mr R said oh that's clever but I'm  
not sure what's happening why are you observing us  what's the matter the UFO replied you are gaining  
knowledge so fast and getting to the very basis  of the structure of matter and you could cause  
Untold harm if you don't know what you're doing  Mr R replied well I don't know about that I'm not  
a scientific man I suppose it makes some sense  the UFO replied if your species doesn't learn  
some sense we will have to take measures against  you Mr R replied what do you mean are you going to  
exterminate us UFO said no nothing like that we'd  have to take action to reduce your activities Mr  
R replied could you do that the UFO said oh yes  easily it wouldn't take much to upset your order  
of things Mr R replied what would you propose to  do then the UFO said you are very susceptible to  
bacteria and viruses something like that that  would cause disorganization Mr R said you could  
in introduce this into our world the UFO said yes  of course Mr R said how will we know it's you and  
the UFO said you won't know we don't propose to  tell you Mr R said where are you operating from  
where are you UFO said well you're not clever  enough to understand that are you Mr R said  
I quite agree I'm not an astronomer do you come  from far away UFO said well quite a distance Mr  
R said are you in what we call our solar system  and the UFO said we may be Mr R said farther a  
field the UFO replied we may be there's no point  in asking such questions Mr R said what is really  
the problem how come you are allowing it to go  on why not just nip it in the butt the UFO said  
explain what you mean by nip it in the bud Mr  R said alter it before it gets too far Advanced  
and the UFO replied oh yes we could do that so  Mr R was prepared to ask more questions but at  
this point and without warning the glowing craft  disappeared and the conversation ended it really  
left him quite shook up and he wondered at first  if this might have been some secret US aircraft  
from the nearby kemell base Airfield about 7 miles  away but reviewing all the high strangeness of it  
he decided that this was probably an actual  UFO and felt compelled to report it and he  
told investigators that he was able to remember  this conversation in quite some detail because it  
was so unusual I think you'll agree that case is  incredibly odd but certainly worth knowing about  
and once again yeah it's not at all unusual that  people get messages about how we are treating each  
other our ourselves and the planet itself so that  is a common theme and certainly the investigators  
felt this was a legitimate case and now we get  to the last case for this episode this is one I  
personally investigated it is in my book humanoids  in high strangeness so if you want to learn more  
about it you can certainly check that out I call  this one something that shouldn't exist this is  
a direct quote from the witness who saw a very  unusual humanoid it's quite an unusual encounter  
and this one occurred quite recently February 2013  in Richmond this is in British Columbia Canada and  
as we shall see it's a very unusual sequence of  events leading up to an incredible and very close  
encounter with a super strange humanoid it was  a cold night in February 2013 when 21 yearold  
Corey this is a pseudonym and his friend who  I called Devon were hanging out at the Dyke at  
the end of Blundell Road pictured here where they  often went to sit and talk they were having this  
profound conversation about God and the meaning of  life really heavy duty philosophical subjects and  
as Corey says we both wish to see something lo  and behold it appeared suddenly without warning  
an uncanny silence pervaded the environment as  this fiery Orange red yellow object appeared and  
approached them at about Treetop level very low  and it was large according to Corey this object  
appeared to be about 70 ft wide and was no more  than 50 feet overhead he estimates and as Cory  
says in his own words it chose to investigate us  it came so close to me and my friend I wondered if  
it was physically affecting our bodies it filled  the sky directly above us it covered the entire  
25 ft width of the Dyke and stretched beyond that  the color was incredible I have never ever in my  
life seen anything like it up close it looked  like liquid plasma it felt so weird to be near  
it it was so strange it was so surreal and as they  watched this orange red yellow object shrunk down  
to a 6ot wide green and pink sphere surrounded by  Mist it started to move away so both of them took  
off and actually chased this object down Blundell  Road to number one road seen here and watched as  
this object moved and hung directly over the  grower Elementary School and both of them had  
the impression it was watching them and showing  itself to them intentionally they were overcome  
emotionally by all this so they fled back to  Corey's house pretty late at night at this point  
this point Corey heard in his head telepathically  this almost Angelic voice saying be prepared be  
prepared so they were making a lot of noise and  didn't want to wake up the other occupants of the  
house and they went back outside walked out  to the field by the school and saw that this  
craft was now hovering over the water actually saw  the Canadian Coast Guard underneath it and heard  
rounds of ammunition going off it appeared to them  that the Coast Guard was actually shooting at this  
object this absolutely freaked him out they began  screaming at the top of their lungs trying to wake  
up the neighbors though weirdly nobody seemed to  hear them nobody came out but the weirdness just  
escalated they saw several strange orbs of light  rising up from behind this craft nearby they saw  
another large what looked like a triangular  shaped craft hovering pretty low overwhelmed  
they decided it was time to go home and they were  walking by the monkey bars at the field at grow  
grower Elementary School pictured here and these  Monkey Bars were right on their left and this is  
when they saw something they could hardly believe  and I'll just quote Corey directly as he says in  
his own words we saw a being covered entirely in  Black sitting upside down on the monkey bars the  
height was about 4T tall the same as a toddler it  was just a general shape and appearance with what  
appeared to be the outline of a head 1/3 the  height of the body it was completely black the  
size of a toddler with a huge head it was simply  gazing at us so this figure was so close only 4T  
away but its appearance and Its Behavior were  so bizarre was really hard for them to process  
what they were seeing as Cory says again in  his own words it looked like it was bending  
light around it there is a black paint on the  market called vanta black that absorbs about  
98% of light this was absorbing over 100% I  can't explain it it was like it was sucking  
the light into its clothing now at this point the  creature actually reached out and tried to touch  
Corey's hand and that was enough for him and his  friend Devon CU as Corey says we both panicked  
and ran away I was so close to touching something  that shouldn't exist how Wild is that so if this  
affected them both very profoundly and in fact  Cory's friend Devon his mental health began to  
decline rapidly to the point that Corey decided to  break off the friendship and Cory himself said he  
was very profoundly affected he could hardly  stand seeing that color the red orange color  
as would bring him back to the incident and cause  all kinds of emotions and he also started to look  
back on many weird experiences he had as a kid  where he would see weird beings in his bedroom  
often this being would come and stare into to  his face from only inches away and sometimes  
it would take on the appearance of his brother or  one of his parents he say it always came from the  
closet he started having outof body experiences  he would see visions of alien faces weird planets  
weird languages he developed an ability for art  he started getting telepathic messages in fact  
one message told him that he himself was not fully  human so these experiences continued at age 15 he  
once woke up to find himself paralized unable to  move and his room was filled with blue light in  
2012 he saw a close-up craft with his girlfriend  soon to be his wife but it was really his 2013  
experience which changed everything for him cuz  as Corey says since then I have seen many orbs  
shadow figures sometimes and had visitations  and feelings of strange presences in my room  
I think things have been contacting me for years  but I keep being scared I feel like I am being  
watched and observed and they are waiting for the  correct time to interact so he's still searching  
for answers as he says all the things I've seen  and experienced it has truly left me baffled so  
he reached out to me uh in search of answers and  Confirmation consented to an interview was quite  
excited to be interviewed and again his case does  appear in my book humanoids in high strangeness 20  
true encounters and there's quite a bit more to it  than I've presented here so if you're interested  
you can definitely check that out that case like  all cases have volumes to teach us I thought it  
was really interesting how profound the Witnesses  were affected by it and it's always interesting  
to me when Witnesses struggle to find the words  to describe what they've seen um because that to  
to me is adds to the level of credibility because  it's very difficult to describe a UFO ENC Conor  
when you're suddenly confronted with something  that's completely out of your world view it's  
hard to describe and when you are changed that  profoundly uh by your encounter well that is not  
unusual but it certainly speaks to The credibility  of a case and how impactful a UFO encounter can  
be so that's it for today 10 cases all the way  from the 1930s to 2013 a span of more than a 100  
years involving quite a few Witnesses I mean  what's that 20 30 people in just this episode  
alone alone who are reporting unusual activity  so again I'm just going to underline it Skeptics  
really need to start doing their research because  you could dismiss every single one of these cases  
if you want but there's another 10 to replace it  and if you dismiss those there's another 10 so  
it's time that everyone starts taking this subject  more seriously it's clear this is happening uh the  
physical evidence is undenied able you can try to  explain it away but I think it's pretty obvious  
what we're dealing with here are extraterrestrials  perhaps not every single case can be explained in  
that way but I think we have enough cases of  humanoids and craft with Port holes and ETS  
coming out and leaving Footprints and so forth  to say that yes we are not alone there are other  
people out there very much like us and they're  almost always humanoids so that's our episode  
for today I want to thank you once again for  watching it's always appreciated until next time  
keep asking questions keep searching for the truth  and most important of all keep having fun bye for now.
