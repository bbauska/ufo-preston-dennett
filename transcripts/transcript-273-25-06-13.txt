INTERFACING WITH THE GRAYS: THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTACTS OF MATEO TREMBLAY
Jun 13, 2025

Summary:
Jun 13, 2025
The UFO contact story of Mateo Tremblay (pseudonym) is both extensive and unusual. He has had lifelong interactions with a variety of extraterrestrials, including grays, human-looking ETs and at least one reptilian encounter. He has had numerous onboard encounters, two near-death experiences, many face-to-face encounters, direct telepathic communications, and a long list of paranormal experiences. He has interfaced directly with the grays and learned volumes of information about them.

Mateo’s first memory of ET contact began in 1970, when he was only four years old. At the time, he lived with his mother and stepfather in a six-story apartment building in a large city in France. One night, Mateo woke up to find himself somewhere else. He was lying on a comfortable table in a small round room with glowing white, rounded walls. Standing next to him was an 8-foot-tall, hooded figure helped him off the table and said, “It is done now.” Mateo sensed the figure was female and tried to see what she looked like. She said, “You are not allowed to do that.” A male figure stood by, next to a small console. The female led him to the wall and said, “Let me show you your home.” The wall turned transparent, and a huge green planet appeared. Mateo felt an intense longing. The scene moved to a scene of swirling stars, and then the Earth. The lady said, “You must go home now.” Suddenly Mateo woke up in bed. That morning, his concerned mother told Mateo that he was missing from his room in the middle of the night. He told her what happened, and she said to never forget the experience, and never tell anyone.

That same year, Mateo and his family went to the beach. Mateo entered the water and was pulled under the surface. He was missing for 15 minutes before he was found. He was given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and fully recovered. Before long, more strange experiences occurred. While walking to school, he started to experience missing-time episodes. Mateo soon had recall of being taken to a strange round chamber. There were other children and a tall female humanoid who instructed the children on various subjects. Mateo recalled being given an implant in his leg. Mateo had several such encounters. When strange marks appeared on his body, his parents were investigated for child abuse. Thankfully, they were found innocent.

Mateo grew up, got married and started a family. On August 8, 1988 (now living in New Zealand) he was visited by the grays again. Mateo was concerned because now the contact involved not only him, but his family. The marriage didn’t work out, and Mateo moved out and found another place to live. One night in September 1993 (at age 27), a foreboding feeling enveloped him, and he found himself pulled from his home into a transparent spherical craft. Two other men were there and a human-looking pilot. They were shown a massive mother ship. Mateo was then returned. Soon Mateo began seeing UFOs and started to experience incredible telepathic communications from the ETs. He joined a contactee group and began to meditate regularly, which caused an escalation of psychic abilities and communications with the ETs. He had a second near-death experience with a life review.

He then had more onboard experiences where he saw grays, human-looking ETs, other ETs and many other people, some of whom were undergoing strange examinations. His concern turned to anger. He returned and decided to pull back from connecting with the grays. He still had psychic experiences, but his contacts slowed down. Years passed with few experiences, except for one amazing sighting.

But in 2021, Mateo was visited in his bedroom by an apparent reptilian entity. It was a deeply frightening and traumatizing encounter. But it encouraged him to reach out telepathically to the grays. They told him that they had heard his plea to assist with the healing of his cat, who had recently been diagnosed with severe health problems, and had come to do a healing. Mateo was still furious, but thankfully his cat made a near full recovery. Following this, Mateo began to have deeper communications and intense telepathic downloads with the ETs.

Says Mateo: ““I have never claimed to hold the 'truth' and be so presumptuous as to know why the EBEs are interacting with us. In fact, after fifty years I am still unsure and confused to a large degree… Yet I must confront the facts: physical sightings leave no doubts; physical scarring leaves no doubts. The interface and gifts are all but too real to dismiss. Most of all, this profound knowing is more than just a core belief system. A lifetime of studies in metaphysics, physics, psychology, and neurolinguistics have helped tremendously to somewhat put some of the pieces of the puzzle together or glean some types of patterns."

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. I have a very special episode for you today. I'm going to be talking about one man's lifelong
experiences with extraterrestrials. I call this episode interfacing with the
grays, the extraterrestrial contact story of Matteo Trembley. That is a
pseudonym. I interviewed this man extensively. We went over and over his story trying
to get all the details right. He's a very kind and intelligent man, very shy.
He insisted upon absolute anonymity, but really felt it was important to come forward because he knows there's a lot
of people out there who are going through the same things as he is. His story is definitely one of the more
unusual I've heard, one of the more extensive. He's had contact since a very
young age. And not only contact, but being taken on board a craft, having face-to-face encounters with a wide
variety of what appear to be extraterrestrials, grays, insecttoid looking beings,
humanlooking beings, all kinds of experiences, including psychic experiences, and paranormal events. He
does have an idetic photographic memory. So, he recalls his encounters in great
detail and fully consciously. So that alone I think makes his case super
important. And like most contacties, as I said, his experiences began at a very
early age. So that's what I'm going to start with and we'll just move on through his life and explore his amazing
experiences. I did present his experiences in my book, Humanoids and High Stranges. It's quite a long
chapter, so I'm going to summarize it quite a bit here, but I think you'll find it pretty interesting. I'm going to
start with the first encounter. It was 1970 and Matteo was only four years old.
He lived with his mother and stepfather in a sixstory apartment building in a well populated city in France. In the
dark early morning hours one evening, he awoke and realized with a shock that he was no longer in his bedroom. Instead,
he lay on a soft, comfortable table inside a strange looking room. There was a very tall being. He estimates eight or
nine feet tall, dressed in a hooded monk's robe of a strange material. This
being took him by the hand and helped him off this table, which was now lowering itself to the floor. And the
being spoke, saying, "It is finished." Now, this was apparently telepathic.
Though Matteo isn't sure of this, he did sense that this was a female, as she
seemed kind and nurturing, and he was very curious about who she might be. So he tried to peer under her hood, and she
replied firmly, "You are not allowed to do that." The only part of her Matteo
could see was her hands, and he saw that she had only four fingers, which were very long. Another tall robed hooded
figure stood nearby and when Matteo tried to see its face, it said, "You are
not allowed to look at us." This figure was stern, and Matteo sensed he was male. Looking around, Matteo could see
that the room was rounded with milky white glass-like walls. It was well lit
with a pleasant light emanating from no discernable source. Everything in the room seemed to be molded into the craft
itself. no seams. He did see some unusual instrumentation and tools in
front of the male being, but there was no sharp edges anywhere. The male being
then spoke and said, "We are wasting our time. This is not the right specimen.
Something went wrong." Matteo felt no fear, but instead he stared around him
with wonder and curiosity. He tried again to get a glimpse of the being's face, and the male one said again, "You
are not allowed to look at us." He wondered, "Why would their appearance frighten him? Was this why they were so
insistent?" The female spoke to him and said, "You must go back now." And she
led him towards one of the walls. She pointed towards it, and the milky glass turned transparent, and Matteo could now
see outside the craft. And as Matteo says, "What I saw truly amazed me. Being
inside the craft was almost like a normal situation, but what I saw out there took my breath away. I was peering
into space and countless stars." "Let me show you your home," the female said.
"I'll just let Matteo describe what he saw." Says, "Mate, outside, I saw a
multitude of stars, far and deep, and yet so close. Then they started to move
towards the right and downward. Some getting smaller from behind. Some getting bigger from the front. All very
fast. Finally, we slowed down and in front of us, a planet came closer and
closer. It was totally covered in green, hovered with vegetation. We stayed there
hovering a little bit. Then we went back fast into deep space with the stars
going faster and faster again. Then the planet Earth came into view. It came closer and closer and we stayed for a
few minutes watching it slowly revolve. At this point, the female being seemed to appreciate how Mateo had behaved
obediently during this whole encounter. She told him goodbye. Maybe we will see
each other again. Matteo looked over at the other male figure who seemed to shake his head with a negative response.
Matteo looked back outside to see the earth filling his view and the next thing he knew, he was back in bed. How
amazing is that? The ETSs apparently took him to another planet, his home
planet. He felt an intense sense of longing when he saw that green planet.
It wasn't Earth. Super interesting. And he still remembers it to this day. And
this is also interesting. That morning, his mother gave him a bath and asked
him, "Where were you last night? You were not in your bed." That's when Matteo told her the whole story of being
taken on board this craft, physically examined and everything that happened. And she listened very seriously and then
told him two things. One, never forget what happened to you. And two, never
tell anybody. And he obeyed that for most of his life, only recently coming
forward to share his experiences. But that of course was not the only
thing that happened to him. It was just a short time later that he had a really profound experience which would change
the course of his life. And this was a near-death experience. One day in 1970,
Matteo's parents went to visit his aunt and their family to spend a day at the beach. Without warning, Matteo
disappeared. His family could not find him. They scoured the beach, but there
was no sign of four-year-old Matteo. His mother was frantic and ordered Matteo's
father, who couldn't really swim, into the water to search for him. Everyone
joined him, going up to their necks in the water, forming a line and searching for Matteo. But they couldn't find him,
and they started to exit the water. But Matteo's mother shouted out, "You are not coming back without my son." So
Matteo's stepfather returned into the water, frantically searching, nearly drowning himself. And as he walked back
towards the shoreline once again, he spread his arms and felt something. It was Matteo. He had been underwater for
at least 10 minutes, maybe 15. They rushed him to the beach, placed him on
the sand, and immediately gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. And to everyone's tremendous relief, Matteo
coughed up a huge volume of water and began breathing on his own. His eyes fluttered open, and miraculously, he was
fine. He didn't remember a whole lot of this, but he remembered a little bit. As Matteo says, "This is what I remember.
Being inside a fog, peaceful, and a presence saying, "Not to worry. All is
fine." Having spoke with a lot of UFO contactees. Quite a few of them have had
a near-death experience. I guess it's a coincidental thing. I don't know. But there does seem to be a
high incidence of it. And that's certainly true in Matteo's case. This near-death experience really changed his
outlook on life. Gave him a much more spiritual and philosophical outlook, which would serve him well in the many
experiences he would soon have because it wasn't long after that that he began
to have some missing time incidents. But the thing is, he actually recalled what was happening during these missing time
incidents, at least much of what was happening. These would occur when he was walking to school, which was just one
block away. This occurred from around age five to age 8. It happened numerous
times. And it was really interesting because he found he remembered that he was being taken to a place where there
were other children, apparently a tall female extraterrestrial, and all of them
were being taught various things. So, I call this next segment the secret
school. Although he was quite young, Matteo's mother allowed him to walk to school alone. This usually presented no
problem. But on several occasions during this very short walk, Matteo found
himself someplace else. The first time that he can consciously recall, he was
just walking along when suddenly he found himself in a spacious milky white
domed area. There were a half a dozen other children his same age. They were
all sitting down, docsil and quiet at the foot of a large, unusual looking tree filled with leaves. The floor
itself seemed somehow synthetic, and the whole area seemed somewhat familiar to
him, and he wondered if he'd been there before. But most strange was the presence of a tall, slender, humanoid
lady who did not look quite human. She had large, dark, very unusual eyes, long
black hair. She wore a long gown. She radiated authority and wisdom, but she
was also very stern and unemotional and very peaceful, says Matteo. She looked
straight at you and deep. She would then talk to you through the eyes with pictures with some shapes and shades of
feelings. I know it sounds strange, but I guess it could be some sort of telepathy. It was quite hypnotic, and
her leads and commands were undeniable. Her eyes were very wide and large and
intense and very deep, deep dark blue. I guess you could say she was pretty in a
strange way, very unusual. Yet, the whole package was far from being repulsive or threatening. She was
somber, coldish, yet meant no harm. Far from it. All in all, it was fairly
peaceful, but also with a sense of subjugation or close supervision. We
were allowed to move around, but not much. As soon as you strayed off from under the tree, the lady would come up.
So, it was at some point during this encounter that Matteo noticed a scar on his knee that he hadn't seen before, and
he asked the lady about it. She approached him and looked down at his knee and said, "Do not move." Matteo,
now standing, found himself paralyzed. The woman held a small device in her
hand and held it up to his knee. Matteo watched as this scar opened. As he says,
"It was like the whole skin parted from above the very top of the knee and opened up like you would open a book,
but sideways. I saw my kneebone and cartilage and a slice of tissue with
just a little bleeding." She seemed to check something or put something in my knee. She told Matteo at this point, "Be
careful with this." Matteo wasn't sure exactly what she meant. She seemed more
concerned about the thing in his knee than in Matteo's feelings about all this, but at this point, she used the
device to close his wound, very much like a zipper. As Matteo says, she did
that without any words or feeling, silent and precise. The whole incident
of fixing the wound was very fast, 3 to 5 seconds. The next thing Matteo knew, he was back
on the sidewalk heading to school. Upon arrival at the school, the head mistress
complained that Matteo was 3 hours late. And this was not the first time. In
fact, Matteo remembered that he experienced missing time during this age on at least four other separate
occasions. His mom asked him about it and Matteo told her that all he could
remember was walking to school. But sometimes he would find himself somewhere else in this strange room. On
one occasion he remembered finding himself in that same domed location and the same woman lay her hand on his body
where there was a thin incision maybe 6 in in length which he would open and or
close. He never felt any pain, nor did he ever see any furniture or details of
any kind in this strange room. Around age 8, these experiences stopped or he
didn't remember them anymore, but other strange, unexplained things continued to occur. Very, very strange. These
episodes eventually ended, but it certainly wasn't the end of Matteo's experiences. Following these events, he
did notice a few things. He would sometimes wake up with marks or scars, healed up scars on his body. He found a
patch on his head where he was completely bald that hadn't been there before and it remains that way to this
day. In fact, there were enough marks on his body that at one point his parents were brought in for questioning about
child abuse. They denied it. So did Matteo. He says his parents were very
friendly, very kind, very nurturing, and of course his parents were found
innocent, but it was more evidence that something very unusual was happening to
Matteo. He also began to exhibit a wide variety of psychic abilities, often
predicting things that would happen. For example, he had an outof body experience where he saw this car accident very
vividly, 3 days later it happened. Other times he would just shout out advanced
knowledge far beyond his years. This really concerned his mother uh and she
started to forbid him from watching anything to do with science fiction or aliens. So that added a little bit more
stress to Matteo's life. But of course his experiences continued
throughout his teenage years. Not a whole lot happened. He grew up. He did very very well in school. He went to
college and studied numerous disciplines. He got a degree in psychology. He studied a lot of
scientific disciplines. He really wanted to understand what was happening to him.
A very very intelligent man. He met a girl. He got married. He had a child and
things were going great. And that's when his experiences started again beginning with an encounter with the grays. So, I
call this next segment the arrival of the grays. It was August 8, 1988, and
Matteo, now 22 years old and living with his wife in Auckland, New Zealand,
decided to stay up late and watch television. Around 200 a.m., without
warning, the room suddenly filled with a foggy white light, and an eerie silence
settled over the environment. Seconds later, the television filled with static
and Matteo realized that he was totally paralyzed except for his eyes. He sensed
that three figures or beings entered the room and they began to walk down the hallway towards his wife. At this point,
he felt a rush of emotions, awe, confusion, fear. Realizing that these
beings were not coming for him and that they meant no harm, his fear lessened.
But at the same time he felt a powerful urge to protect his family and he tried
vigorously to break free from the paralysis. And this is when he received a telepathic message from the ETSs. They
told him what you feel is not necessarily what you see. What you see
is not necessarily what is perceived. What you perceive is definitely not what
you think this is. So, this strange message caused Matteo's fear to
evaporate. And at that moment, the room filled with a loud noise, quote, like a
freight train. The whole room brightened and dimmed back to normal, and slowly
Matteo found himself able to move again. As he prepared to jump up and check on the others, a voice said, "Do not worry.
All is fine." Now, completely out of character, Matteo obeyed and went straight to bed. The next morning, he
learned that a tornado had struck his neighborhood only a few streets away. It left a swath of destruction about 3
kilometers long, and he wondered, "Was this the strange noise he had heard earlier that night? Had the ETSs come
because of the tornado?" Mateo had no answers. But as he says, "I did not see
this experience as positive. A home invasion and taking control of your movement is not nice." But even more
disturbing to Mattail was that other members of his family were now reporting visitations. It was bad enough that he
had to deal with the fear and uncertainty, the scorn and disbelief, the ridicule and isolation of having
contact, but for it to happen to members of his own family was crossing a line for him. Matteo does not consider
himself as having any artistic ability, but he felt the impulse to grab some Play-Doh, and he sculpted a true-to-life
image of a gray's head. Pleased with its accuracy, he showed it to the others,
all of whom became frightened and demanded that he get rid of it, which he did. This encounter ended up having a
huge impact not only on Matteo, but on his entire family. In fact, it caused
quite a bit of tension between he and his wife and they became separated and
soon after that divorced. This was a very difficult time for Matteo. He
decided that he was going to leave France and move to a remote area of New
Zealand. So, he quit his job, left all his friends, left his whole life behind
and moved to this remote area in New Zealand. And here he met a very
interesting lady who is a contactee and a healer. She had formed a little group
of people who were trying to reach out and contact the grays. This sounded very
interesting to Mattail. He really wanted to understand his experiences. So he joined this little group and he started
having all kinds of very unusual experiences including telepathic
downloads with the grays. So this seemed to be working for him. It involved a lot of meditation and nurturing activities
and this really opened him up and in fact he had this one sort of message
from the grays where they said this is a time of seeding. The result will be long
after you are able to witness. Every step your selected species does has
tremendous importance in seemingly insignificant details for you and for the millions of your kind we interact
with. Ultimately, he decided to leave this group. He felt like it was just not his path. He got
what he could out of it and ended up moving to Auckland. Here, he found a new job, a new place to live. And it was not
long after this that he had another fully conscious onboard UFO encounter
that was truly extraordinary. It was September 1993. Matteo was 27 years old
and one morning he woke up feeling unsettled and anxious and when afternoon
arrived he started to feel a powerful and uncomfortable sensation of electricity around him. He sat down to
steady himself when suddenly he felt himself being pulled upward in a kind of energetic whirlpool and seconds later he
found himself inside what felt to him like a bubble of clear glass. The field
of stars was visible all around him, and he could see the planet Earth far below.
Along with him were two other young men who seemed like friends to him, though he did not recognize them. And a short
distance away in this bubble was a handsome young man standing next to a console of some kind, which was the only
part of the ship or whatever this was that was visible. This man was wearing a
white uniform, and he was not normal. He radiated wisdom. He seemed to be
piloting the craft using psychic ability and was steering the craft closer to Earth. Matteo and the other two men
stared around him in wonder. And always curious, Matteo thought to himself,
"Where does this craft come from?" The man seemed to hear him. He smiled,
pointed in front of them, and said, "There." Matteo looked, and could hardly
believe his eyes. And I'll just let Matteo describe this in his own words. As he says, "The dark space started to
take form, blacker than black at first, but then you could see more clearly. It
was as if the absence of light was revealing a shape against the depth and blackness of the surrounding cosmos.
Perhaps uncloaking itself would describe it. It was as if space was solidifying itself into a structure with just some
perceivable edges. Then you could plainly see the whole of it. It was not
unlike seeing a black jewel, like a polished onyx stone, somewhat glimmering
with its absence of light. And then its structure became more and more dense, as if the sunlight was being less absorbed
by it, and was now to some degree being slightly reflected upon its form. From
afar, it gave a sense of incredible toughness, solid, dense, unbreakable.
Although it seemed to reveal a steellike quality, it was more than that. It looked to be a very smooth texture with
sharp edges, and it was absolutely massive. So, this was a ship of some
kind. Obviously, Matteo and the others were impressed by its massive size. was
more like a small planettoid than a ship, but it had this very unusual, sleek shape. The human-looking pilot
seemed to be subtly amused by the men's awe. He turned to one of the men and offered to let him fly the craft. This
man took the controls and began to maneuver the craft towards the mother ship. Then the man in the white uniform
quickly took control back and said forcefully, "Do not do that. it will
utterly destroy you. And this man demonstrated this fact by moving the
craft slightly closer to this huge mother ship, at which point Matteo and
the others could all feel a powerful energy that seemed almost to threaten to
disintegrate them. And the pilot explained, "Your physical and mental
structure is not compatible with that environment." Matteo and the others felt
a keen sense of disappointment because they all really wanted to go inside that mother ship. But it was not to be, and
the pilot said, "Now our little trip is over." Mateo immediately felt a gut-wrenching, sickening feeling like
being sucked into a downward tornado, and suddenly found himself lying on top of his bed, unable to move. It took
several moments for the paralysis to fade away. Afterwards, he was intensely
thirsty and hungry. And for the next 3 days, he was largely bedridden. As
Matteo says, I was deeply changed. Not positively or negatively. It was just as
simple as having your eyes opened to a different site and nothing would be the same again. This experience again had a
huge impact on his life. He thought back to his time with this contacty healer
group and wondered if it was wise that he had gone there and actually tried to reach out to the grays because it ended
up sort of deepening his levels of contact and he now wondered if this was
a good idea for him because it was quite stressful. This is true I think for a lot of contactes. It's difficult to
integrate these experiences with normal everyday life. A lot of people are
skeptical and don't understand. So, it's somewhat isolating for a contactee to
have these kinds of experiences. And that was certainly true for Matteo. But it wasn't long after this he had a
really remarkable UFO sighting. This occurred one day in November of 1993,
and it was a real close-up sighting of a metallic disc. During the day, Matteo's
new home had a flat metal roof, which was easily accessible, and he often climbed up there to smoke a cigarette or
enjoy the sun and the beautiful scenery. This day was no different. It was mid-afternoon when suddenly he looked up
and saw a quote brightish point of light, and he could see it was moving towards him. In fact, in about 10
seconds, it approached to within 50 m, 150 ft, and revealed itself to be a
round silver disc. A classic flying saucer, not very big, about the size of
a large car. It began an oscillating pendulum-like movement going back and
forth. Matteo was entranced, but after about a half minute, he snapped out of
the trance, ran down to call his roommate so he could also see this object. The two of them rushed outside.
This disc was now closer, only 30 m distant, 100 ft, and stationary in the
sky. And as they watched, it dropped down below eye level and positioned
itself only a few meters above a small Piper Cub aircraft and actually followed
it for 10 seconds. It then zoomed upwards, performed a small turn, and
zoomed away at quote instantaneous speed. And in just a few seconds, it
disappeared into the distance. And that was the end of the sighting. There was a weird aftermath. Two weeks later, this
same Piper Cub airplane collided with a helicopter, killing all people on board
both craft. This amazing sighting really confirmed to Matteo what he already
knew, that UFOs and ETs were a big part of his life. And he really started to
focus a lot more on this. In fact, he thought about it all the time. He really
became consumed with the idea of what was happening to him. He really wanted
to understand it. He was starting to question how much of it was real, how much of it was psychological, what was
actually happening to them him. Was it extraterrestrials? Could it be something else? So he was just filled with
questions and it became a source of anxiety for him and he really really
needed answers and it was about three years later that he had an experience
which answered these questions to some degree and really brought him a measure of comfort. I call this one the orb
experience. It was the middle of the night one evening in 1996 that Matteo
woke up unable to sleep and with a strange feeling. As he says, "I had this
extreme urge to write something down like I was obsessed." So finally he just
gave in, gave up, got out of bed, and grabbed a pen. And to his own surprise,
he automatically wrote down the seemingly random phrase, quote, "As
shiny diamonds, we come down as shiny diamonds to witness." So this shocked
Matteo. He stared at the words, thinking they were nonsensical. When he suddenly heard a very clear, telepathic voice say
in his head, "Come out and witness." This really took him a back. It was quite odd. So he ignored the message and
instead fixed himself a hot cup of coffee, lit a cigarette. Moments later, it happened again. This time it was an
even more clear command, very sharp and insistent, saying, "Come out now and
see." So Matteo had the feeling that whoever had mentally spoken to him was waiting impatiently for him to come
outside. And feeling a little crazy, he just went outside. And as Matteo says, I
noticed a bright star moving slightly. Then it came closer and closer and
bigger until it was about 20 ft above my head, slightly to the right. It stopped
moving, and indeed it was like a big shiny diamond, clear and so bright,
while at the same time having some pearly translucent quality. This object appeared round, less than a meter in
diameter, and it shone gently, appearing almost multifaceted.
He said it seemed to be aware of him, almost alive, and it remained in place for a full minute. Then Matteo heard
that familiar voice in his head again, and it said, "Now you know." The object
then promptly took off horizontally, slowly at first, then arked upwards at high speed and disappeared among the
stars. This sighting and telepathic communication was so intense, so
beautiful that Matteo began to jump for joy. As he says, I just went mental. I
jumped around just like a little kid, laughing with so much joy and appreciation like it was the best
birthday gift. I couldn't help myself but to wave goodbye, frantically laughing, almost to the point of tears,
asking it to come back. It was so beautiful and deeply personal. It was like seeing a long lost and dear friend
again. And I was so grateful to be reunited together. And lo and behold, it
came back. Matteo could hardly believe what happened next. A smaller orb detached itself from the larger one, and
both objects now swooped down to only about 3 m over his head, 10 ft, almost
close enough to touch. Both then took off at great speed. Mattail became
totally overwhelmed with emotion. As he says, a great sense of peace came upon
me. I lay down flat on the ground. Don't ask me why. I think it helped taking it
all in. Suddenly, Matteo opened his eyes to see a police car parked in front of his house. An officer was standing over
him. The officer asked him, "Are you okay?" Matteo quickly jumped to his feet
and said, "Yes, I'm fine." The officer looked at him with concern, but the
officer's partner was waving him back to the police cruiser. So, the officer returned to the vehicle and drove off.
But of all of Matteo's encounters so far, this one really affected him the most. As Matteo says, this was the most
profound, sharp, clear, and meaningful of them all. It has left me deeply impacted in an extremely positive way.
This episode was a turning point, undeniable, and surely a most profound
validation on many different levels. Ho still looks back on that experience with
great satisfaction, great pleasure. It's a real fond memory for him. It helps
settle his anxiety and answer some of the questions that he had about his
contact. He still wondered a lot what was happening to him, why him, who were these guys, what was going on with his
life, what would happen next. Again, these are issues most contacties, I
think, struggle with. Wasn't long after this that he had a really profound outof body experience. And afterwards he sat
in front of his desk and kind of fell into a trance and without willing to
just had this experience involving what we call automatic writing somewhat like
channeling. And he had this message come to him that was truly profound. He takes
no credit for it. It was really an extraordinary experience involving again
automatic writing. So I call this next segment the message. Now Matteo had no
memory of actually writing this message, but it was clearly he who had done it.
Nobody else was there. So he looked down at the paper and read this message in absolute amazement because again it was
incredibly deep and philosophical. And this is what he wrote. Awake little
child. The time has now come to arise to new beginnings. The old ways must fade
to let a new light shine forth like the angels. You truly are and always have
been. Can you now start to remember what it was like to be free of all
limitations when you could spread your wings far within the consciousness of all that is
and always was. You do now know of the divine keys. Trust, faith, and
allowance. These that your mind has locked away within the maze of
subconsciousness, let them again resurface toward the apex
of reality and blossom like a lotus spreading its pedals of wisdom and love
right inside the core of all everlasting beings. How amazing is that? Really
deep, really philosophical, quite beautiful and poignant. Matteo takes no credit for it. He remains open-minded as
to where this message came from his higher self he doesn't know but it
definitely was a comforting message and I think this is something that a lot of
contactees deal with high stranges and psychic events of all kinds and it was
continuing with Matteo this deepened his sense of connection to the ETSs to the
universe itself and it wasn't long after this that he by pure pure synchronicity
became friends with another contactee and this is when he started to experience some other truly amazing
events involving healing and telepathic communication with the grays. So I call
this next one interfacing with the grays. Matteo was delighted to have a
new friend who is also a contactee but she was having some problems. His friend
suffered from lupus and diabetes and one day she dropped a concrete block on her
foot and crushed several of her toes. Matteo wanted to take her to the hospital but she refused. She said no
that the ETS she was in contact with would heal her and she sat down went
into a trance and Matteo couldn't believe his eyes. He watched in amazement as the redness and swelling
went away and her toes began to return to normal. This took about an hour. His
friend explained that she was in touch with Tall Whites who healed her. But still her diabetes and lupus remained
and Matteo feeling his own healing abilities growing decided to attempt a psychic healing on her. And he did this.
To their amazement, her diabetes went into remission and within one month, her
lupus cleared up. She went to the doctor and her doctor was totally amazed. He told her that he only knew of two other
cases in the entire world like hers. But ever since interfacing with the grays in
that healer's contact group, Mattail was feeling a growing connection to the
grays. And in fact, he sometimes felt as though a gray ET was looking through his
own eyes. If he thinks of it, he's able to see its image in his mind. As he
says, it's a gray as we define them, whitish and not that small at all. I do
not understand why people find them ugly or scary. So, while this gray is telepathically connected to him and able
to view through his eyes, the reverse is also true. As Matteo says, some people
might call it telepathy, but I don't like that term. It is way too crude and so unbefitting. It just quote allows me
to look through its eyes as merging, but from its side, mild and soft and in no
way invasive. The overall impression is pay attention to this. Pay attention to
that if you wish to know. It is never judging or condescending, just teaching,
advising, and leading. Merely showing where to look when I get confused with
all that nonsensical UFO stuff out there. So, these experiences brought Matteo a whole new awareness of life,
the universe, and his connection to all of it. It was really amazing how much it
changed his outlook. He also noticed something else. He started to experience a really strong connection to animals,
particularly cats and dogs. They would show up out of nowhere and follow him around asking for food. When he would go
to a friend's house, the pets would always jump up on his lap. This doesn't surprise me. A lot of contacties have a
really strong connection to animals in the environment. A good number of them are really vehement environmentalists,
and that's absolutely true of Matteo. Now, it was just 6 months after all of these experiences that Matteo had
another really powerful experience. He suffered from some pretty bad allergies
and had purchased some prescription anti-allergy medicine and took a big
dose of it and not really thinking about what he was doing, he consumed some alcohol and this brought about a
powerful allergic reaction which actually resulted in a second near-death
experience. So after taking the anti-allergy medicine and then drinking some alcohol, Matteo felt suddenly very
unwell. He laid down in bed and felt himself being ejected from his body and
traveling down a tunnel of light much like people describe in a near-death experience exactly like that. He felt an
incredible sense of peace and found himself in this weird grayish foggy area
surrounded by what he calls a very strong presence. It had a bright light
around the borders. And as Matteo says, it was masculine, all- knowing, and
above archetype being, peaceful yet strong, kind yet decisive, without
judgment, yet with purpose. And it said something like, "Thus we meet at your
forceful requests. Yet, are you sure of the way?" Matteo answered, "Yes." The
being said, "Why are you so sure?" Mateo now felt a movement within him and he
watched as this tunnel appeared which seemed to contain all the events of his entire life. Those he had already
experienced in the past and those he had yet to see in the future. And as Matteo
says, I saw in a flash a timeline, a very very fast replay of past events.
Then it slowed down towards the end and showed the purpose. The masculine voice then told him, "See
and witness the beauty, but you shall not remember now what is to come." And
in gracious awe, Matteo replied, "I understand."
At this point, another tunnel appeared, and Matteo found himself being sucked into this tunnel and down back into his
body. When he woke up, he found himself inside a hospital. and he learned that a
friend had reported him missing and actually called the police who broke down his door and rescued him. He later
spoke with the man who had revived him. And this man said, "I was so happy to
save you, but you looked at me with unforgiving dark eyes and said, "How dare you interrupt?" Now, Matteo had no
memory of saying this. He's not sure if the entire experience was a drug and alcoholinduced hallucination or an
actual near-death experience, but after hearing about other people's NDEs and
seeing all the similarities, he leans towards this explanation. 1998, Matteo
moved to Adelaide, Australia. He had never read about UFOs. He didn't
feel the need. He was already having these experiences. Why did he need to read about them? This is a sort of a
reaction a lot of contacties have. They stay away from this subject. But he
became curious and finally decided to pick up a couple of books on this subject including Timothy Good's book
Above Top Secret and Whitley Strieber's book Communion and a few others. He
devoured these books. He was absolutely amazed at how many of these experiences
were very similar to his own. So this brought him a lot of interest in his own
experiences and he decided to start meditating and not just a little bit he
started meditating daily over a period of three or four months and this brought
a whole new level of contact for him. He started having out-of- body experiences
where he would have ET contact and also what appears to be a fully conscious
onboard experience. So I call this next one on board and astral encounters. It
was during one of his daily meditation sessions when Matteo without any warning
suddenly felt his consciousness being pulled upward in a spiral motion and he found himself walking down a long curved
white corridor. This felt like an out-of- body experience to him. But exploring ahead of him, he saw about a
dozen people of different ages and ancestries. And as Matteo says, what was
weird is that they all seemed in a daysaze, silent and walking in a single
file line, totally emotionless, like sleepwalking, but with their eyes open.
I started to walk towards them when I saw a short gray entity, typical in description of skin tone, large head,
big black eyes, small mouth and nose, etc. He or it seemed busy looking after
the line of people, directing them alongside the corridor, and was looking at a device that resembled what I would
call now a portable tablet computer. At this point, the gray ET noticed Matteo.
He seemed surprised and annoyed to find Matteo there. He pressed a few buttons on his device and then telepathically
spoke to Mateo, saying, "You're not supposed to be here. How did you get here? you must go back now. Immediately,
Matteo found himself being pulled uncomfortably back into his body. And upon opening his eyes, he felt quite
disoriented and out of balance, a feeling which actually persisted for the rest of the day. He wondered if this was
a lucid dream, but definitely leaves open the possibility that this may have been an objectively real experience.
Soon he had another apparent obbe, but this one provided a level of objective
confirmation. During a meditation, Matteo found himself in what he first perceived to be a cave-like environment,
but it had a smooth dome overhead, nearly 50 m in diameter. The floor was
metallic in appearance, and the walls seemed to emit light. And at this point, Matteo realized that this was actually a
craft. He was on board a craft. He saw about two dozen adults, men and women of
varying ancestries. They all stood silently, eyes open but dazed, unmoving,
and a small, tight group. And surrounding them were about a halfozen men with military crew cuts, all of them
wearing long white uniforms. These guys were awake. And while they looked human,
Matteo felt that they were quote just a bit weird somehow. Now after speaking
softly among themselves, one of these men approached Matteo and said, "Let me
show you what happens as you have asked." Now Matteo doesn't remember asking, but at this point he looked to
the far side of this domed room, and saw three to five skinny beings, ETS, with
oversized triangular-shaped craniums facing what looked like a console against one of the walls. Mattel was
told firmly to look away. He felt it was somewhat aggressive, but not nefarious,
but not nice at all. In the center of the room, there were three hospital-type beds. Each was occupied by a person.
Each was being attended to by one of the men in white uniforms. They appeared to be conducting some type of surgical
procedure. And one of these men approached Matteo and said, "Let me show
you how the procedure is done." And as Matteo says, I saw a multicolored thin
metal or glass tube being applied to the lower body of the person lying on the closest bed about 3 to 5 cm above from
the skin upper pelvic area. The man told him, "Now you can do it. You know what
has to be done." So this man began to telepathically instruct Matteo how to
conduct this procedure on one of the patients. But when Mnteo expressed some hesitancy during this procedure, the man
seemed amused and said, "This is not the first time." The man proceeded to
uncover another one of the patients, revealing a woman who Matteo immediately recognized as his flatmate. In fact, she
opened her eyes and seemed to Matteo to be scared. She seemed confused and
upset, and this made Matteo feel uncomfortable, and he said, "This is not right. I don't want to be here anymore.
The man again expressed amusement and told him, "Well, you wanted to be here. You can leave anytime you want. You are
more of an active participant than you realize." This statement really frightened him. He found it quote
profoundly disturbing. And in fact, he wanted no part of any of this and made the decision to leave. His next memory
was leaving the craft, feeling almost like he was quote siphoned down into his
room. That morning, upon awakening, he was shocked to find a large tree trunk
had landed in his backyard. It seemed to have come out of nowhere, was not growing anywhere near his home. He did
learn that there was a tornado reported on the news, but this was nowhere near his home. So, that was weird. But Matteo
was even more amazed when three days later, this same flatmate, who he had
seen lying on one of the tables, said that on the very same night as Matteo's
experience, she woke up in bed to see a small childlike being with white skin,
long white blonde hair, large clear blue eyes, and this figure appeared at the
foot of her bed. Another came into the room and the next thing she knew she
found herself in this weird cavelike environment where she said she actually saw Matteo and other strange people. She
was describing the same details as Matteo's experience. Matteo was understandably shocked because there was
no way she could know these things unless this experience was objectively real. As you can see, this brought
Matteo a whole new level of confirmation that his experiences were absolutely
real. That of course brought a whole new level of stress as well. He decided to
uproot his life. He left everything and moved to England. He quickly landed a
very good job. Wasn't long after this that he had a premonition which actually
saved his life. Contactees have a lot of psychic experiences, but this one for
Matteo was truly powerful. I call this one the premonition. In early December
2004, Matteo was booked at a hotel in Thailand to go on vacation with a
friend. He was really looking forward to it. But then he had an out-of- body experience. And during this out-of- body
experience, he received a stern warning not to go to this hotel. Now, this
really made his friend angry and disappointed, but Matteo cancelled his reservation anyway, and he's glad he did
because it was just a few days later on December 6th, 2004, the very day he would have been at the
hotel that one of the top 10 biggest earthquakes on record struck the Indian
Ocean near Sumatra. It registered 9.1 on the RTER scale and generated a tsunami
that caused massive destruction and cost the lives of over a quarter million
people. The hotel where Matteo would have been staying was completely destroyed. So he believes this
premonition saved his life. But as the years passed, he said he had kind of allowed his ego to take control and he
began to use his gifts for personal gain. And this was when he felt his personal connection to the grays become
weaker and decrease. He stopped seeing orbs. His healing powers and psychic
abilities lessened. He began to feel a lot more fear and experienced negative
feelings about his encounters. He lost that childlike wonder of his experiences. And in fact, his encounters
and weird experiences seemed to come to a complete end. He pushed them away and just tried to live a normal life. Then
years later, in 2012, now back in Europe, Matteo was on his way to work at about 400 a.m. when he saw a quote large
grayish cigar- shaped craft. It was moving slowly across the sky, pretty low
at an altitude of about 200 m, 600 ft. And it was another reminder that as much
as he hated to admit it, UFOs and high strangess were a part of his life. Again, psychic experiences are a normal
part of a contact's life. Matteo's life was so full of strange events. It had become normal for him. But at the same
time, he felt himself torn between wanting to ignore all of this and live a normal life to really diving deeper into
it and trying to figure out what was happening to him. So, there was sort of this pushpull effect that really was
difficult for him and I think for most contacties. Wasn't long after this, he
had a bedroom visitation by an entity that he felt was absolutely negative.
This turned out to be one of the scariest encounters of his life. Although, as it turned out, his fear had
made him misperceive the experience to some extent, and it turned out to have a really happy ending. Nevertheless, it
was an extremely traumatic event. I call this one bedroom visitation by an alien
entity. In September 2021, Matteo's cherished pet cat began to show signs of
serious health problems. He took her to the veterinarian and received a devastating diagnosis. His cat was
suffering from cancer and kidney failure. The vet suggested immediate
surgery. Instead, Matteo decided to first see if he could use his own
healing abilities. And two weeks later, Matteo had what he calls, quote, "the
worst episode to have happened." And I'll just let Matteo describe it. As he says, "I woke up in the middle of the
night and straight away thought that something was wrong. Strange light, unusual night silence. Then this utter
fear came upon me. I have never been that scared my entire life. It was visceral and totally overwhelming.
Something real bad was in the room. And for the first time, I could understand what the term nefarious meant. Although
I never truly believed that evil was a real thing. The whole situation stank of
it. Then realization happened almost instantaneously as I woke up. To make
matters worse, I was totally paralyzed. I wanted to get away, leave the lost
safety of my bed, but I could not. I could only roll my eyes. I could see the
walls and the windows, all too real. I was not dreaming. A tall dark shadow
like cloaked energy was at the foot of my bed, but hard to see. It started to move towards the head of my bed, and I
went wild with nasty fear. Now, at this point, Matteo had the sense that he was prey, helpless, being targeted by a
predatory entity much more powerful than himself. And this being was not small.
Matteo estimates that it was about 7t tall and he got a good look at it. It was thin, insecttoid looking and
appeared to be wearing a monk's robe. And as Matteo says, from the cloaked
dark figure, an arm extended and grabbed my arm. The pain that ensued was very
strange. It felt like it was going through me on an ethereal level, ripping
in a slice. I saw a long skinny arm, dark brown with deep dark greenish
undertones. It had no muscle structure to speak of, more like insecttoid.
The hand was long and slender with a palm very unlike human structure, as if
lacking a muscle tissue with a tough density, but mainly constructed of tendons surrounded by a thick leather
type skin. It terminated with three or four very long and very sharp claw-like
fingers. So at this point, the pain intensified. Anger began to sweep through Matteo, and
using all of his willpower, he managed to lift his head and actually bite this figure's arm. And as he says, it felt
very old and like a very tough leather structure, perhaps with some scales. My
teeth didn't pierce the skin at all, but I still latched on with a mighty bite, as if my life depended on it. When I bit
it above what looked like a wrist somehow, the feel on my teeth was of a tough leather belt. It didn't puncture
it at all, but I did latch on for dear life for about four or five seconds as
it was holding my left arm resting next to my head. This thing, this being
tightened its hold on my arm and I could feel it going through. It was like knives going through the flesh before
you feel the burn of the cut. Somehow this overwhelmed my nervous system. and
I let go of the bite, expecting my own arm to be ripped apart. To my great
surprise, the being withdrew, slowly retreated, and then vanished. Still
scared and confused, I managed to sit up in bed. Now, it was at this point that the weird paralysis mostly dissipated.
Matteo checked on his cat, who strangely didn't wake up, which was very unusual for her. Badly shaken, Matteo remained
awake the rest of the night. The next day, and in fact for several days after that, he slept in another room with the
lights on and the radio playing. That's how bad this scared him. The terror was so pervasive, so allencompassing, he
managed only an hour or two of sleep per night. And two months later, he was still deeply shaken. Matteo felt a wave
of anger sweep over him, and he reached out telepathically to the grays that he had interfaced with years earlier, and
he began to shout and swear, venting his fear and frustration. He let it be known
in no uncertain terms how truly disappointed and angry he was about this visitation. And to his amazement, he
received an immediate answer, a vivid telepathic download. And the answer was
not at all what he expected. The grays told him that the visitation was actually to check on his cat and that
since Matteo was overprotective of his pet, strong measures were taken to ensure that he wouldn't attack them.
Matteo was shocked and he felt another wave of anger sweep through him. He cursed and shouted again, saying that
there was no need to scare him like that, that the being must have been a complete amateur and that they better
not do anything like that again. But still, the answer did ultimately have a positive effect. Matteo's fear began to
go away. His sleeping habits slowly returned to normal. But best of all, his
cat made a near full recovery. Despite the fact that this encounter actually
had a very benevolent outcome, it left Matteo with a real sense of fear. He had
act some actual PTSD from this encounter. It was quite upsetting. It really made him step back and stop
focusing so much on his encounters. But as many contactes will tell you, they
continue to have experiences throughout their life. And that was absolutely true of Matteo because it wasn't long after
this, he started to have more very close-up UFO sightings and of course started to see receive some really
profound telepathic messages and downloads from the ETSs. So, I call this
one the contacts continue. One evening around 3:00 a.m. he was outside his home
and saw a round glowing sphere flashing quote all sorts of pretty colors. It
moved overhead. It was way too low and way too bright to be a satellite. Was definitely not a plan or helicopter. I
mean, it looked no higher, he says, than 50 m, 150 ft. And as he says, as it went
over my house, it changed colors. pretty blue and green and in between tones,
really pretty, bright and then soft at the same time. And then it just slowly carried on. I guess message received on
both sides. Strange experiences continued with sleep paralysis. He would sometimes sense a presence in his room.
In November of 2022, he saw more orbs that he says were quote definitely not
satellites or meteors. Not too long ago, he received a download from the ETSs
that had a very interesting message. This download said that the power elites within government are using SCOPS and
transhumanism technology to induce contact via artificial intelligence. He
speculated that he himself might have been targeted by some of these government folks. He soon began to
receive more downloads like this and most of them were discussing the dangers of transhumanism. And as Matteo says, I
have been warned about brain implant devices, bio augmentation technology,
biotechnology that fetus growth, and that these are logical pathways once a civilization's
technological abilities become exponential. He was told that the real danger is that this technology can be
easily hidden from the public and weaponized by those in power and that this is exactly what is currently
happening here on Earth. He says the ETSs are able to reach out to those they wish to contact and they warned him that
C5 protocols can be dangerous as they may make people vulnerable to quote SCOP
manipulations. And you can see these messages are quite profound. But it also left Mattel with some stress, a little
bit of depression even. He found these experiences again to be quite isolating and difficult to deal with. But
ultimately this is what helped encourage him to go public with his experiences.
He felt that this would be therapeutic not only for him but for others because he knows that there are other people out
there having these same experiences. So he shared them as honestly and as
comprehensively and truthfully as he could and he really felt that this was
important for him and for the world. But yeah, like most contacties, his
experiences are continuing. He has been able to draw some pretty solid conclusions and has some level of
comfort, you know, living with these experiences of extraterrestrials and
high stranges. So I call this final segment conclusions from a lifetime of
experiences. To this very day, Matteo lives with great interest in and
puzzlement about his experiences and what they mean. He continues to experience electrical disturbances. He
has many out-of- body experiences. He gets frequent telepathic downloads. He
really wonders about all aspects of the UFO phenomenon and its implications for
himself and all humanity. It's something that remains a powerful force in his life and yet at the same time very
private. He knows that there is a great confusion in the field of euphology and
that many other people are struggling with similar issues and it was this that ultimately led him to share his story.
He also found out that his daughter is having experiences that really shocked him. But here's some last words from
Matteo. As he says, I have never claimed to hold the truth and be so presumptuous
as to know why the EBEs are interacting with us. In fact, after 50 years, I am
still unsure and confused to a large degree. Although the sheer numbers of experiences have been consistent, I
sometimes do feel that it is all but an illusion, too.
Yet, I must confront the facts. Physical sightings leave no doubts. Physical
scars leave no doubts. The interface and gifts are all but too real to dismiss as
just mind games and so much more. Most of all, this profound knowing is more
than just a core belief system. A lifetime of studies in metaphysics, physics, psychology, and neural
linguistics have helped tremendously to somewhat put some of the pieces of the puzzle together or glean some types of
patterns. But the overall picture is still occulted and hidden and probably
will remain so. So that is the story of Matteo Tremble's lifetime experiences
with UFOs and extraterrestrials. How amazing. So many experiences and I've
really had to summarize them to a great degree. His experiences are that extensive. But if you want to read his
whole story, please check out my book, Humanoids and High Stranges: 20 True UFO
Encounters. A whole chapter is devoted solely to Matteo's experiences and he
actually added more to them when I sent him his chapter. We went over it line by line to make sure that everything was
absolutely correct. He's a wonderful man. Again, very sensitive, very shy. He
was very concerned about remaining anonymous. He's not seeking any fame or
money from this. He just wants to share his story to help others. So, a huge
thank you to Matteo. I'm truly honored and delighted that he agreed to share his story with me and with the world.
So, that's it for today. Thank you guys so much for tuning in. I truly
appreciate it. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most important
of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next Friday. Bye.
