NIGHT OF THE UFOS
Jul 25, 2020

Summary:
Jul 25, 2020
On the evening of June 14, 1992, a massive UFO wave occurred over the small community of Topanga 
Canyon, California. Hundreds of UFOs were seen by multiple witnesses across the canyon. Objects 
hovered over homes, shot across the sky, chased cars down the road, even lifting one up in the 
sky. But the full story has never been told. Until now. This video presents brand new startling 
information about this famous case, including excerpts from phone calls made to the police, new 
eyewitnesses, photographs and more, including an apparent abduction.

On this evening, numerous people called the police, the local newspaper, and UFO groups. In this 
video, you will hear the police tape firsthand, and listen to actual witnesses reporting the 
incredible events which occurred on that evening. The night of June 14, 1992 remains one of the 
most incredible UFO events in California history, and marked the beginning of a two-year-long 
UFO wave of stupendous proportions.

My book, "UFOs over Topanga" tells the story of this UFO wave, and for those who are interested, 
is available on Amazon.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  today i'd like to talk about one of the most   amazing ufo events i've ever investigated  this is a ufo event that occurred over  
a four hour period on the evening of june  14 1992 over topanga canyon california  
you may have heard of this event i did write  a book about this event and the sightings that   followed but i can guarantee you haven't heard the  whole story because i just got some incredible new  
information about what occurred on that evening i  still have the police tape of people who called in  
to the police to report ufos  i'll be playing portions of that   throughout this presentation and uh yeah i mean  at the time i wrote the book i knew of about  
eight witnesses in five different locations who  saw activity on that night i now know of more  
than 25 witnesses in 11 different locations  so i've gotten a much clearer picture of one  
of the most amazing ufo events uh that i've ever  investigated certainly so let's just dive right in  
i became interested in ufos in 1986 following  a well-publicized sighting over alaska  
i started asking my family and friends and  found out that a bunch of them had in fact   seen ufos i joined mufon became a field  investigator i joined every group i could find  
i bought all the magazines and books  started interviewing people formally   and wrote my first article on ufos about sightings  over topanga canyon turned out several people  
i'd known several people i knew had seen ufos in  this area i one lady she was a good family friend  
sylvia walters she is a pilot a scuba diver she  lived on saddle peak at the time one of the higher  
points of tapanga and described how she had seen  this egg-shaped object with her friend it made a  
low buzzing noise and just moved slowly over the  house that was one sighting another involved two  
young teenagers three who were walking up  in trota boulevard at night this is in 1986  
and saw two star-like objects approaching from  different sides of the sky the two star-like  
objects joined together circled around each other  and went off in different directions it's a very  
unusual sighting a third sighting involved  four teenagers who lived on old topanga canyon  
they were out on their deck one evening in  february 1987 and saw first one very small  
strangely shaped object swoop over the house  followed moments later by two more a few minutes  
later a very very large object came very low over  the house maybe 50 feet 100 and shined down a beam  
of light it had little lights all around it it was  clearly strange made just as a low whooshing or  
buzzing noise and moved off this was followed by  one more object it was a veritable fleet of ufos  
and another case i investigated occurred in 1982  on mulholland highway at the north end of tapanga  
to a friend by the name of mark grant who was  with his friend one evening and just sitting  
on the hood of their car when they saw this  triangular formation of lights uh each light  
was a different color suddenly it swooped towards  them the next thing they knew it was swooping away  
that a very strong fear reaction it's  entirely possible they had missing time  
so these were four early sightings that i wrote  about in this article and did not realize at the  
time that topanga was a huge hot spot with a  history of sightings or that there was about  
to be a gigantic ufo wave of stupendous  proportions so how it all unraveled is in  
mid june of 1992 i received a call  from the editor of the messenger  
the local newspaper in topanga canyon and he  called to tell me that there had been a wave of  
sightings a bunch of people called the police two  people called the office of the messenger uh these  
people were all reporting ufos hovering over their  homes shooting across the sky chasing their car  
down the street uh one case the car was actually  lifted up off the ground in an apparent abduction  
and colin penno wanted to know if i would  investigate and see if i could find out   some information about this case uh he handed over  the police tape so yeah i was all in and i really  
buckled down and began investigating i called  the police they confirmed the event but refused  
to release any information about it other than  that they had received some calls they took my  
number and promised to refer any new callers to  me as a mufon field investigator which they did  
uh after that i started putting  up flyers i called everyone i knew   in topanga asking them if they had seen  anything on this evening of june 14 1992.  
there was a solar a partial i'm sorry there  was a partial lunar eclipse that evening  
so there should have been a lot of people outside  i was actually in topanga on that evening i had  
moved out about a year before to canoga park but  was visiting family and drove through the canyon  
around 9 9 30. i did not see anything  but what i found out was that there were  
a number of people who had seen stuff and a bunch  of calls paid off and i found two other people
two other groups of witnesses rather who had seen  ufos and since then as i mentioned earlier a bunch  
of other witnesses so i'll just start with  how events occurred on that evening amazingly  
this encounter apparently began early that morning  one couple i interviewed they live high on saddle  
peak at one of the tallest points of elevation  in topanga canyon about 2000 feet or so and they  
described something very unusual that happened  that morning they were lying in bed just about to   get up when they heard this low buzzing noise like  a transformer over their home it was very strange  
it persisted for just a few minutes and suddenly  went away and they didn't think much more about it  
the day passed normally it was a round sunset  dusk when catherine uh outlook as i call her  
that's a pseudonym looked outside and saw strange  flashes of pink lightning or what she thought was  
pink lightning it was a warm sunny day no clouds  in the sky so it was very curious and she didn't  
think much of it until she looked out again and  saw this weird pink glowing bar of light sitting  
in the sky just above the ridge sort of south and  east of their home again she didn't think much of  
it just thought it was very peculiar and they sat  down and decided to watch a video this was around  
8 pm their dog started barking shortly after  they started the video and they went outside  
to see what was wrong and saw this  glowing object hovering above the ridge  
suddenly it blinked out and another  object appeared there were two objects now   and the first object suddenly zoomed towards them  moved right over their head it lit everything up  
it looked almost triangular shaped they couldn't  quite tell because it was moving so fast  
and they watched another object  rise up from behind this ridge  
uh followed by another and each time one object  would rise up the one above it would dart away  
they saw about 10 objects maybe move off and  dart in different directions sometimes turning  
at right angles sometimes stopping and hovering  briefly before moving in another direction  
and they were just breathless  they couldn't believe it   uh it appeared to have stopped so they went back  inside but about ten maybe fifteen minutes later  
they saw more flashes of light so they ran outside  on their doorstep and watched a repeat performance  
maybe five ten objects fifteen came up  from behind this ridge hovered briefly  
and moved in various directions throughout topanga  canyon when it happened the third time catherine  
started to count these objects and it would be 10  or 20 for each episode and this went on for two  
maybe three hours uh every 10 or 15 minutes or  so another group of objects would rise up from  
behind the ridge she thought it might be military  but david also pseudonym uh said or i'm sorry  
daniel i said there was no way it could be  military he's been in the military for years we  
have nothing that can move like this at one point  one of these objects did come very close to them   scared them pretty badly but they saw this weird  symbol on the bottom which looked like a sine wave  
they didn't hear any noise it was frightening  to see all these objects one after another  
catherine became increasingly upset and after  about two or three hours of watching these things  
she counted about 200 objects i went up there to  their house they showed me where these objects  
were coming from uh daniel said you know  he's not sure if it was 200 it might have   been closer to 100 which is still way too many  so clearly something very strange was going on  
they were very badly upset they called  the police the next day the police were  
oddly curious about what they had seen but  refused to divulge any information and would  
not tell them if anyone else had called in to  report sightings uh it was a couple years later  
actually that there was a lady in malibu by the  name of judy who saw pretty much the same thing  
you can see in this photograph here  numerous 10 12 saucer shaped objects  
this is probably exactly what catherine and daniel  saw coming up from behind the ridge this was again  
two years later in malibu uh which is immediately  adjacent to topanga and this photograph pretty  
much describes exactly what they saw these  small kind of oval shaped objects rising up  
uh so yeah but they that is one group of witnesses  again they live very high and have a really good  
overview of almost the entire canyon but could  not see where these objects were coming from  
because it was from behind a ridge again  slightly south and to the east of their home  
so i found another witness years later by the name  of mark mark was in the canyon on that evening and  
it turned out he was in a location not too far  from catherine and daniel just a couple of miles  
away to the east and slightly to the south  at a place called moon fire ranch at the end  
of everding road this is high above topanga  canyon boulevard just west of it and uh  
he was there with a number of other people a  group of about five friends when they noticed this  
bright light coming up from immediately behind  a ridge to the west and slightly to the south  
and as they watched this area lit up and started  to release small objects it wasn't just one or two  
it was a number of them and this went on for  about five minutes as they watched these objects  
lighting up the ground like it was day and  completely freaked him out there was again  
no sound but if you correlate the sightings of  catherine and daniel and mark and his friends  
it appears that they these objects were coming  up from somewhere below certainly in the area of  
tuna canyon park on the south end of topanga  canyon and again these were not the only witnesses  
uh it was another early evening encounter occurred  down at venice beach a gentleman i found out about  
his sighting contacted him and he described how  he was down on venice beach when he with a number  
of other people were there he when he heard the  sound of an enormous quantity of water falling  
into the ocean he twirled around and looked out in  the ocean and saw that an enormous object had just  
come up out of the water he didn't see it actually  come up out of the water but he could still see   uh huge waterfalls of water ocean water coming off  the surface and crashing back into the ocean it  
was enormous you said the size of a stadium there  were several smaller glowing oval shaped objects  
twirling around it maybe a dozen he saw this for  only a few seconds because it immediately darted  
very quickly to the northwest kind of going up the  coastline he said really was only three seconds  
that this these objects were in view so that  that's another amazing sighting on this night uh  
years later i was actually doing a radio show when  uh i was contacted by radio host bill beaucheers  
and he told me he wanted to do a show because he  was there on june 14th 1992 uh driving through  
topanga canyon with a group of two other people  on their way back from a birthday party on that  
evening they headed south through the canyon  at around 10 p.m they had no sooner reached  
the top tapanga and were heading into the canyon  itself there's a long straight away there when  
suddenly he saw a flash of light he was driving  he pulled over and looked out and he saw this  
object darting across the sky he  jumps out of the car as did his   other two friends and saw this enormous  sort of cigar-shaped or bar of light  
hovering at he estimates three thousand feet above  it was extremely bright it cast bright light down  
on the canyon itself enough to cast shadows  uh most amazing is it was ejecting groups of  
smaller objects five or ten at a time which he  described as kind of football shaped oval-shaped  
glowing and they would dart around and dart off  and then another group of objects would come out  
and start swirling around this cigar-shaped  bar of light and take off uh he watched this  
he and his friends watched this for about 20  minutes there were other cars driving he said  
who apparently also saw this and after about 20  minutes his friends were becoming pretty upset  
he thought at first there was a movie going on but  it was clear this wasn't a movie uh he didn't know   what it was he could not identify it and his  friends were becoming upset and begged him to  
leave and finally he said okay we'll go something  he regrets to this day but he continued on driving  
so one of the people who called the topanga canyon  newspaper is dr murray clark he lived in sylvia  
park on a little road off cheney drive and he was  outside that evening around 10 maybe 11 pm when  
he saw or he looked outside he saw a star-like  object darting at super high speeds across the sky  
it was way too fast for a plane but far too slow  for a meteor it traversed the entire horizon in  
about three seconds perhaps a pretty simple  sighting but taken in a you know along with  
all these other sightings we're starting to get a  clearer picture of what's going on on this evening  
another couple that i interviewed were  not friends of mine but friends of friends  
i call them philip and mandy  they had gone to see friends in  
up in trota in the center of the canyon  on that evening to view the lunar eclipse  
and it was around midnight that they decided  to leave shortly before midnight and no sooner  
did they turn off of entrada and on to topanga  canyon boulevard heading north when they saw  
these objects there was four or five approaching  their car not far away their first thought was  
perhaps they were helicopters and there was some  sort of a drug bust they quickly rejected this  
theory because the objects were completely  silent and really brilliant and actually  
followed their car for about five miles  north all the way up through the canyon  
philip wasn't paying a whole lot of attention to  them at this time but mandy was staring at them   because she could not figure out what they were  and kept trying to say they were helicopters when  
it was clear that they weren't and finally she  says look philip i think those are flying saucers  
at this point they're heading along the  straightaway where bill beaucheers was uh where  
bill bushears and his friends had pulled  over and so they're driving along the same   long straight away it's a what a eighth of a mile  a quarter mile and they're looking to their left  
and they see at least three of these objects  now they've got they're clearly saucer shaped  
they have little lights all around them they're  below the level of the canyon they appeared to   have almost a height governor because they were  sort of following the lay of the land and uh  
mandy's joke suddenly wasn't so funny because it  was clear that these were classic flying saucers  
and they drove a little slowly did not stop but  continued driving up to the top of topanga canyon  
and down into the valley at which point  the objects stopped following them  
so it's you know probably around this time  that the police were receiving calls i'm  
pretty sure anyone who is outside that evening  uh would have seen enormous amount of activity  
i'm sure there are other witnesses but what  i'd like to do is go through some of the  
accounts of the people who called the police the  first two calls came from two separate couples  
who had eaten at the same restaurant it turns out  gladstone's for fish which is located sort of in  
the santa monica area area along the coast and  both of them headed north along the pacific coast  
highway and then turned right and up into topanga  canyon probably very close to around the same time  
another call comes from a teacher who lives  in the canyon in the center of the canyon  
and another call came from a man who was heading  south oh and there was another gentleman who also  
or a rather a lady who lived in the center of the  canyon near sassafrass the theatrical botanical  
and she lives high on the ridge and she called the  topanga messenger the next day to say that she had  
seen incredibly bright beams of light shining  down onto the boulevard colin pino asked her  
if they could have been perhaps helicopters or  headlights and she emphatically said no she's  
lived here a very long time and has never seen  anything that bright or anything quite like that  
so that's another witness so i think probably  the first one not to call the police but to have  
activity on that night was the teacher who  lived in the center of the canyon they had  
gone to bed that evening and were woken  up when the entire interior of their house  
lit up with bright light they heard  a low buzzing noise and saw this very   large glowing object hovering over  their home and i will just play this
segment of the police tape for you it's about  five maybe six minutes long i had to edit out  
a little bit of identifying uh material but  this is pretty much the entirety of the call  
do you have for lack of a better word uh  some helicopters or something flying up  
the canyon tonight they have unusually  bright lights not that i'm aware of
there's no aerial activity going on up there  not not as far as we know why what did you see  
um because about an hour ago i ended up in the  canyon and my wife and i were working there was a  
very very bright light coming above our home into  the windows and we went out to look at it because  
we could like see an extremely bright light  hovering above us but we couldn't hear anything  
um it's approximately do you  know where the sassafras nursery
yeah okay um did you hear anything or anything  besides the bright light no we didn't hear it okay
um i don't really want to get  involved with the police officer
something that we should investigate
if in fact this was truly a ufo   no no that's what i don't i don't believe in  such things well i do and if in fact there was  
then uh you know their technology is much  farther along than ours and yeah i would think  
is there any missions we just moved here about  three months ago is there military in the area
is there any military in the  area is there anyone in the area   it's military is there an air force base nation
well you know to tell you the truth  is the strangest thing i've ever seen   uh the only sort of noise we did here was  a sort of a high-pitched top do you ever  
eat at gladstone no wha wha what is that down  on the beach no i don't know the area so long
okay well what you know we'd like to come  up what you know we'd like to come up and  
investigate the area um well my wife is a [ __  ] shaken up down but i'm going to calm her down
i don't want to report the ufo officer because  i want my hair getting i don't want my name  
connected you know you won't be connected  with anything but we need to investigate   if there's somebody that's maybe doing  something illegal we need to find out  
may not have anything to do with ufos maybe  somebody that's you know some mad scientist  
or something like there's find some kind  of weird thing what is your name someone   is doing something illegal they have a hell of  a lot of wantage because the light was intense  
um has anyone else called no sir you see i  don't want my name connected with the university  
no your name is going to be involved at all other  than we just want to go up to the end know where  
you live so we can look around the area well  it's gone now and that's another thing why no  
but as quickly as it came that's how quick it  went out you know what i'm going to discuss  
this with my wife and i think what is  right which is your address all right
when i go down to panama canyon road and i hit  pacific coast highway there is a [ __ ] you want   to go sir fuel station why and i would like to  go there tomorrow when we're a little bit more  
together and make some soldiers you know  once you sleep on it tonight and then   when do you get after do you  still want to do this then  
call the stationery who would i speak with  anybody on the desktop so yeah an incredible  
sighting um clearly this thing woke them up  uh this these objects were targeting people  
they were coming right over their homes and as  you'll see chasing cars down the highway the next  
call i want to talk about the next person who  called the police is a man who was heading  
south through topanga canyon he had driven  along you know came from the valley side the  
san fernando valley and was heading south through  topanga canyon and had gotten to the part where of  
the center of the canyon when he saw these objects  chasing him down the road like philip and mandy  
he thought at first they were helicopters and  i'll just play this segment where he describes  
what he saw to the lost hills police station  this this segment is about three minutes long  
can you all tell me did you did you all have uh  helicopters up into paying the canyons and uh  
we didn't i don't know if the fire department  or if lapd did but we did not because uh  
well i was what did you say about an hour ago  i was going down over the panga canyon and  
i think they were helicopters because  they was shining damn bright lights on me  
but they kind of chased me down the the  road a bit where did you see them exactly
we almost think it though
there's a theater called the wheel  gear botanical theater you know  
it's um it's for all typing economy to do to  panic it's actually further north than that  
isn't it yeah yeah it's above by the nursery  uh nursery yeah kind of close to there yeah  
what did you see exactly but i i can't really  tell you what i saw because it was so damn bright  
but they were kind of chasing me down with  the way a bit how many of them one again
well i really don't know what to tell you  because like i say we weren't up there  
and if the fire department was up there  we would more than likely know about it  
and lapd has a small piece of japanga but it's  further down towards towards the coast area  
and they have just a very little piece of it is  there a helicopter that doesn't make anymore no
well you put off a
above from the valley
i thought maybe there was some  police activity there maybe
thank you so yeah i mean now we have what one  two three people driving along the boulevard  
who saw stuff around the same time  on that evening and i've got another  
segment of this police tape that i want to play  for you this comes from one of the couples who  
had eaten for glad stones for fish and after  having dinner that evening i'm estimating  
that they left around 10 o'clock i don't know  it's a pure guesstimate but i'm guessing they  
left around 10 p.m and we're or perhaps 11 and  we're heading up along the coast and turned right  
into topanga canyon topanga canyon is a very  rural area it's a community of about 8 000 people  
but it's one of the largest inner city state parks  in the world griffith park is around the same size  
but it's a massive sprawling wilderness  area with some very inaccessible locations  
so that might be a factor here  hard to say but the canyon does get  
very very deep it's got a little creek that  runs all the way through it uh to the ocean  
and so they headed north from the ocean up  to panga canyon boulevard at this point the  
canyon does get very deep and it's probably in  this exact area where they saw these objects  
following their car they got out  and observed them and i'll just play   the segment for you this segment is about three  minutes long the quality is not great of this tape  
but i think you'll be able to hear  what they described to the local police
is this the malibu sheriff's office we cover malwa  yes do you also cover topanga canyon this video  
well this is gonna sound very strange  officer okay i'm almost embarrassed to  
discuss this over the telephone except that  my girlfriend was a witness did anyone in   call in and report anything strange happening  in the canyon tonight around about an hour ago  
hour and a half no they didn't what happened well my girlfriend and i saw three very strange  
god who does one report ufos to the air force  the air force well either fish spiked our  
uh put something in our wine or we're  hallucinating because we saw something   really weird tonight driving up to the panga  canyon okay what did you see we saw three ufos  
discs flying discs in the canyon where  were you in the canyon real high up past  
sassafras nursery where the canyon gets real deep  whether they look like they were saucers i mean  
they were saucers and then they were  they were following us above our car  
and then all of a sudden we stopped  the car and we got out and we saw them   we saw we we watched them and within i'd say three  seconds like a bat out of hell they just went  
they were gone they went straight up in the  air did they do anything no i'm just fly by no  
no they didn't do anything to us they just flew  by and i was wondering if there was any like   uh atmospheric disturbances tonight or any  kind of water balloons or something nothing  
we thought maybe there's a possibility they  were helicopters except it didn't make any noise  
well i know my girlfriend and i we both watched  it we just got home now i mean i don't live in  
malibu but i was just very curious to finally to  find out if anyone else had reported something  
how's that well maybe like i said maybe gladstone  spiked our wine so it's the air force you report  
these things to us yes so what would you wouldn't  happen to have their number which you know  
they'll probably just think we're nuts  anyhow well i guess there's nothing much   more that can be said i'd be interested in knowing  if anyone else saw anything nobody called us well
i don't know we saw what we saw so  i guess maybe we had too much wine  
all right thanks sorry to keep okay all right
so yeah they saw three saucers uh they were  clearly upset and about it and didn't know what to  
think uh but recognize that these were not normal  objects ufos and uh like the other callers we're  
very interested to see if anyone else had seen  something not sure why the police denied it uh  
but uh more on that later there is one other group  of witnesses i'd like to talk about now and that's  
the other couple who also ate at gladstone for  fish that evening it's a remarkable coincidence  
i'm guessing they were pretty close to this  other couple in terms of proximity and time  
but they did not know each other and had decided to go  
up the coast after eating a gladstones for fish  and decided they were going to drive through  
to panga canyon i think it's probably a decision  that they regret for the last rest of their lives  
because they ended up having one of the most  terrifying experiences of their life when one of  
these objects followed their car down the highway  struck them be with a beam of light lifted them up  
into the sky set them back down a short time later  and they got home they say by the grace of god now  
i want to play this five-minute segment from the  police tape this segment is of terrible quality  
i apologize for that but if you persist it gets  a little bit better and uh it's just four or  
five minutes long and they describe exactly what  they saw on that evening to the lost hills police
okay did anyone report anything strange tonight  uh me i would have been watching uh strange  
white light now that i know i'll  let this believe it first we are
my girlfriend and i have no history of  psychotic problems for hallucinations
what exactly happened
you know where the canyon gets really deep
and we had a very uneasy feeling because it  was moving and we both felt it was following us  
oh okay all of a sudden on top of  us was just extremely bright objects
i have never been more frightened  in my life okay what happened then  
we were put down we lost our memory for i  don't know how long maybe a couple minutes
and it wasn't there anymore okay i don't believe  in these things i'm telling you i'm a normal human  
being i have a job a good job my girlfriend  has a good job she's a nurse my camera is  
we are very disorientated   we've gone home by the grace of god and my  girlfriend was near desperate hysterical
we're not drinking we don't take any  drugs at all we're just normal people
well now we don't believe that someone  doesn't fall under our jurisdiction  
should i report this to anyone or should i just  break it up i i don't know what people think  
well that's hard to say you know we like to  go visit that uh doctor or something like that  
we are very nauseous very very nice and
well i think you should probably go see uh medical  doctor and you know if you are some type of
um
uh
so yeah you can see how upset they were from  this call what's amazing and this is the new  
information i got is uh they called the national  ufo reporting center the next day this i did not  
know this i just recently got a hold of this  interview in the new fork archives online  
and it's an incredible interview it's about 10  minutes long and the husband describes in detail  
exactly what happened on that evening it's a  lot more than he initially revealed in some ways  
they did have physiological effects they  received burns like a sunburn blisters and  
lasting i think psychological effects so  i'll just play this incredible interview  
from new fork for you again  it's about 10 minutes long
ufo reporting center calling from los angeles  yes i've got to make this fairly short because  
i'm going to get back to my doctors at 2 30. um  the faa and the air force gave me this number yes  
and i'd like to report something that happened to  my girlfriend and i last night to paying a canyon   okay would you describe it please and by the way  we called the malibu police and they said that  
three other people had reported similar things  it's just nothing that's more imagining okay um we  
were driving up coast highway number one pacific  coast highway are you familiar with that area  
and we backtracked and went decided to go up to  panga canyon road which is a uh it goes pretty  
high up into the canyon country do you know where  japan and canyon is yes okay with it all right  
there's a place where old topanga canyon  goes to new topanga canyon it's there's a  
real high ledge that goes deep deep down  you can overlook the canyon okay at any rate
it gets weirder as it goes on out  of nowhere appeared over our car a  
brilliant brilliant brilliant light that was  hovering about i'd say 50 feet on top of our car
and uh at first we thought  it was a helicopter a police   helicopter or something except that we  realized that we didn't hear any sound  
and we looked up and we could see  clearly the defined shape of a uh
a pie shaped object a saucer i mean i  hate to use that term saucer type object  
there was a rim we could see  a rim and then within the rim   was this just one big brilliant brilliant  light that they kept shining on our car  
okay was this like a beam of light yes okay  was that in the form of a beam or a cone
um it was a uh wide cone okay a  wide cone covered oh i'd say a good  
maybe 50 feet in diameter okay but it was very  very bright and anyway we turned the car around  
and we decided to go back down the canyon  and this damn thing kept following us it kept  
at the speed we were going at the same speed we  were going it was following us it was above our  
car about 50 feet and we kept looking up and it  kept it was there and if we would go faster it  
would go faster if we would slow down it would  slow down and we had the distinct impression  
that was pursuing us and the only noise that  i could i felt that we could hear was uh um  
the sound that a transformer would make like  a hum all right a high-pitched tongue okay  
then i told my girlfriend we better get out  of here so i accelerated the car but you've  
got to be very careful on defending  a canyon because it's a very windy
it's a very windy road and uh when i  tried to accelerate the car my engine  
went out the lights went out everything went  out okay and we got out of the car thinking  
that we were going to run away i'm telling you  my girlfriend was almost to the state of hysteria  
in fact later on i we went to sinai emergency room  when i got home when we got to our homes here um
when we got out of the car we got even a better  look at it we we saw that it was not a helicopter
and within i'd say seconds  
it just went straight up in the air and as quickly  as it appeared that's how quickly it vanished okay  
and anyway we got back into the car and the car  started and we got down to the coast highway  
we came home to los angeles and my girlfriend was  very very badly shaken up she's a nurse i'm an  
accountant uh we went to cedars-sinai emergency  room and uh we had broken out on in blisters  
on the backs of our hands my girlfriend where  she was wearing a necklace you could see  
the mark where the necklace was i  wear glasses you could see on my face   glass the glass mark and we have a  very nauseous all night and diarrhea
and i sure didn't have it we didn't  have this when we went out that we  
but anyway we did call the  malibu police when we got home   and they said that three other people  had called concerning similar incidents  
that evening the same area in the same  area canyon area there was an officer
and we're going to go back to the  doctors today at 2 30 so i can't   stay too long and i don't want  to get terribly involved but  
even the doctor said i should i i could  report this i don't i'm not prone to
these far out situations sir but it was the most  amazing thing i've ever seen in my life and really   quite frightening okay that was your girlfriend  at rn yes okay now what time did that occur it  
occurred up i would say approximately 12 in the  evening that's this morning yes my girlfriend  
works do you have any estimate of the diameter of  the object it was about 50 feet in diameter okay
now do you remember the  color of that cone of light um white okay white was uh but there was  some blue and a blue around the edges  
okay now when you were exposed to that beam of  light did you detect any change of temperature
no but our skin tingled okay and it felt like  there was a little i don't know electrical  
feeling in your skin okay and then for a  brief moment to tell you the truth neither  
of us even could remember what happened  it was almost as if we had blacked out  
did you feel that that was a very short duration  i think so i have no way of knowing okay
did you detect any unusual orders  at the time come to think of it yeah
uh i would say
like bert cinnamon okay did you  have any trouble restarting your car
at that point i can't to tell  you the truth i can't remember   i i don't know i think maybe a couple  clicks and started i can't remember  
okay have you seen any other problems  with the car since you got home  
okay now were there any other unusual physical  traces with you or your lady friend no okay
and how long do you feel  this entire incident went on
i feel that it followed us for about 10 minutes  and then out of the car maybe a minute or so  
but it was when we were out  of the cars when i kind of   kind of lost track of what was going on  for a while okay do other people report  
things like this yes sir they sure have  they've been reporting them for years  
now what was the name of the doctor you're  going to well we went to the cedar sinai
we are going to go see a psychiatrist
yes okay could i get your name sir i don't want to  give my name okay is there any way we can get back  
to you if we need more information well what more  information would you need i'll i'll i'm going to  
go back to the doctors i can't call you back it's  just my wife my girlfriend has a governmental job
okay what would you like to  do after you visit your doctor   if you feel like it i would like to hear  what his diagnosis of the injuries is
and what do they do with all the stability what  do we do with it well we compare it with other  
similar cases over the past years which gives us a  basis for determining the reality of what is going  
on is this something that the government is doing  no no the uh this type of incident has occurred  
uh off and on and throughout the united  states and overseas for the last 40 years
i've read about things like this but reading it  is one thing but when you see it firsthand i i  
don't know how to explain it i don't know  how to explain it it can be very traumatic  
and other other people do call you oh yes  we get we're average about six calls or six  
reports a day right now and that's very  very quiet we cover all of north america
well what is stock what is this thought to be
well there's of course three or four different  uh theories my own personal opinion is that  
these are objects coming in from outer space  and i've been studying this subject for 36 years
jesus christ
so there you go i mean you can see that whatever  occurred on that evening it was stupendous  
uh so yeah over two dozen witnesses more than  10 different locations throughout topanga canyon  
space no more than 10 20 miles from  each other all saw stuff on this night  
some were lucky they just saw you know ufos  hovering over their home or rising up from  
behind the ridge at least four or five people  claimed that their they were chased down the  
highway and yes apparently there was one abduction  uh the sightings did not stop here it was very  
strong for the next two years there were more  car chases some landings a few abductions uh one  
guy saw a ufo drop out of the sky came right  back up wondering if that was an abduction  
where they picked someone up uh way way  too many i'm settings to go into here  
that'll have to be another presentation because  i just wanted to focus on the incredible events  
of june 14th 1992. i will say that there have  been many many photographs taken of ufos as you  
have seen and i had my own sightings on at least  five ten different locations almost always or yeah  
always really of anomalous lights that i certainly  could not explain sometimes i was alone during  
these sightings but most i was with other people  who ood and odd when they saw this stuff too  
so it was an extremely active air  time in this area topanga canyon  
and has since slowed down a little bit  but is still having incredible activity
so yeah that's it if anyone has any information  about what occurred on june 14 1992 i would  
certainly love to hear it but until then  thanks for listening and keep having fun
