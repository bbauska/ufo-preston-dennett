THE ALIEN IN MY BED: THE UFO & ET CONTACTS OF MIKE W.
Jan 24, 2025

Summary:
Jan 24, 2025
People across the world are reporting direct contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Cases reach back more than 100 years and number in the many thousands, or as some researcher believe, in the millions. Researchers have discovered that contact is often generational, following certain family lines. As a general rule, it begins in early childhood and continues throughout a person’s life. This video presents the contact experiences of Mike W, a retired apartment manager originally from Norman, Oklahoma. His encounters include events that are both typical and commonly reported, as well as unique elements of extreme high strangeness.

Born in 1945, Mike’s experiences began in the early 1950s. Around age five, Mike would periodically and inexplicably disappear from his home. His parents and family would search for him, and find him sometimes miles from their home on a random street corner. Mike has no memories of these missing time encounters, but his parents assured him that it happened many times. Around that time, his parents extracted what appeared to be a strange, tiny, ceramic rod from his arm. In hindsight, Mike wonders, could this have been an alien implant?

Years passed with no unusual experiences. Mike moved to Portland, Oregon. And on May 11, 1970, Mike (now 25 years old) had a series of three consecutive encounters on that day that would leave him baffled for the rest of his life. The first occurred while walking down the sidewalk in downtown Portland, near the local University where a series of anti-war protests had escalated to riots that would garner national headlines. Mike noticed two seven-foot-tall, identical-looking gentleman wearing dark suits walking towards him. They confronted him and told him, “We can take you anytime we feel like it.” A short conversation followed, and the men identified themselves as CIA agents. Mike didn’t believe them, but shocked and afraid, he turned and ran.

Later that night, he was walking down Jefferson Street when he saw a crowd of people watching a fight in front of a bar. Mike’s attention was drawn to two tall, identical-looking gentlemen standing behind the crowd observing intently. The two men were seven feet tall, dressed identically in ankle-length brown robes and golden Nefertiti-like headwear. Also odd was that nobody seemed to notice them. Even stranger, they held their hands out in a peculiar way. Curious about their weird appearance and behavior, Mike stood next to them and asked them what they were doing. One of them replied that they were reading people’s minds to determine what was going on. Mike offered to investigate for them and almost ended up getting involved in the bar fight. When he turned around, the men were gone. Only then did he wonder, were they the same men who had confronted him earlier?

Walking back home, he had his third and strangest encounter. An attractive woman dressed in the same kind of ankle-length brown robe approached him and said, “I need to have sex with you.” It was an offer Mike couldn’t resist, and he took the woman home. Making love, he was shocked to find that the woman’s anatomy had some profoundly strange abnormalities. Her skin seemed rubbery. She began to communicate to him telepathically. And at one point, he looked at her and was shocked to see that she appeared to be bald. After being intimate, she left without a word and was gone. After thinking about it and the other two encounters, he began to wonder if all three encounters were connected, and were the people he had seen even human?

Years later, one night in 1988, Mike (now living in northern California) went up to the mountains overlooking the San Francisco Bay to play with his ham radio. Shortly after parking, he realized a brilliant light was shining down on him. Exiting his car, he turned and saw a gigantic craft hovering right above a hill a short distance away. It was not normal, and Mike stood there in awe. The next thing he knew, he had a lapse of consciousness and the craft was in a different place. It then disappeared in a flash. Mike forgot about the entire incident until he had a series of terrifying dreams of being taken inside a craft and examined by gray ETs. Recalling his sighting and missing time, he realized he had been abducted by aliens.

Following this encounter, weird things began to happen. He developed an interest and advanced knowledge of electronics. He exhibited psychic abilities that were so powerful, he vowed to never use them again. The encounter also changed his view of the world and his place in it. Eventually, he would have another UFO sighting that convinced him he was being watched by extraterrestrials.

Mike is just one of many people who are reporting UFO and extraterrestrial experiences. The complete story of his contacts is presented in my book, Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters , now available. LINK: https://amzn.to/3CaANiI

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal
today I'm going to be talking about one man's lifelong experiences with UFOs and
extraterrestrials the title of today's episode is called the alien in my bed
the UFO and ET contacts of Mike W his story is presented in my book humanoids
in high strangeness his story is super interesting again he's had life lifelong
experiences and these include pretty much the entire range of UFO encounters
including sightings missing time face-to-face contact with both Grays and
human-looking ETS an onboard experience that's really incredible as well as some
very interesting and unique psychic experiences that are apparently a direct
result of his onboard UFO experience his story is really amazing I'm very excited
to share it with you today so let's just get started and I'm going to go through
this chronologically from childhood onward and the first section I'm going to talk about is his early
experiences although Mike's family was originally from Norman Oklahoma his
father was a career military officer and he had joined the Marines at a pretty young age he worked as an aircraft
mechanic and fought in both World War II and the Korean War he rose in rank
eventually becoming a master sergeant and at one point he worked for NASA as a
head of security and in fact he was involved in the development says mike of
the Avro Flying Saucer and an experimental vertical takeoff aircraft
so his career often involved assignments in different locations now in the early
1950s 5-year-old Mike found himself living in Southern California it was at
this age that Mike's family encountered a strange problem with him he kept disappearing from the house now Mike has
no memory of this but over and over again his parents told him he would turn up missing of course a search would
ensue and more often than not Mike would be found far from the house standing on a random street corner this happened
repeatedly and each time the whole family including aunts and uncles would fan out and begin to search and when
when they would find him they always questioned him what happened how did you get out of the house what are you doing
Mike had no answers other than to say that he was waiting for the light to turn blue as he says I don't remember
anything as far as that just what they told me and they just tell me these stories that I went missing all the time
these early experiences certainly fit the pattern we see with so many contact
as you may know contact off often does start at a very early age and continues
on through adulthood and that's certainly true with Mike with all these very early missing Time episodes I also
find it interesting that his father was pretty highly placed in the military
that's another P pattern we do see sometimes it's not a hard and fast rule but it does turn up so that's also very
intriguing but certainly this is just the beginning with shortly after these
Early Childhood experiences that another event occurred which really pointed towards him being a contact and having
had fullon physical experiences and this is one involving an apparent alien
implant there were other strange incidents it was around the same age five or six Mike was riding in the car
with his parents and his sister and this is when he noticed a strange red bump on his arm with a white center and he first
thought it was a pimple tried to squeeze it and that's when he noticed that the White Center was actually a hard solid
object of some kind a tiny white cylinder about an e/ inch wide unable to
get it out of his arm he showed it to his mother and asked her if she thought it might be a pimple and she said I've
never seen a pimple that looked like that before let me try to get it out and Mike's dad said no let him do it so Mike
tried again squeezing this quote pimple but the little white rod in the center
would poke up out of his skin and just slide right back in So finally his mom tried and after several physically
painful attempts she finally succeeded in extracting this object and as Mike
says she held it it looked like white ceramic she told him I've never seen
anything like this before and this is when Mike's father immediately said rode
away and his mother obeyed she opened the car window tossed little white Rod alongside the road now years later in
hindsight in learning about alleged alien implants Mike wonders if this
object in his arm had been deliberately placed there and was in fact an implant
oh interesting is that such a shame that they didn't keep this implant his father
seemed pretty determined to get rid of it I wonder about that that's certainly
interesting but I will say that I think the vast majority of contes if not all
of them do have implants and as you can see it's certainly true in Mike's case
so he's fitting the pattern we see with so many contactees and shortly after this
another event occurred which I found super interesting in his father
mentioning a connection to the constellation of Orion now working for
NASA Mike's father was no stranger to the idea of UFOs and alien ions while he
never admitted to any of his own encounters he would sometimes come home from his job at Nasa with some
interesting stories one evening Mike and his family were standing out in the backyard looking at the stars Mike's
father began pointing out constellations to Mike and when he got to the constellation of Orion he told Mike do
you see those three little stars and Mike said yeah and Mike's father said
well that last star on that line is where we come from Mike's mom turned to
her husband and said don't tell the children that Mike's father just kind of chuckled and said okay but it was a
strange thing to say and it made a deep impression on Mike especially because Mike's father said that the folks at
Nasa were deeply interested in that third star in the Orion constellation so
other than that Mike's childhood was fairly typical but as a young man at age
22 a day came that changed how he viewed everything because on that day he would
have three separate encounters with what he believes are human-looking
extraterrestrials that is a very brief experience but I think quite significant because I have to say the constellation
Orion has come up in a number of firsthand contact stories that I've
investigated I think we do have a connection to it it's been cited as the Gray's home world so perhaps Mike's
father knew more than he was letting on it's certainly intriguing but from this point Mike grew
up without any really obvious unusual or unexplained experiences with UFOs or
otherwise but when he reached 25 years old he started to have some really
interesting experiences and in fact he had three encounters on one day May 11
1970 which as it turns out is a pretty significant day not only for him but for
United States history uh his F first encounter involves an apparent
confrontation with alleged CIA agents but he's not so sure that they were CIA
agents he's now wondering if they might in fact have been human-looking ETS it was May 11th 1970 Mike had moved
to Portland Oregon and it turns out on that day student students from Oregon
State University were holding protests against the ongoing Vietnam War in fact
the students took over the Park area and the protests quickly became violent and
before long they were garnering National headlines this turned out to be a pretty big deal now Mike wasn't a protester
himself but early that day he was walking in the city near the area of the
protests when he saw two oddl looking men ahead of him on the sidewalk he said
their appearance was striking both were nearly 7 ft tall had very pale
complexions dark eyes and were dressed in suits and furthermore they appeared
to have their gazes fixed on Mike and were walking directly towards him so
Mike thought to himself uh-oh these guys want something at this point they were about 30 ft away and as Mike says I kept
walking towards them I got up to them they stopped and I stopped so at this
point the two men stared at him intently and one of them spoke and said you know
we can take you anytime we feel like it so Mike was taken AB he said what he
thought to himself what the hell are these guys talking about and one of them asked him why are you doing this now
this confused Mike as he says I didn't know what they meant then I thought
maybe they mean about the protesting and I explained to them we are trying to bring all the Vets back home from
Vietnam and stop all the killing and stop all the stupidity and the man told him kind of menacingly well we're
CIA so Mike stared back at them thinking what the hell cuz these men sure didn't
look like CIA agents to him and in fact they both looked almost identical they
had large dark eyes long straight noses very pale skinn both were so tall they
looked really weird he felt like they were just presenting themselves as CIA
but whoever they were he was not happy about it and in fact it scared him pretty badly he knew he had done nothing
wrong certainly not that he was aware of but it was clear that these guys were somewhat menacing so not knowing how to
react he just turned and ran as he says I just kind of looked at them took a
couple of steps back turned and I hauled butt I ran as fast as I could and Mike
kept running without looking back until he was sure he had lost them and afterward he just kind of chocked it up
as a bizarre encounter with two very strange men but little did he know the strangeness on that day had only just
begun how bizarre is that the fact that they singled him out he didn't even know
them the questions that they were asking him certainly do reflect a theme we see
in so many ET contact stories where ETS show a concern about war and aggression
and how we treat not only ourselves but each other and this planet so that certainly fits the pattern there but
again this was just the beginning of the high strangeness of that day and this next encounter is off the charts bizarre
I've never heard anything quite like it um Mike is fairly certain that these
were human-looking ETS that he met in a public place and this one is called this
is the second enover for that day and I call this one the aliens at the bar after that encounter with those two
men he went home and later that evening decided to take a walk up Jefferson to
where there was a group of businesses including a movie theater and a bar it was a great hangout location something
fun to do but as he arrived he saw a large crowd of people clustered around
the entrance to the bar as he got closer he wondered what the excitement was all about everyone was facing the bar and
had their backs to him and as Mike says I noticed that at the back of the crowd
there were these two really tall people they had on Brown robes going all the way down to the ground and on their
heads they had these gold hats that looked like Nefertiti just like that
except they were a little bit taller instead of a flat top they were slightly convex and they were standing away from
the crowd so I walked up behind them and I was thinking who in the heck are these
guys now these two men were both pretty much identical in appearance dark eyes
long noses pale skin both stood about 7 ft tall but with the tall hats looked
almost 8 ft tall according to Mike they stuck out like sore thumbs and yet
strangely no one else seemed to notice them standing there they were standing side by side staring at the crowd but
even stranger was what they were doing with their hands both had their left arm
extended forward in front of them and were holding their palms vertical except for the index finger which was bent at
90° pointing towards the crowd and resting on their thumbs this is somewhat
similar to the well-known Gan mudra position of the hands used for
meditation now at that age Mike was a bit of a mischievous Joker so he saddled
up next to the two men and began to imitate their strange po posture and hand positions as he says I did the same
thing without really looking at them I just stood there like that and looked at them out of the side of my eye and
didn't say anything after a few moments of silence and really wondering who these
characters were he decided to break the silence and he told them I really like
your hats the man standing next to him said thank you but never wavered his
gaze from the crowd so Mike asked him what are you doing and the man replied enigmatically we're
reading their minds this shocked Mike and he echoed you're reading their minds
the men didn't respond but kept looking straight at the crowd with that really peculiar hand gesture so this intrigued
Mike he turned and gave him a closer look and said let me tell you about the
crowd you don't need to do that he's not sure why he said that but the man turned and looked at him with slight surprise
and said we don't and Mike said no I'll go find out what's going on and tell you what's happening and the man said you
would do that for us and Mike said yeah I'll do it so at that time Mike didn't
quite make the connection that these could be the very same men he had encountered earlier that day perhaps
they weren't but in hindsight he says they did have the same physical appearance but now dressed in robes and
those strange gold hats he was more struck by their odd costume and in particular to these hats he couldn't
tell what they were made of fabric or metal but they looked like dull burnished gold with shiny metal flakes
they fit very snugly over their heads coming down slightly around the front side of the ears like sideburns but not
only were their clothes odd so is their appearance and this time Mike got an even closer look when the man turned and
spoke to him he could see that these guys eyes were deep black from Iris to
pupil so they were not only dressed St strangely they looked strange and even their behavior was odd as Mike says when
I turned and looked at them I got the feeling real deep that these guys were not normal that was my feeling and I
thought I'm going to cooperate with these guys whatever they need because there's something different about them
so Mike stopped imitating that weird hand gesture and began to make his way
into the center of the crowd pushing his way to the front he saw that there were two young men men getting ready to fight
each other and to his surprise he recognized one of them as his friend a buddy who had just come back from the
military service in the Army without thinking and being a large
strapping young man himself he instantly inserted himself into the melee he turned to his friend's opponent
and said hey that's my friend and you're not going to do anything to him so the
man turned and focused his aggressions on Mike and the two began circling each other until someone else shouted stop
the cops are going to come of course the law enforcement was already on high alert due to the riots that had occurred
earlier that day so the two stopped and the guy said let's take this around back
Mike said fine so the two of them walked around behind the bar followed by Mike's Army buddy at which point Mike's
opponent jumped forward and started wrestling Mike's friend stepped in and said you want me to kick his ass and
Mike said no no so by this time the whole argument had cooled off all three of them walked back
to the bar the crowd had started to disperse and Mike looking over to where
these strange tall robed men had been saw that they were gone he wondered once again who could these guys be were they
the same men he had seen earlier that day why were they dressed like that why were they holding their hands that way
were they truly able to read people's minds like they said so all these questions were swirling around round in
his mind he wanted to ask them but they were gone which he was a little disappointed about but there was nothing
he could do so he went into the bar had a drink with his buddy and after a little while decided to retire home for
the evening and it was just a short walk to his home and this is when something
even stranger occurred that is super strange no matter how you look at it these were clearly not normal people
maybe they were Earth people maybe not I think Mike would have not thought a whole lot of it even with that earlier
encounter with these alleged CI agents if it wasn't for what happened shortly later because again there were three
encounters on this one day and this third and final one for this day
certainly seems connected to the other two and definitely extraterrestrial in
nature I mean there's no doubt about it certainly not in Mike's mind and as you hear his encounter I think you'll agree
it is very very strange again this is another type of experience that I've
heard somewhat similar accounts but not quite like this I call this one
encounter number three the alien in my bed Mike was not too far from his home
just walking along the sidewalk there were a few other people there it was pretty late when this woman approached
him from behind and started walking right next to him so he turns and looks at this woman and say is surprised to
see that she's wearing the same type of ankle length Brown robe that the two men
had been wearing in front of the bar this woman was of normal height pretty attractive she had shoulder length brown
blonde hair very well-kept Mike couldn't see much of her body beneath the robe but she was very pretty
he was a bit puzzled as to why she was staring at him and then she said something that really caught him off
guard in a calm and assertive voice she said I need to have sex with you now Mike's a
young man he eyed her up and down thinking wow this is really my night and
he said sure So she wordlessly followed him home Mike led her into the bedroom
and showed her the bed she lay flat on her back and opened her robe she had no
clothes on other than the robe and I'm not going to go into too much detail
here but Mike undressed and they became intimate and this is when he discovered
that her Anatomy was not quite normal I go into much more detail on this in the
book but I'll just leave it there and uh despite this he was already in the heat
of passion and they became intimate and this is when she started communicating
telepathically with him this also caught him off guard she was starting to give him instructions on how to be intimate
with her so this was really really curious to him but he followed her
instructions he said she acted very strangely when he kissed her she would make this cooing sound like a pigeon
makes sort of a Trill uh and he said her skin was not normal either as he says when her when I
kissed her on the neck her skin was almost rubbery I want to say rubbery like not like skin it was just weird so
after they had been intimate um she got off the bed started to walk out the room
as Mike says no words were exchanged she walked to the door then she paused and
looked back at me she just stood there looking staring at me and I thought she was trying to tell me something now this
is when something really strange happened Mike had a very brief impression that This Woman's appearance
was being somewhat cloaked and that she actually didn't have hair but was bald as he says I don't remember seeing hair
was just like a bare head and then she just turned and walked out so Mike has
no idea why at this point he didn't jump off the bed show her out of his house or follow her to see where she went instead
he just lay there and went to sleep and he never heard nor saw her again but the
next day after he thought about everything that had happened he really began to wonder who were those tall men
that had accosted him on the street what did they mean when they say they could take him anytime they wanted who were
these men at the bar who said that they could read people's minds could this woman be related to them might they not
have been human it didn't seem possible but everything about them was strange
and when future events would occur he would now look back on this one day and Wonder Could these people have been
human-looking extraterrestrials but the weirdest event was Yet to Come very very strange Mike
is fairly certain that that lady was in fact an extraterrestrial and again there
are cases very much like this uh and ETS do show an interest in human
reproduction or collecting genetic materials from both men and women
producing hybrid babies that looks like what was going on in this case but the
whole nature of the experience is a little bit different often this would occur on board a craft not in this case
it occurred in his bedroom I want wonder if this ET was in some to some degree in
Disguise G given that he had that brief glimpse of this lady looking quite
different bald no hair and so forth what an unusual case and that was
it for quite some time it wasn't until many years later when he was in his 40s
that he had another encounter and this one was definitely L his closest of all
his encounters he was actually taken on board it's an incredible story very
detailed and he was able to recall it fully consciously and it began with a
sighting this event began with an incredible UFO sighting it was a beautiful clear night in 1988 he
estimates this is in the San francisc Bay Area of Northern California Mike now
about age 39 had decided to travel up into the foothills of the nearby mountains to test out his ham radio and
he knew a perfect spot there was a little pull out off Skyline Boulevard you can see it here it overlooks the
city is very high in altitude to provide clear radio reception it was a pretty
popular spot among the locals who called it the logs it was an open location mostly rural lots of woods around there
was a small Housing Development not too far away Mike had been interested in ham radios for many years he had been to
this location before and knew he would be able to reach people at Great distances so he took his Jeep up there
arrived around 11:00 p.m. and began to search for someone to talk to he immediately reached somebody began a
conversation turned out this man that he was talking to on the radio was not too
far away at Mount Diablo which was in direct sight line of Mike's location on
the other side of San Francisco Bay so Mike sat in his Jeep talking and this is
when he noticed a bright illumination coming from behind his Jeep he first
thought it was another car pulling in but when this light remained and no other car appeared he started to become
curious he told the men on the radio to hang on a moment now there is a small
hill behind Mike which Ro Rises about 75 ft above the road Mike got out of his
Jeep turned to investigate the source of this light and as Mike said says this
bright light just lit up the whole area I looked up and here is this craft just
above the hill it had to be at least 100 150 ft across it was this gigantic craft
it had two light beams coming down from the bottom so you can see Mike's illustration of this craft that he saw
and as soon as he sees this he noticed that there's an oppressive silence over the entire area the craft was making no
sound but all the animal noises seized as well the craft itself was oval-shaped
had a metallic dark blue gray color no real reflection that he could see was
featureless except for the bottom which had two massive rectangular panels side
by side and each panel seemed to be covered with what looked to mik like thick transparent crystal-like
windows and Behind These he could see rows of small inverted white pyramidal
shapes and looking at them it looked like there was about 24 pyramids four
across Six Wide total of 48 and each pyramid had a small glowing ball of what
looked like plasma to him at the very tip now two Smoky beams of blue white
light were shining down from these windows conforming exactly to the same rectangular shape but Fanning out
slightly as they illuminated the hilltop below and this craft was no more than 75
ft away and moving at a snail's pace over the hilltop so Mike stared in awe it was
immediately obvious to him this was not anything normal he thought to himself I'm seeing something really really
different what the heck and as Mike says I had no fear my astonishment was at
such a high level that there was no fear I'm looking at this thing and I'm thinking oh my God
what is this wow I was just mesmerized I wasn't scared I was more interested in
what this was this craft was so enormous and these beams of light were so bright
that Mike figured somebody else had to be seeing this thing so he dashed back to his Jeep picked up his radio and
contacted this man he was talking to over on Mount Diablo told him what he was seeing and asked this man if he
could see anything so the man agreed to look and a few moments later called Mike back and said yeah I see it I see it and
Mike said dude I'm right under that thing so the guy was really impressed
he's like wow I do I see it so at this point Mike hung up his ham radio exited
his Jeep again to investigate and staring up he noticed another weird detail between these little white
pyramid type protrusions on the base of the craft there were what looked like little glow
wires or tubing running kind of crosswise the length of the two windows in a weird sine wave pattern this craft
was still moving as Mike says I noticed it slowly coming towards me really
really slowly like it was trying to sneak up on me or something I just stood there and watched it at that point I
must have blacked out because my next memor is the craft is directly over me in my Jeep and I'm looking directly up
into this thing into those two inset rectangles and of course it's shining
down on me as I'm looking up I blacked out for a second and the next thing I
know the craft is back over the top of the hill where I first saw it I don't
remember it moving but it was back over the top of the hill it was right where I first saw it and I'm just standing there
looking at it not thinking anything except I'm looking at this craft I'm looking at it just amazed it's the most
fantastic thing I've ever seen in my life now at this point without any
warning the craft instantly disappeared as Mike says it just blinked out it was
gone it was just there and then it's not there it just wasn't there either it
left so fast my eyes couldn't pick it up or it's almost like it imploded on
itself but in an instant just whoos and it was gone so Mike squinted stared
above the Hilltop and there was nothing there and as he says I could not believe
what I had just seen he was in somewhat of a days he stumbled back into his Jeep
turned on the ham radio and tried to raise the man that he had been talking to on Mount Diablo but strangely he was
gone so as mik says I just sat there with a Blank Stare looking out at the
bay area and the lights this is when suddenly a woman's voice broke in on the radio and began speaking and she said
it's been such a weird night out here there's some guy up on a hill somewhere talking about UFOs so Mike thought wow
what the heck at this point this is where Mike's memory ends and in fact he
has no memory of turning off the radio or even driving home and in fact he says
he completely forgot about the entire UFO sighting almost as if it had been
erased from his mind and as he says what really gets my attention other than
having a strange craft just a little over your head is the fact that I did not think about it other than the time
it happened for quite a while that in itself is just weirder than hell to me
as you can see that is more than just a simple sighting I've come to learn that when someone has a very close up
sighting the chances of there being deeper levels of contact go are much
higher the closer the craft is to a person the greater the chance that this was an onboard experience or there some
deeper levels of contact there given the fact that he completely forgot about it for a little while and clearly had
missing time these are huge red flags that he was taken on board and he soon
found out he was because he recalled spontaneously what happened during this
missing time and his memories of what happened on board are truly amazing it
was quite a scary experience for him but ultimately it had a really profound impact on his life and in some ways it
turned out to be a very good experience for him in terms of waking him up both
mentally emotionally and spiritually and psychically it was just a few days after
this incredible sighting involving apparently missing time that Mike began to have a series of very Vivid
repetitive dreams of actually being taken on board this craft and and physically examined by what he describes
as very scary looking gray ETS these dreams were very consistent
they never varied in detail and they replayed over and over again and after a
few weeks of this this is when Mike remembered his sighting and the fact that he had experienced missing time and
he realized came to the conclusion that his dreams were revealing what had
happened to him that he had been pulled on board this craft and he remembered all of it in Vivid
detail what he does not remember is how he got on board he found himself just suddenly there as Mike says I was laying
down on something and there were these three white beings at the foot of where I was lying one was directly at the foot
of this thing and he was bent over and his face was right in my face he was
just inches away from my face just staring directly into me and he looked
like a typical gray but there skin was just pure white the corners of their
eyes extended to the back of their heads they had two creases between their eyes like they were frowning and mad they had
two little holes where a nose would be and then just a little tiny slit where a
mouth would be the chin came down to a point not sharp but pretty much a point
and their heads were bulbous in the back these guys were scary looking if you saw
one you would turn around the other way I guarantee it they were scary looking
they were not like all those drawings you see of the Grays benign Little Creatures running around these guys were
evil looking you could tell they were mean just by the expression alone so the room he was in was Brantly
lit with white light he said he said there was no specific light source the entire room just seemed to Glow with
white light Mike realized that he was unable to move he felt almost as if he was pinned down to this table
with these three Grays surrounding him he said they all looked identical one
was staring down intently at him but the other stood a few feet away and this
cold Terror just swept over him as he says one was looking over his right
shoulder the other was looking over his left shoulder down at me but the one that was closest to me he was looking
down he turned his head to the right then he turned back at me and I got the
this sense that this creature could look at me in a way that was in such depth it
scared me to death and I started struggling I tried to get away but I couldn't break the Gaze the fear I felt
was like nothing I've ever felt in my life I mean this is the kind of fear that's inside your bones I was so scared
I kept struggling and struggling now at this point the dream shifted and Mike
found himself alone standing out in the desert near this abandoned ghost town
and at this point he would wake up and this same dream repeated itself over and over and each time Mike would wake up in
a cold sweat and after about two weeks of this he kind of sat down and meditate
on this and this is when the memory of the UFO sighting flooded back into his
mind he remembered everything including being apparently taken on board this
craft and as Mike says it was all right there I just couldn't believe it I still
can't believe it today it was so incredible when something as dramatic as that happens to you it is something you
will never forget it was beyond amazing Mike does admit that nothing bad
happened to him it's just that the event was incredibly scary I'd like to play for you a brief audio segment of my
interview with him where he describes a little bit of this onboard experience and these Grays this audio tape is not
of great quality so it's only 2 minutes long but it's very interesting to hear
from the witness himself so I'd like to play just a two minute segment uh I was laying down on
something and there was these three Pure White
beings at the foot of where I was laying and there was one that was
directly at the bo of this thing I was laying on and he was bent
over and his face was right in my
face and uh he looked like uh like a typical
gray guys you see but different um just behind him were two
guys looked exactly like him and one was looking over his right shoulder the
other was looking over his left shoulder looking down at me but the one that was
closest to me he turned his head for a second uh let me see he was looking down
he turned his head to the right and as he did that the outside corner of his
eye went all the way around to the very back of his head and finished off in a
point and it was in a wavy par like a sign W and it it went all the way in I
said wow man but then he turned back at
me and I got the sense that this
creature could look look at me in a way that was in such depth it scared me to
death and I and I started struggling I tried to get away but I couldn't break the Gaze that he
was gazing at me and the fear I felt was nothing like I've ever felt in my entire
life I mean this is a kind of fear that is inside your
bones I mean I was so scared it wasn't even funny and I kept struggling and
struggling as you can see and as I'm sure you can imagine that was a very profound experience for Mike really
quite scary for him but it changed everything for him he like many
witnesses told me it was like being woken up like before the encounter you
were living robotically in delusion in a haze with an ignorance uh this
absolutely changed his awareness increased his awareness by
Leaps and Bounds and in fact the aftermath of this encounter is almost as
interesting as the encounter itself because he started having psychic experiences that were off the charts so
that is the next thing I'd like to talk about is the aftermath often the aftermath of a person's encounter is
just as incredible as the encounter itself as you might imagine this encounter affected Mike profoundly and
in ways he never expected nor could fully comprehend but as he says it was
an experience that has opened my eyes and freed my mind to see and understand
so much more I never realized how deep in a fog we all are it's like a thick
blanket but now I know so ultimately this was a really good after effect it
woke him up to a whole new reality and there were other very weird after
effects in terms of how he began to think mentally as he says it's pretty amazing
I couldn't believe what new ideas about reality this opened up for me I started
to develop a desire to get into Electronics I began to take apart my ham radio my CB radios and putting new
channels in them realigning them making them work a lot better I started buying
Old Tube radios from thrift shops taking everything out and rebuilding these
radios I got into computer chips I would buy small computer chips from Radio
Shack bring them home hook them up and play with them I ended up buying a computer and I would interface these
computer chips with the computer I had no experience with this stuff before but my desire to do it was really strong I
even built a laser listening device of all things I built a transmitter out of one tube and that was it I had no
experience with this and yet I was doing this stuff so this is a after effect
that some contactees do describe a sudden interest in building Electronics
or an interest in astrophysics or mathematics and this is certainly true in Mike's case Mike does connect his
interest in electronics to his encounter but this wasn't the only strange thing
even more interesting is he began to manifest very powerful psychic abilities that in fact were so strong they
frightened him as Mike says I could sense people in a way that I never could
before I could look at them and actually see who they are how the hell do I put
this I could see their character no matter what face they presented to me I could see how they really are and it
went even deeper than that Mike found that with a proper focus and intention he could actually influence people's
behavior almost as though he was telepathically entering their minds this
shocked him he couldn't believe it so he began to test it and to his surprise it
worked he says tested it and repeated this hundreds of times as he says just
to make sure I wasn't fooling myself but apparently he wasn't so whatever
happened to him on board the craft he feels like it left him with this incredible ability to influence people
mentally and it was so powerful and so effective that Mike decided to completely abandon it as he says I don't
like the idea of being able to do that it's not right and I haven't done it since
he did continue to work with electronics he continued to explore the UFO subject
but he did keep his UFO experience completely private kept it secret for
years finally he did share it with a few friends but even then he felt uncomfortable about it as he says I felt
that I shouldn't tell the story like maybe I was betraying somebody like
maybe it's a secret and I shouldn't tell anyone but as the years passed this feeling became less finally Mike did
decide to report his case to muon once he even called a radio show and spoke publicly about his sighting leaving out
any mention of the grades or his dreams of being taken on board and he just went
on with his life he met a girl got married later divorced he worked a variety of jobs he eventually became the
head of a maintenance of a large 120 unit apartment complex he moved back he
moved away away from Oregon back to his original home in Norman
Oklahoma and his encounters weren't over yet in 1999 he was taking a lunch break
when he saw what looked like an 8ot wide metallic sphere moving very fast in
front of him at just above Treetop level slightly off in the distance he said it
was copper colored with yellowish bronze tints almost had a weathered dirty
appearance so he had someone with him and shouted out to his coworker his
friend look and his friend replied wow what is that that must be something NASA has
which caused Mike to burst into laughter and he said man NASA does not have stuff like that according to Mike this object
was moving far too quickly to be a balloon was totally silent was rising up and down following the line of the
terrain in the foliage always keeping keep being an even amount of distance
below wherever it passed it was only in view for a few seconds but it was long enough for Mike to get a pretty good
look at it and as he says I got the feeling that maybe they meaning the ETS
were checking up on me or something but it was weird that was his final
experience after retiring Mike pursued his passion as an artist he made the
drawings of the ETS and three-dimensional representations of the strange craft he had seen he's still
searching for answers he's now approaching his 80s but as he says
because of what happened I have never stopped trying to see if anyone else has
had this happen so those are Mike's experiences and as you can see they are
amazing his lifelong contact story is again in some ways pretty typical but in
some ways unique come to learn that yes there are amazing commonalities
between cases these are commonalities that I think corroborate people's accounts to a degree that pretty much
excludes any possible explanations of hoaxes hallucinations misperceptions or
mental illness there's just no way people can be describing these same exact details unless these events are
actually happening but again there's also these unique elements each person who has contact does have unique
experiences in some ways contact is unique as the individual so I think each
contact story does have something to teach us each one adds to our knowledge of what's going on here and Mike's story
is I think an important contribution to our understanding of this field again
his story is told in my book humanoids and high strangeness it's in quite a bit
more detail again he did allow me to use his phone name so I hope you do get a
chance to check it out because there were some parts of his story that I kind of had to censor out uh because it's
very graphic and I go into much more explicit detail in the book than I was
able to do in this video but either way I hope you've enjoyed this episode I love doing this
research I think this subject is endlessly fascinating I think it's crucially important to all Humanity we
all deserve to know the truth I think at some point we are going to have disclosure don't think our governments
are going to willingly do it I don't think they'll ever be truthful and transparent certainly not voluntarily
but I think again and I've said this before disclosure is inevitable for one simple reason because UFOs are real
because people have been visited by extraterrestrials and you can ignore the truth you can distort it you can lie
about it you can ignore it but you can never destroy it truth is truth and
truth will survive and I also think it's inevitable that one day and this could be decades from now who knows when but
Humanity will grow up and we will have open official contact with
ETS uh who knows how this will occur could be an existential event of some
kind uh we will see but I think our future proves to be very interesting no matter matter what happens so until then
thank you for watching I truly appreciate it it's because of you guys I do this research and I'm putting out
these episodes so thank you thank you thank you and until next time keep asking those hard questions it's up to
you keep searching for the truth I think all of us have an obligation to travel
down that pathway towards wisdom and spiritual enlightenment but most important of all keep having fun I will
see you next episode goodbye for now
