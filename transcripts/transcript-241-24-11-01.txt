THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE: SIX SHOCKING CASES
Nov 1, 2024

Summary:
Nov 1, 2024
It has been called the ultimate UFO encounter, the closest of all encounters: an onboard UFO experience. There are thousands of well-documented cases, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. These cases of direct contact with ETs involve extensive interactions and contain more information about the extraterrestrials than any other kind of encounter. Here are six shocking cases from across the world: Australia, Canada, France and three from the United States. The UFO phenomenon is so much more than just simple sightings of unexplained lights in the sky. It’s about meeting people from other worlds.

“I WAS IN A UFO.” In 1972, “Steve” (age 24) was staying in a cabin in the wilderness of Cariboo, British Columbia, Canada. One summer day, he stepped outside and was amazed to see two silver discs fly at treetop level a few hundred feet away. He somehow knew they were going to land and that he had to go meet them. He asked his girlfriend to join him, but she strangely refused. Steve went alone and came upon the two craft, landed on the ground. One had an open door and a ramp leading to the ground. Curious, Steve approached and entered. Inside he saw two short humanoids with gray wrinkled skin, wearing white doctors’ smocks. Afraid, he was about to run when one spoke telepathically in perfect English, “It’s okay, come on in.” So began an extensive onboard experience that Steve would keep secret for most of his life.

TAKEN IN TARBORO. James Howard (age 15) and his friend Brian Hollis (age 14) had been seeing odd lights near their homes in Tarboro, NC for a few weeks. Then, on the night of November 12, 1976, they saw a metallic, disc-shaped craft with colored lights land in the forest nearby. Going to investigate, they became frightened when a glowing, white-suited humanoid figure appeared. When they arrived home, more than an hour had passed. James began having nightmares of being onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled that both he and Brian were floated up into the craft, separated and given medical exams.

YURANI. It was a warm night in July 1981 as “Robert” (age 16) played frisbee with his dog outside his home in Seattle, Washington. Suddenly, clouds rolled in and Robert saw colored lights overhead. He now found himself unable to move as a warm beam of light pulled him up into the craft. He recalled seeing a being with cat-like eyes, then woke up the next morning in bed. Years later, he recalled a long onboard experience where he was met by a hybrid human-gray who introduced herself as Yurani. She told him that she was more than 200 years old, and began to impart a lot of information about why the ETs were visiting Earth. At one point, Robert was taken to their home planet.

SEVEN HOURS ONBOARD AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT. Eduardo Pons Prades was a famous political author in Spain when, on the night of August 31, 1981, his life changed forever. He was driving through the Pyrenees in France when he became weirdly lost and his car mysteriously stalled. Walking down a narrow country road, he came upon a large craft landed in a field. A door opened and a commanding voice spoke to him telepathically: “Don’t be afraid. Please approach…Come up to our ship. We wish to speak with you.” Unable to resist, Eduardo went onboard and was greeted by a group of beautiful human-looking people in white jumpsuits. They told him that they had contacted him because of his expertise in human violence, and that he needed to give the world a message.

“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.” One night in March 1982, an anonymous woman driving near Springfield, Missouri noticed a strange light at treetop level ahead of her car. At that moment, she seemed to lose control of the steering wheel and felt like her car was floating. The next thing she knew, she was parked next to a huge craft landed in field. She was drawn onboard and was greeted by six tall, strong, human-looking figures with blue eyes and blonde hair. They examined her and said that they were researching human reproduction. They said that they were her friends and would see her again.

“WHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR?” One night in 1986, three young men were camping in the wilderness outside of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia when they heard a strange noise overhead. Looking up, a brilliant light approached and descended, revealing itself to be a silver disc-shaped craft. Two little beings appeared underneath and approached the men, who found themselves now unable to move. All three men were floated up into the craft and subjected to a strange examination involving lights. The ETs were friendly and smiling as the witnesses were given a tour of the craft and soon saw something which left them speechless with wonder.

Six shocking onboard UFO encounters, each providing profound insights into the nature and origins of extraterrestrials, each providing answers about the ET agenda on our planet. We are not alone!

Nov 1, 2024
hello everyone my name is Preston dennet welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal today I'd like to talk about the ultimate UFO experience and that is
onboard encounters the title of today's episode is the onboard UFO experience
six shocking cases these are some really unusual and extensive cases I've chosen
Six coming from various locations across our planet including Springfield
Missouri Tarboro North Carolina Seattle Washington one in the French purines one
in calgari Australia and the last one in the
Caribou region of British Columbia Canada these are cases all involving
people who of of course have been taken on board a craft interacted directly with ETS face Toof face some involving
quite a bit of information and conversations so yeah the most extensive
of all encounters I mean when someone has an onboard experience there's really no chance of misperception this is not a
light in the sky this is far more than even a face tace encounter with humanoids in these kinds of cases people
are literally enveloped by what we call the UFO phenomenon and they these cases I think
have the most to teach us about what's going on on here that have certainly have the most information and I find
them the most fascinating as well and there are a lot of them according to the
rer poll of 1991 they did a survey and found that about one in 50 people show the markers
of being a UFO contacte so although we only have many thousands of cases that are fully
documented and on record it likely numbers in the millions so let's get started Ed and the
first case I want to talk about today I call I was in a
UFO this is a really interesting and extensive case which took place in 1972
in the Caribou region of British Columbia Canada I like this case for a
lot of reasons it is a single witness case it does have Landing traces and an apparent alien
artifact uh but it also has a lot of really extensive conversation
with the ETS interactions this case comes from Holly mclusky the director of the website ufob
BC and what a case this is the incident took place in 1972 at a remote cabin
this is located next to a little Lake in an old abandoned Sawmill somewhere in the wilderness of the Caribou region of
British Columbia Canada the witness is an anonymous gentleman we'll call him
Steve at the time of his his experience he was about 24 years old he and his
girlfriend were staying at a tiny Trapper cabin about 15 miles from the
nearest town it was a late Summer Afternoon when Steve stepped outside to
look at the scenery and immediately saw two dull gry saucer-shaped craft moving
slowly across the sky he estimates that each of them was about 30 feet across
totally silent and as Steve says in his own words I just stood there and watched them they
were heading for the lake I was watching the second one go by and it Zapped me I just felt it vibrating it started on my
right side went through my whole body really fast and then it came across the other side of my body as soon as they
did that to me then I knew that they were going to go Land by the lake and I knew that I had to go down there right
away so he rushed back into the cabin and immediately told his girlfriend to get up and come with to see the UFOs and
strangely she said no I don't want to usually she said yes to any Adventure
but despite asking her at least three times she still declined so frustrated
Steve left her at the cabin and walked briskly to the lake this was pretty
close less than 500 ft away and sure enough there were the two saucers sitting on the Hard Rock ground each
about 90 ft apart from each other he said the closer one had an open door
with a ramp leading to the ground so he walked right up to it he could now hear
a low rumbling sound coming from the craft and peering inside he did see a room in there so he walked up the ramp
and into the craft he found himself in a round room turned to the left and
immediately saw two quote space aliens staring right at him and as Steve says
their skin is really gray everywhere and it's really wrinkly their faces are wrinkly gray skin and two black eyes
they were about 4 feet high they were both wearing white smoks like a doctor would wear the smoks came down past
their knees halfway down to their calves they had long sleeves it looked like two
little men standing there so it was immediately apparent to Steve that these people were not from Earth he felt a
wave of shock and fear he looked back at the open door behind him and considered
making a run for it and this is one of the ETS spoke telepathically in clear
concise English saying it's okay come on in so he was shocked to hear them speak
English but they also seemed very friendly so he walked up to them he
could now see that they had only three fingers on each hand he says Their Eyes Were twice the size of humans all black
no visible ears just a hole tiny hole fir a mouth no visible lips a small flat
nose sort of pearshaped heads with no hair and looking around him he saw two
tables or beds each on a single Central pedestal there was a small 4ot long
counter the walls he said looked brownish curved up into the ceiling so the entire area looked totally spotless
he did see a doorway leading to a wedg shaped room otherwise the room was surprisingly empty so suddenly he
blanked out he lost Consciousness the next thing he knows he's feeling a sensation of pain and woke up to find
himself lying on one of the Tails Stark naked feeling really groggy and tired
one of the ETS immediately spoke to the other and said hurry up grab him he's waking up so the ET that was standing
next to Steve grabbed his arm while the other rushed to the counter Steve struggled at first but he was too groggy
to resist all he could do is really stare at the ET while the ET stared back at him very quickly the other little man
returned and Steve promptly lost Consciousness again the next thing he
knew he was standing up holding onto a railing of some kind still groggy still
unable to move one of the ETS stood behind him and Pur Steve massaged his
prostate while the other stood in front of him and obtained a sperm sample and again he lost consciousness
when he woke up he was now back on the table now fully clothed he was able to
move he got up started walking around the room and he started asking them questions he doesn't really remember
what the questions were he did see a picture on the wall on the far wall
which looked like it showed four planets he suspected one of them was Earth he couldn't be sure but he continued to
explore the room walked over to the other side where he saw another short counter two small stools again held up
by a single pedestal on this counter he did see a small flat television screen built flush
into the counter it had a small 6 in high joystick next to it three small
black buttons he had the impression it was the control panel for the ship and he knew better than to touch it looking
around he saw a hallway leading to another room strangely he says he felt no fear and in fact felt strangely
comfortable Blas he continued to walk around he looked down towards where he had come into the
craft and saw with surprise that the door was open and that it was now early morning just starting to get light was
clear to him that he had been inside this craft for the entire evening so at this point one of the ETS
walked up to him and said okay you can go now and feeling somewhat foolish for
asking Steve asked can you give me something so I can prove I was in here
and as Steve says the alien kind of looked at me for a sec then turned around and walked back to the medical
counter he came back and handed me something I put out my left hand and took it I think it was a metal slate
about 4 in by 6 in that's what I'm guessing I never really looked at it and
turned it over to see if it had writing or anything on it I turned and walked down the stairs along the ramp and
straight out of the UFO with this thing in my hand so he walked away from the craft
and turning around saw them both quickly rise up and fly away for some reason he
felt like they were still watching him and he took this metal object that they had given him and tossed it at a rotten
tree stump it fluttered to the ground he's not sure why he did this why he
didn't take it back to the cabin but then he walked back to the cabin his girlfriend was still asleep so he
crawled into bed and fell asleep and when he woke up he asked his girlfriend
how come you didn't come down to the lake last night to see the UFOs she looked at him blankly and didn't answer
and they never talked about it again as Steve says I don't know why I guess maybe we weren't supposed to talk about
it he did go back to the UFO landing site later that afternoon and saw a couple of tracks and indentations in the
ground where the craft had rested but as he says I never went back to look for
the thing I threw in the book Bush I don't know why I kind of turned my head to look but then I just kept walking
wasn't long after that maybe a couple of weeks we moved back into town eventually
we went our own separate ways though Steve never tried to retrieve the alien artifact and he kept his encounter
secret from everyone except once when someone he knew was talking about UFOs
he blurted out yeah I was in a UFO once but as Steve says they just looked at me
and continued with what they were talking about but Steve's sticking to his story many years later during an
interview in 2023 he said he was perfectly willing to take a lie detector test and he said
that the reason he had decided to come forward is because quote I'm 76 now and
my health isn't really good this is the first time anybody has heard this story I wanted to tell the story a few times
throughout my life but I didn't I thought well maybe somebody wants to hear it so now they have such a shame in
that case that the witness did not keep the alleged alien artifact that certainly would have brought this case
to a whole new level but it's still an interesting case yes it is one person's
testimony it's in essence purely anecdotal but the witness is so
obviously sincere and honest willing to take a lie detector test it's a really
poignant case and I just found it super fascinating because of how he interacted
with these ETS now let's move to another really amazing onboard encounter which took
place in Tarboro North Carolina in fact I call this one taken in Tarboro this
occurred on November 12 1976 it is a multiple witness case involving two
teenagers who initially did have missing time but we're able to recall what
happened and it's a fascinating case because they did have a very close up
sighting with this UFO and a humanoid and it turned out to be an onboard
experience makes me wonder how many cases where people see a UFO closeup don't realize that they had missing time
or simply suppress the memory of going on board I think it's probably a lot more common than we realize hard to say
for sure but I think you'll find this case quite compelling this next encounter reported by two teenage boys
was reported to muan and investigated by Dr Leo sprinkle PhD the two witnesses
are James Howard he was 15 years old at the time and his friend Brian Hollis age
14 it was about 6:15 on the evening of November 12
1976 as the two boys were walking near their homes in Tarboro North Carolina in
in fact for the past few weeks they had been seeing a strange light over the nearby golf course and River not far
from their homes as one of the boys says every night I'd strangely be drawn down
to watch that light so on November 12 events came to a
head when as one of the boys says we saw a disc with lights a disk-shaped dark
metallic object that had three separate lights fixed by equal distance
underneath we first observed the object After exiting my home the object was first sighted coming out of the East
then slowly descended into a large wooded area where we could see the lights between the trees the lights were
observed shining inside the tree line we stood out in a vacant field watching
this yellow to White glow when we then noticed smaller twinkling white lights
zigzagging in and outside of the tree line when the object came overhead
it was about 500 ft to 750 ft above the ground a glow of red green and white
lights underneath highlighted the outline of the object and it appeared to land in the
woods so this object had landed only about 1,000 ft away from one of their
homes and frightened both boys decided to run back home and as they did so they
saw something very strange as one of them says we observed a strange person
floating near the creek so this figure came floating Out of the Woods only about 450 ft away they could see
instantly that this was not a normal person it was very tall maybe as tall as 9 ft it appeared to be wearing a milky
white suit a jumpsuit of some kind it had a diamond shaped red helmet the head
underneath the helmet looked blackish gray it seemed to have short legs no visible feet the arms were of normal
length and became dark below the elbows they watched this for a good amount of
time about 15 minutes and during this time they said that it was weird cuz
everything seemed to be moving in slow motion and in perfect silence at one
point this figure stopped seemed to look directly at the boys then floated towards a billboard and disappeared
behind it so the boys ran home and told their parents and arriving home they saw
that it was now 7 30 an hour later than it should have been and following this
incident one of the boys James began to suffer from nightmares and sleepwalking and after this continued
for a few months they finally contacted muon and were put in touch with Dr Leo
sprinkle he suggested regressive hypnosis James agreed and actually went
to the University of North Carolina and had three sessions over a twomon period
sessions which of course revealed that both he and Brian were in fact taken on
board under hypnosis James recalled that after they had seen this disc land then
the smaller lights darting around they had gone to investigate them and both boys were suddenly rendered paralyzed
unable to move as two or more beings approached them they were described as
about 5T tall wearing milky white close-fitting jumpsuits black gloves up
to the elbows black knee length boots metallic red diamond shaped helmet which
fits snuggly over their heads he said their faces were Ashen gray they had a
very small nose a small slit for a mouth large dark almond-shaped eyes and bald
heads very much the typical Grays so often reported James says that both of the
boys were levitated above the ground and floated into a small clearing about 300
ft Into the Woods and resting on the ground in this clearing was a saucer-shaped craft about
15 ft High 75 ft wide pretty big it had a metallic gray surface and a thick
middle Rim around the perimeter so as they approached James
saw a doorway open up about 3 feet wide 6 feet tall you could see a yellow white
light coming out of it and both of them were brought on board and separated each
going down a brightly lit Corridor James says he was brought into a dark room and
placed on a short table another figure entered the room and began to give James
an examination and question him now if James's memory gets a little hazy at
this point he's unable to remember the full examination or what the conversation was other then he did not
really enjoy it he felt it was a bit one-sided he also said something
interesting that the being never moved its mouth so this was apparently telepathic he said this being was
wearing a dark gray diver suit with no helmet and had an oversized bald
head so the next thing James knows he's back out in the field standing next to his friend Brian both Bo are frightened
and run back to the house and it was then that they saw this floating humanoid being as they prepared to cross
the road back to their house so at this point neither of them had any conscious memory of having been on
board now after James's hypnosis session his nightmares did go away he stopped
having anxiety about the incident so that was definitely helpful and here's a
really interesting afternote because 5 years later in 1981 when James turned 21
he enlisted in the Air Force and to his surprise he was assigned the job
specialty of Target intelligence 2011 X1
which required him to work with top secret projects and information at Canon
air force base in Colorado now even more surprising the
defense intelligence agency he says sent a field agent to him to interview him
about this childhood UFO incident they actually required him to draw the craft
and the beam that he had seen which he did and he says that following this
interview his top secret clearance was in fact approved truly fascinating case
especially that little aftermath there where the witness joins the Navy and they basically force him to testify and
do drawings about his encounter before he gets his top secret clearance which
they gave to him anyway so that just goes to show once again that our
government's do know all about the subject and are not being truthful or transparent but we know this disclosure
yeah we're seeing bits of it happen but I'm not sure they'll ever be fully
truthful or transparent certainly not voluntarily or willingly we will see our
future promises to be quite interesting either way now let's move to another
amazing case this is one of my favorite in this bunch I actually like all of them in this compilation these these
onboard experiences are so fascinating but this case is particularly interesting because the witness did
remember his encounter without the aid of hypnosis that's always a plus I think
because although hypnosis I think works if done correctly it is nevertheless
controversial so I call this one urani and that actually is the name of the ET
given to the witness that alone I think makes this case pretty fascinating because we don't have a lot of cases
where ETS actually give their names there are quite a few of them but not as common as you might
think this one took place in July of 1981 in Seattle Washington and again it
is a single witness case but boy this guy was able to interact with the ETS
and have long conversations apparently taken to their Planet so it's an incredibly extensive
and interesting in case this next case comes from researcher David W Chase and
was published in his amazing book a visual guide to alien beings he's quite an accomplished artist this case
occurred in Seattle Washington in July of 1981 to a Anonymous young man I will
call him Robert at the time he was 16 years old was a warm evening and Robert
was out playing frisbee with his dog his mom mom was in the house and had turned
off her bedroom light and gone to bed the front door was still open to air out the house the night was dark and
cloudless but suddenly clouds began to quickly roll in it looked to Robert like
a storm was coming in pretty quickly the dog ran inside and David was right
behind the dog running inside when suddenly he found himself paralyzed unable to move the clouds had moved in
overhead by this point and he could see a bright light in them it began flashing
red and blue and he heard a sound which he said was kind of like a cricket without warning he found that he was
being struck by a beam of light coming from above he could feel the heat from it and he suddenly found himself Rising
above his home and he could actually see the bright City Lights of Seattle all
around him below the next thing he knew he was inside a craft it was very dark and
shadowy and there was an entity with cat-like eyes staring at him he felt a
wave of fear next thing he knows he's waking up in bed his clothes and shoes
are still on he's tired he feels unwell in fact he became sick enough that he
went to the hospital where he remained for 3 days now for many years this was
all he recalled but some years later he spontaneously recalled what happened
during this missing time in the 1990 5 interview with David Chase Robert said
that after being pulled up this beam of light he saw the bottom of the craft which looked like black metal it had
green white blue and red strobe like lights circling the edge three round
circular blue white yellowish lights which he believed was the power source
said that the beam of light that lifted him up into the ship came from the center bottom of the craft and once
inside this craft he was immediately greeted by a half human half gray alien being
who introduced herself as urani now she was pretty tall about 5' 7
in Slender somewhat frail looking and had Asian looking facial features Robert
described her pretty vividly and in detail he said her skin was pale white
with some hints of pink gray she had a large face which looked almost swollen
like a person with the MS a long thin neck large cat-like eyes with dark gray
irises no eyelashes prominent cheekbones a high forehead no hair small flat nose
small lips no visible ears her skin was very very smooth with no visible pores
he saw only two or three visible wrinkles on her forehead he said her hands were long three thin fingers and a
thumb no fingernails her shoulders were pretty broad her arms were very long reaching
almost down to the knees and she had long narrow feet she was wearing a pale
gray white tight fitting robe which did show her feminine figure it had long
narrow F length sleeves she wore dark black ankle length boots that looked
like they were made of some kind of cloth he did see later that these beings had four toes with no little toe but
this being urani was wearing a necklace was of sort of a black string and it had
a threein wide gold pendant on the end and on this pendant there was a black
z-like symbol engraved on its surface and he actually asked about it and she
answered she told him that it represented the name of their race and she gave the name it was
zodian now per Robert this being looked more Human Than gray perhaps a hybrid he
said that she looked human enough that if she were to wear sunglasses and a hat she could pass as human looking around
he saw dozens of other beings like her they moved around this craft by gliding
across the floor not walking he did see a few other humans who had also apparently been picked up by the
ETS he said the air in the ship was cold stuffy and moist smelled like a cross
between a locker room and a refrigerator now urani then proceeded to
give David an examination he was glided across the floor like the other figures
and he found that urani was easily able to override his willpower and put
thoughts into his mind or take them out she communicated with him telepathically
usually using images showed him various mental pictures of the future about his
personal life and world events such as the election of President Bill Clinton
which ended up coming true he said that they were able to speak verbally in a high-pitched voice but it did not sound
at all human now Robert thought that urani looked to be about 30 or 40 years
old but apparently reading his mind urani explained that no she was more
than 200 years old and explained that they don't age as quickly as humans do
she said that they are mostly vegetarians and that they eat a lot of brightly colored fruit and actually
demonstrated this for David she said that she worked mostly as a scientist
and a doctor and that they were here on Earth to observe humans and to repair
their own genetics she explained that long ago their Planet had become
overpopulated so that they were forced to limit their population growth and in the process of doing this
had messed around with their genetics and lost lost some of their capacity for
emotion no longer were able to love or laugh or cry or have the same strong
passions as humans and were not able to reproduce normally like we do she she
told him that they do live in peace but now recognizing the value of emotions
and realizing that their race is dying out they are studying human emotions and
learning how to breed and in exchange they are attemp ing to help humans to
become less aggressive so he was also given a tour of the craft he was shown
Laboratories sleeping quarters for the crew restrooms where he said contained a
device that could be pulled from the wall kind of reminded him of a vacuum cleaner he was then at one point
actually taken to their Planet which he said had a dim orange Sunset Sky all day
long he was shown some of their craft which looked long and cylindrical with
thrusters coming out from the bottom part of the craft he was shown that they
live in round likee buildings this was a long experience he estimates that it
lasted probably 3 days maybe even as long as a week but interestingly when he
was returned back to his room only a few hours had passed and of course he had
almost no memory of what had happened during all this missing time pretty unusual case for sure but these are
details we hear again and again in these onboard encounters it's such a shame
there's so much skepticism and disbelief and ridicule and confusion and fear surrounding the subject the cover up all
of this makes it very difficult for witnesses to come forward and share their stories and certainly most do not
want their names attached to it totally understandable but it would be a very different world if this subject was
treated differently and we're moving in the right direction don't think we're there yet now let's
move to another case where the witness did come forward did allow his name to be used he was actually a very
well-known author and went public with his story to Great consequence his story
ended up becoming very popular I call this one 7 hours on board an alien
spacecraft this occurred on August 31st 1981 in the French pyer
it's quite an extensive encounter it's sort of your basic contacte case whole
contacte era of the 1950s never ended it was sort of forced underground and
people stopped talking about it but the fact is people have been having these kinds of contact for a very long time
and still going on I mean these contact cases are far far more common than most
people realize there are a lot of cases involving human looking ETS and that's
what's going on in this really extensive and interesting and certainly controversial case the sole witness in
this case is a gentleman by the name of Eduardo Pon PR he was born in 1920 in
Spain and he actually became a highly influential author eventually writing more than 20 books on various subjects
such as the Holocaust the Spanish Civil War the dangers of fascism likely
inspired by his time in the Spanish military as a Young Man where he rose to the rank of sent so a good witness and
he was very well established in his career when on the evening of August 31st
1981 he was driving in France near the pra Mo LA preste area in the pines and
he became lost finding himself on a forested country road
suddenly his car stalled for no apparent reason and unable to get it started
Eduardo decided to hike down the dirt road and see if he could find assistance so as he's walking along he
sees a light in the distance ahead of him and he at first assumed it was a house walked towards it only to find
that it was in fact a large disc-shaped craft about 75 M wide which is almost
250 ft it sat on four Landing legs in a field was brilliantly lit with colored
lights really beautiful he said and although they were very bright strangely
they did not bother his vision which is normally quite sensitive to lights so
that puzzled him totally amazed by this sight he suddenly Heard a Voice saying
in a kind of sing song tone Don't Be Afraid please approach it felt almost
like a command and he obeyed he walked up to this craft a door opened a ladder
kind of ramp came down this voice repeated Don't Be Afraid come up to our
ship we wish to speak with you so he climbed up and into this object he was
immediately dazzled by a brilliant white light after his eyes adjusted he saw
three figures which he eventually saw were Asian in appearance wearing tight
fitt white jumpsuits and white boots he couldn't see their faces at first but
eventually did he did see that their clothes had no seams not so much as a
wrinkle his attention was drawn to a strange emblem on their chests and
seeing this the ETS explained that the design showed a drop of water a type of
wings and a Center eye then the kind of prism which they said represented
life now the room inside this craft was immense he said there was an oval table
in the center and chairs all around everything was spotless white he did see
a control panel with several screens on it all these beings were sitting at this table he said it was perfectly silent as
they placed a helmet on his head and began to communicate with him shortly
the craft did take off and at this point the UFO occupants held a long
conversation with Ard they told him that they were what we call
extraterrestrials that they had devoted their lives to searching the universe for other forms of intelligent life and
they asked him would you be willing to take a message from us destined for the inhabitants of Earth and as Eduardo says
I answered affirmatively without thinking twice so at this point Eduardo wanted to
go to his car to get a pen and paper to record all this but they told him that that would not be necessary that he
would remember everything word for word he says they spoke to him in perfect
Flawless Spanish but did explain that they were using a translator and he had
the feeling that they could read his mind so he peppered them with questions
he asked them where they came from they said they came from different planets actually named some of them they said
that they had visited many planets beyond Earth they spoke spoke to him extensively about many subjects such as
War education the family unit morals they said that their society Works in a
Cooperative without governments or money that everyone is educated from a very
young age everyone works peacefully with each other and all are considered equal
all are considered family or friends to each other they told them that they do not have any bases on Earth though they
do land their ships in unpopulated areas and will remain for months at a time
mostly observing and conducting scientific studies he said they do reach
out and contact people but generally do not intervene in human Affairs but on
rare occasions they have they told him that they have rescued groups of people from various natural
disasters they explained that they are a very peaceful people they told him that
there are countless inhabited planets Across the Universe they told him that they exercise great care never to
destroy the environment of these planets or any place they visit he asked about their jumpsuits at one point and they
explained that they wore them for protection against contaminants they gave him a tour of the
craft showed him samples of various minerals and rocks that they had taken
but they did explain that they do not take resources from Earth as they have all the resources they need from their
own Planet which they said has far more diverse Wildlife than our own they did
show him movies of some of the explorations that they have done at one point they gave him a juice to drink
which he said was sort of a fruit juice food tablets to eat which they said was
concentrated food they told him that they have overcome war and most diseases
they told him that Earth however is quite barbaric and explained that he was
specifically contacted because of his knowledge about the war and aggression
that is going on in our planet Eduardo asked them and I quote have you
encountered other warlike and armed planets like the Earth whose leaders did not want to establish contact with your
civilizations Eduardo asked him specifically have you encountered other warlike and armed planets like the Earth
whose leaders did not want to establish contact with your civilizations and they answered yes it
has occurred at times but never with such a dangerous Armament as your Earth
possesses Eduardo then asked and when when that has occurred what course of
action have you established the ETS told him that in such cases they withdraw their contacts
and limit their interactions but do keep a close eye on the planet and the
population the main message from the ETS was that Humanity was far too warlike
and that we must quote change it or it would not end well for Earth they told
him that open official contact with ETS would never occur until worldwide peace
was established on Earth so there was a lot more said but after the contact Eduardo returned to
his car continued his trip to Barcelona he immediately wrote down his experience
when he got there and was astonished to find that he was like the ET said able
to remember everything that took place during the encounter word for word down to the minis detail he says he also had
later telepathic contact with the ETS and he decided to write a book about it
which he did a Spanish language book which is titled a message from other
worlds now his editor and publish were not happy about this they warned him that this would likely ruin his
reputation marked the end of his career however Eduardo insisted that his story
was true that it was important that people needed to know that we are not alone in this universe and he wanted to
go ahead with the publication which he did and the book did very well though
was quite controversial there were some who accused him of hoaxing though Eduardo
never retracted his story he insisted it was true until the day he died so that's
a case that yeah has some controversial and unusual elements I was able to read
the book that the gentleman wrote about this case it is a Spanish language book
which I translated through Google so it wasn't perfect but such a fascinating
case with so much information it's pretty rare that people have these extensive conversations with ETS or
certainly we don't often hear about it but the details in his account certainly
match up with so many others I've heard I think it's legit it's a fascinating
case and as I said he stuck to his story to the day he died saying that this did
in fact really happen to him all right let's move to another one
I call this next case we are your friends this occurred in March of 1982
in Springfield Missouri of all the cases in this compilation this one is the most
brief we don't have a whole lot of information about it but I found it fascinating nevertheless because some of
the details in this are very commonly reported and I also found it interesting
that although this was a somewhat frightening experience for the witness she ultimately decided that it was
benevolent this next case is quite short it's from Linda Molton how and involves an anonymous woman who on one evening in
March of 1982 was driving near Springfield Missouri when she says she suddenly lost control
of the steering of her car and looking ahead of her she saw a light hovering at
Treetop level and she felt as if her vehicle was being pulled by an unknown
Force towards this strange light immediately a weird silence s settled
over her she says the sound of her engine stopped she could no longer feel
the bumps in the road and in fact it felt like the car was floating the next
thing she knew she was in a clearing surrounded by Forest a silver disc
shaped craft was on the ground resting on three Landing legs a light was shining down on the ground from
underneath it and a set of steps came out on the side leading down to the
ground the witness felt herself being drawn up into the craft she says she was
led through several small rooms to a larger room where there was a platform
or a table of some kind in the center she says it looked like white silver
Chrome but it was padded in a way that it weirdly molded to her body and she
knew for some reason that she was to lie down on the table which she did suddenly
she saw about six totally human looking figures surrounding her they were each
about 6 feet 2 in tall had very strong muscular bodies long blonde hair
high cheekbones and blue eyes she says they wore tight fitting Brown jumpsuits
shoes and a belt around the waist all the same color on the chest of the jumpsuit she did see an emblem a circle
with the head of a hawk or an eagle and wings on either side now per the witness
these figures were very friendly Pleasant caring and in fact told her we
are your friends they explained that they needed to do some tests on her but
that they would not hurt her the witness say she did feel a slight stinging in the breast area at one point she felt
like they did some kind of injection on either side of her armpit area but the
ETS told her that they wanted to see how Earth women feed their babies how they are shaped all this communication was
done telepathically and the witness did have the strong impression that they could read her thoughts afterwards they helped
her off the table and they said basically that they just needed to examine her they told her that he might
see them again sometime in the future they then led her to the exit she walked
to the door down the steps and outside the craft next thing she knows she's back in her car and turning to see where
she had been she saw the door Clos in this craft the legs retracted inside of
it and it took off with a whining whistling sound zoomed vertically off the ground and was gone and that was it
yeah pretty Brief Encounter but certainly fascinating can only imagine
what that must be like to have this sort of experience it certainly would change
the way you think about everything it's frustrating because I would love to talk to that witness I'm
sure there's a lot more details I really doubt that this was a oneoff I suspect
that there are quite a few other encounters that this person has had because that's the pattern we usually
see in these cases now let's move to the next case and the final one in this
compilation which I call what do you want us for that is a direct quote from
one of the witnesses who would ask that of the ETS this is an interesting case
because it's involves three Witnesses all of who were taken on board at the same time it's ultimately a pretty
friendly encounter for them they decided though initially it was quite frightening and super extensive because
they were given a tour of the craft got some really interesting information and it's just a little bit
different than a lot of encounters that you hear about this one occurred in 1986
in calori West Australia and I think you'll find it quite compelling this fascinating and
very extensive case multiple witness case comes originally from researcher Don Boyd and was was printed in his
magazine the psychic Australian but was then retold by Rex and Heather Gilroy in
their book the energy beings ET abductions from Beyond time it's a rare
case involving three men who were taken on board UFO together in fact we know
the names of these Witnesses Alan gosland Shan Brooke and Mike Dubin they
were camping in the scrubland outside of Calgary Calgary is the location of a
huge open pit mine this is a small town in Western Australia it also contains
the beautiful natural area of the Carl Kura National Park the men were just
sitting around a campfire looking at a clear Starry Night Sky when they heard this weird loud humming noise so they
got up to investigate the source and in a clearing saw a bright silvery glow
coming from overhead right in front of them in fact it was so bright they had to Shield their eyes and as it faded
they saw that it was in fact a large round silver dome-shaped craft hovering
just above the ground immediately two small humanoids materialized standing on
the ground just below the craft they were about 1 m 3 feet tall had light
brown skin but were pretty much human looking though with large faces large
dark eyes a low thick brown Ridge pointed ears
they were wearing what looked like plastic skintight jumpsuits and white boots each of them carried a small metal
wand in one of their hands and they were not that far away they stood about 9 M
away from the witnesses less than 30 ft so Shawn whispered to his friend said we
better make a run for it and although all three of them agreed that this was was a good idea and wanted to do it all
three found themselves quote Frozen to the spot as these beings were pointing
their little wands at them this point these beings approached began to poke
and prod the three frightened men who were still unable to move or even speak the craft now moved silently until
it was directly overhead a glowing opening appeared in the bottom of the craft and all three men they said were
Le ated up through this door which shut and then lowered these men back to the
floor of the craft they could now see that they were in a circular room with all kinds of weird looking alien
equipment some they said looked metallic others looked almost rubbery they did
see what looked like computer-like television screens both large and small on the walls Mike yelled out to the
beings what do you want us for there was no response however
two more ETS identical to the first two entered the room looking out at one of
the screens the witnesses could see the landscape below them receding so it was clear to them that the craft was now
flying away from the original location which caused them all to become even more afraid than they already were but
events took a surprising turn when the ETS ushered the three men into a clear tube this also frightened them but to
their surprise it turned out to be an elevator type device which lifted them up to the top Dome of the craft and
there they saw two more of these same beings these beings were Seated on stools sitting before what appeared to
be some kind of control panel and one of these beings turns looks at the
witnesses and smiles and without saying anything motioned for them to sit down
now they observed a large screen which now showed that this craft was somewhere out in deep space the lights inside this
craft dimmed which allowed them all to see outside through oval windows that were encircling the Dome now these two
little ETS were both smiling and they began to talk among themselves with this
unintelligible but kind of melodious muttering sounds and all three of the
witnesses began to slowly relax and their fear faded away because it was
clear the ETS were not trying to hurt them after some time the Witnesses were
guided back to the elevator and brought to a lower section of the craft and for
a moment were left unattended inside this room it was just them they did see
a few closed doors and unrecognizable equipment on the walls and ceiling
suddenly they were in there only a few moments when without warning lights
began to flash from the walls and the ceiling some of them making weird woring
noises and all the witnesses had the impression that these were recording devices of some kind and they were being
x-rayed or having pictures taken of them or recorded in some way then the door
opened the ETS still smiling still silent motioned them through the door
into another room and placed them in front of a tall kind of Wide glass-like
Window which suddenly flashed with yellow light and again the men felt that they were being recorded or x-rayed or
scanned in some way then they were left alone again and after being in there alone for some time
the men started to become curious cuz they could see a closed door with a small sort of gold plastic looking
button about one meter above the floor so they pressed it and found that it opened the door they went into another
room and were shocked to see various animals whole tree goats and sheep all
in special pens in another they found a bow with two cows in the third room they
found some dogs Kangaroos and other animals native to the area all in
special pens so they were looking at all this in complete surprise when suddenly the ETS came into the room ushered them
into still another room with a sort of soft glowing orange light the ETS left
closed the door on the men again leaving them alone at this point the orange
light in the room faded and the men were left in total darkness they then smelled a strange odor and
they all blacked out the next thing they knew they were waking up in a standing
position dazed in the exact location where they had been taken looking up
they saw this silver craft moving quickly off into the night sky and it disappeared in the
distance so the three Witnesses were shocked amazed all agreed that the
experience was very benevolent friendly that the ETS meant them no harm and apparently only wanted to study
them now they did find out that it was now just past 10 p.m. they estimated
that they had been on the craft for about 4 hours but it appeared that only
2 minutes had elapsed on Earth so that was another puzzling factor to this very
interesting experience so there you go a 4H hour long encounter in involving
three gentlemen and it's really interesting because they report coming back in only 2 minutes apparently had
passed on Earth but the encounter itself lasted 4 hours we see this in a number
of cases where ETS apparently pulling people out of the
time stream um hard to say exactly how they do this but it's certainly apparent
that they can do things that we are unable to do or even fully understand
because that does turn up in quite a few cases so there you go six cases
involving the ultimate encounter being taken on board a craft talking to
ETS getting all kinds of information from them as we see probably the most
common feature people do describe when they're taken on board is being physically examined but a lot more
happens it's kind of a misconception that that's what uh T contact is all
about being physically examined because that's simply not true contact happens
for many many reasons so yeah some really amazing cases a lot of
information I think these six cases alone provide a pretty good crosssection
of what it's like to be taken on board and answer a lot of the questions that we have about ET contact but again just
a tiny tiny portion of the actual number of cases it's so much more common than
people realize it's time we stop questioning whether this is actually
happening we know it's happening really we need to move our attention towards understanding ET contact and moving
forward with it it's a subject I think that will change the world as we know it
it's why I do this research it's a very important subject and we all deserve to know the truth that we are not alone in
this universe it's so obvious when you look at the stars at any rate thanks
again guys I truly appreciate you guys watching and tuning in every week thank
you so much and until next week keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth and most
important of all keep having fun and I will see you next Friday and here take a
look at this necklace it's cool huh there's a scorpion in Amber this is my
Halloween episode black shirt orange undershirt having a little fun see you
guys later bye
