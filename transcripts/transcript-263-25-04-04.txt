REALLY STRANGE UFO ENCOUNTERS: TWELVE TRUE CASES
Apr 4, 2025

Summary:
Apr 4, 2025
Each UFO case, whether a simple sighting or an onboard UFO encounter, adds to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and provides another piece to solving the UFO mystery. One of the most fascinating aspects of UFOs is that they behave in weird ways. This video presents 12 very strange encounters that show the high strangeness of ET contact. The cases come from all over the world and provide strong evidence of UFO reality.

“IT SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTED TO DO.” Aug 20, 1955 was a windy day as two men stood on the dock of Kenora Bay in Ontario, Canada. Suddenly, a saucer zoomed over the water, seeming to study the men. But then it moved to the nearby hospital, and seemed to inspect that, before suddenly darting away.

THE UFO THAT LISTENED. On Sep 3, 1955, Frank Flaig and his wife Ruth drove along Boomer Rd in Cincinnati, OH, when a small silver sphere descended to the ground. Frank stopped the car and went over to investigate. But his wife Ruth became concerned for his safety and called out to him. Amazingly, the UFO seemed to react to her voice and darted off.

THE THIRSTY UFO. In Jul 1965, John Hambling was working with another man in the wilderness north of Hazelton, Canada when they saw a UFO swoop down over a small alpine lake. The craft sent a cylinder down to the surface and began to suck up the water. They were able to take several photos before the craft darted off. Was it there for the water? Or was there another reason?

“WE WANT TO WATCH FLYING SAUCERS.” One night in Aug 1967, 12-year-old, Leif told his parents that he and his friends were camping in the front yard of their home in Duncan, Canada, to watch for flying saucers. His parents were amused. But later, Leif rushed to the window to announce that the UFOs had arrived. His parents rushed outside and saw the UFOs themselves.

UFO INSPECTS FARMHOUSE. On Feb 19, 1968, Martha Heggs was alone with her two children in her farmhouse in Bengough, Canada when she heard a piercing noise. Looking outside, she saw a flying saucer hovering over the power-pole. As her dog cowered in fear and the cows ran for safety, the saucer closely inspected each area of the farm. It was the strangest 20 minutes of Martha’s life.

UFO LANDS AT WASHINGTON DC. At 6am on Oct 24, 1968, a paperboy was making his rounds in Bethesda, Maryland when he saw a landed UFO in Fort Bayard Park, along the border of Washington DC. He watched it for about three minutes when it suddenly flew away, leaving a burnt circle of grass. The case would soon generate interest at high levels of govt.

PANIC AT THE POOL. In Oct of 1968, tourists were enjoying themselves in the pool at Sulphur Mountain Resort in Banff, Canada. Suddenly, a UFO appeared over nearby Mt Rundle and everyone stopped to watch. Then the UFO swooped down at high speed beside the pool, causing complete panic. Some people were injured and a few went into clinical shock.

SPEEDWAY DRIVER’S ORDEAL BY UFO. Early on Apr 13, 1971, racecar driver, Geoff Richards and his wife drove along a remote highway outside of Brunswick, West Australia when a UFO swooped down and buzzed their car. But then it returned and zoomed towards their car, playing a game of chicken, not once or twice but several times.

THE 15-TON CRAFT. One night in May 1971, Angela Rajh saw an odd glow near her home in Stara Cerkev, Yugoslavia. Going to investigate, she saw that the glow was a landed flying saucer. She raced home, only to learn that her mother saw the UFO. Also, her neighbors saw the craft on the ground and walked up to it. Later they found some very odd landing traces.

UFO BLOCKADE ON MPUSHINI BRIDGE. On the evening of July 22, 1972, two gentlemen were driving through Ashburton, South Africa when they came upon a UFO sitting in the middle of the road on the Mpushini Bridge. Unable to pass, they had no choice but to stop. The UFO took off a short time later and they called the police, who saw it too.

UFO TAKES OVER TRUCK. On Jul 18, 1976, the sheriff’s office near Gravel Switch, Kentucky was flooded with calls from people reporting UFOs. The UFO flew around for hours. One lady said it chased her car. But the strangest call came from two witnesses who said the UFO came down over their truck and took control of the vehicle.

MISSING TIME ON THE TOILET. On the night of Mar 13, 1979, Mr. WP went to visit the pub near his home in Alverthorpe, England. Strangely, however, he found himself taking the wrong route. Unexpectedly he came upon a UFO which chased him across the field. Suddenly he found himself standing in the public restroom next to the pub with no idea how he got there.

These twelve cases show how any encounter can provide profound insights into UFO behavior. Only by examining all the cases will we discover the alien agenda and the reasons for the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. And there is no shortage of cases! The truth is coming out. We are being visited.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal. I have got an interesting episode for you today. I call it Very
Strange. 12 encounters with extraterrestrial humanoids. I've got a
dozen cases reaching all the way back to 1940 up to 2013. So, some pretty early cases and
some recent ones, too. again coming from all over the world. I've got cases
from Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden,
Puerto Rico, Argentina, Canada, and four from the United States, including
Louisiana, Minnesota, Utah, and Washington. So, quite a wide variety of
locations. Also quite a wide variety of humanoids. Short little humanoids, very
tall ones, grays of course, humanl looking ETS. I'm really fascinated by
the wide variety of descriptions that people provide, but significantly they
are all almost exclusively humanoid in form. I think that's an important
detail. Has a lot to teach us. All of these cases have quite a bit to teach us
not only about what's out there in the universe beyond Earth but about
ourselves. So these cases, some are multiple witness, some are single
witness, some are quite short, a few are quite long, but each adds to our
understanding of extraterrestrial contact. I find the subject especially
fascinating. these humanoid encounters. I think they have so much we can learn
from. So, let's just get started. And the first case I'd like to talk about today, I call tall humanoids in glowing
metallic outfits. This one occurred in the 1940s in a very rural area of Oriente.
This is in Buenes Ares, Argentina. I like this case not only because it's a
very early case of a landed UFO and humanoids predating the modern age of
eupfology but also the witness is quite credible. He is a military officer. I
think that adds a level of credibility to the witness but also a multiple
witness case. Landing traces as well very unusual humanoids. There's a lot to
find interesting I think about this case. The primary witness in this case is a police sergeant by the name of Don
Vicente Pedon. He lived in Buenus Argentina at the time of his encounter.
It was in the 1940s while stationed in Oriente. This is in Argentina. He was
working with Corporal Elias Gatani when suddenly a young man who lived in the
area came running up to them one evening saying that he saw quote a plane fall in
flames in the countryside. So alarmed about what might be an air accident of some kind, Vicente
and Corporal Gatani and the young man who is known only by his initials, Mr.
NN all three rushed to the area where he had seen this craft come down. They
traveled by a police car to a fairly remote location near a mountain and
exiting the car they approached to within about 200 m of this location. And
immediately they noticed a strange luminous discshaped object sitting on
the ground. And standing around it, they saw several abnormally tall humanoid
figures which looked quite unusual because they were wearing glowing metallic looking outfits. They were also
moving with unusual slowness and were carrying what looked to the witnesses like some kind of jar in their hands. So
they were immediately alarmed by the strangeness of the site and they decided to get back into the car and drive away
to a safer distance. But to Vicente's surprise, the car would not start, and
repeated attempts failed to get the engine started. Although still concerned, they decided that at this
point, the best course of action would be to just remain in their vehicle and
observe the strange craft and the humanoids. As Vicente later told the
investigator, they quote, "Abandon themselves to the fate of events." Now
after several minutes they saw that the humanoids had apparently gone and the craft was now starting to move backwards
slowly and steadily. Vicente now tried again to start the car and after a few
attempts the engine started normally and they immediately left the area. The
craft was still in view as they drove off. Now the next day the original
witness who saw this craft come down, Mr. NN did return to the site and found
areas of burnt grass where the object had landed. Unfortunately, the police
sergeant Vicente Pedon did not go back to investigate the site, but years
later, to his credit, in 1971, he did report this event to UFO researchers. I
think you'll agree that case qualifies as very strange. It is a shame that the witnesses became so fearful that they
drove off and did not see this craft depart. This is a pattern we see in a number of cases. People get so afraid of
something that's clearly out of their experience beyond their world view. I
think this is what causes the fear. It's not the actual event itself. Because let's face it, nothing really happened
other than that they saw a landed UFO and humanoids. The interaction between
them was virtually non-existent, but certainly a strange and important
case. Now, let's move to the next case. This one also has some very interesting details. I call this one the clouded
craft. This occurred one day in October of 1952 at the Nemes Corbase airport in
France. Multiple witnesses in this case, very close view of a UFO and humanoids
and a really unusual craft as well. This case originally comes from French
researcher Jean Terasen and was widely published in various magazines and
apparently exaggerated to some degree, but was published in space messenger and
Uranos and in anatomy of a phenomenon by Jacqu Valet. Blackout
Surleoup Volant by Jimmy and in other publications. Not all of these
publications got the story right. So this was a little bit hard to figure out exactly what happened here, but the
witness is a brick layer, a stonemason by the name of Felix Fizz. And it was
around 7:00 p.m. one evening in early October that Felix was working at a
construction site with several other men near the Neem Corbsac airport. And
looking up, they all saw this kind of whitish cloud coming from the southwest direction from the direction of
Marseilles and moving rapidly towards them. In just a few moments, this quote
cloud, which was at very low altitude and quite small, seemed to accelerate
and came right alongside this group of workers who could now see that it was in fact a strange craft of some kind. They
said it was silvery yellow, about 90 ft long, 20 ft wide, and perhaps 2,000 ft
high or less. But the front end was surrounded by this cloudlike vapor which
is why it looked like a cloud when it was approaching them. And so was the rear end which was partially covered by
this cloud itself. Now on the front section leading to the midsection of
this craft there were three large windows which covered fully the top half
of this craft and they were brightly illuminated by a very white clear almost
fluorescent-like light. Most amazing was that through these windows, the
witnesses saw five or six men, or so it appeared, wearing large goggles, tight
fitting helmets, and what looked like cocky colored spaceacuits is how they described it. The witnesses could see
that the these figures inside the craft were moving around a little bit. So, these were live beings. The sketch seen
here was produced by the researcher Jeene Teras, but it was in the presence
of the witnesses who verified its accuracy. Very quickly, this craft moved
off and now again took on the appearance of a moving cloud roing at the aft
section. The entire duration of this observation was pretty short, about 15
seconds. This craft moved in a straight line, never deviating from its course.
As it passed overhead, they could hear a very soft purring of an engine, which
Felix compared to a powerful but very quiet American car. Now, the researcher
Jeene Terasen later discovered that witnesses in Marseilles actually saw
this object at 6:50 p.m., 10 minutes before Felix and his co-workers saw it,
which was at 7 pm. and witnesses at another city, Levier, saw it about 10
minutes later. This comprises a distance of about 250 km, 155 miles, which means
that this object was moving at about 750 km hour or over 460 mph. There were jets
that could fly this fast at that time, but the witnesses said that this was not a jet. There were no wings, no tail
section, no lights on it, just a solid cylinder with very large
windows. Now, here's where the story gets a little exaggerated because a few of the sources claim that the object was
actually seen on the ground, but as near as I can tell, this appears to be misreporting or
exaggeration. So, so interesting. To me, the most interesting aspect of this case is the fact that this UFO was obscured
by this cloudy mist as it approached the witnesses and as it left the witnesses
as well. So, you really couldn't see this craft until you were right alongside it. It's also strange because
it was it was at very low elevation. I wonder about this case. Could it
possibly be a case of involving a humanpiloted reverse engineered craft
using ET tech or some advanced technology within military hands? I
think it's a distinct possibility, but it's quite early for that. 1952 certainly possible, but I have
questions about that as well. I mean, why would there be such huge windows on this thing? Why would it fly directly
over the witnesses at such low elevation there? It's a really unusual case. And
yeah, the most unusual thing for me is the way this craft was obscured from view by these clouds in front of it and
behind it. Very strange. All right, let's move to the next case. I have some
similar questions about this one as well. This one I call a UFO driveby with
humanoids. This occurred in October 1957 in a very rural area of Alberg, Denmark.
I think the location of this encounter is significant because this is an
unusual location in terms of its geography as we'll see, but a multiple
witness case, very closeup observation, and I think you'll find it interesting.
This case was originally published in the magazine UFO Neat and also appears
on the website Hidden Denmark. This involves a brief but still very interesting close observation of a
UFO with humanoids inside. It was 11 p.m. one evening in October of 1957 as a
farmer and his wife drove south over the very remote store bog. This is known as the great
wild bog. It's located 20 miles northwest of the city of Alberg in
Jutland, Denmark. Now, at the time, this was one of the largest raised bogs in
all of Europe to a pretty unusual area geographically speaking. Currently, it's
been largely drained with only parts of it being preserved. But on that night in
question, suddenly this couple noticed a very bright shiny object, clearly a
craft of some kind coming directly towards them. It was at ground level or
just above it and was in a field about 50 m, 150 ft off to the side of the
road. It was moving very slowly, no more than 35 km per hour or under 20 mph.
But in moments, these two vehicles drove right by each other. And as they did,
the farmer and his wife could now see that it was indeed some kind of vehicle, and that in fact there were two
human-looking figures sitting inside it side by side. This craft was not large,
and it wasn't clear to the couple whether it was touching the ground or not, but certainly very close to it. And
it did have a large transparent dome encasing these two passengers. and the dome itself had a strange bluish green
glow. The farmer wanted to go closer to get a better look, but his wife warned
him against this. She was apparently concerned about the high strangeness of all of this, so he just kept driving
away, but he drove slowly and he watched this mysterious craft from the rear view
mirror as it disappeared to the north. The illustration you see here was done by Simon Hesseler Johansson who calls
this case quote one of my favorite obscure Danish cases. It is quite
unusual. The witnesses were not necessarily convinced that this craft was ET in origin, but hovercrafts were
not available publicly until 2 years later in 1959. So it does not appear to be that.
Although this was published in a UFO magazine and presented as an ET encounter, the possibility remains that
it was in fact human in origin. That's another one that makes me wonder, could this have possibly been humans piloting
an advanced craft of some kind? Perhaps a hovercraft. They were being invented
around that time, though officially they weren't released to the public at this
time. So, I don't know. It's strange. Would a hovercraft be going through this
large swampy area where there's really nothing out there? Whereas UFOs are
often seen hovering over what we call nature reserves, then that's certainly would
qualify in this case. And if this was human piloted, what's it doing driving
alongside the road right next to people? Uh, I don't know. can make up your own
minds about it. Uh the witnesses were reluctant to call these humanoids that they saw
extraterrestrial, but that's a pattern we see in quite a few of these cases. Generally speaking, people do not jump
to the UFO ET explanation. They want to look for something that's much more conventional, something much more
explainable, and only when they see all this high stranges do they realize, wow,
this is not so easily explained. So yeah, an important case. I like this
next one because this one was researched by a very careful and professional
researcher, quite prolific. This one is a single witness case, but the
description of what he saw is so unusual. I call this one, they looked like people, but they weren't. And this
one occurred on December 18, 1977 in the very rural town of Sahavara,
Sweden. And it's such an unusual case of the description of this craft and the
humanoids on top of it. This very interesting and unusual case comes from
prolific researcher and author Klaus Son and it appeared in his Swedish language
book, The UFO Mystery, From Flying Saucers to Circles in the Cornfield. The
only witness is Bruno Nygard. You can see him here. Was just before 900 PM on
December 18, 1977. And Bruno was walking along a dirt road towards his home located in the
very small village of Saha Vara in Sweden. And as Bruno says in his own
words, "I saw a dim light above the street lamps. The light descends towards
the ground but soon disappears. After a while, I saw something near the road
illuminated by the street lamp. It looks like a snuff box on edge with two people
sitting on it. So, you can see his drawing here. The object was the size of a small car, and the two figures sat
towards the rear. Here's the thing. They were under the open air. There was no
dome or windshield or any structure to cover them. The object was largely featureless except for a small square
located on the front end. The objects and the figures disappeared briefly, and
Bruno didn't think too much of it and kept walking. But after a few short moments later, this object again became
visible. And Bruno could now see that the two figures had gotten out of this strange craft and they were walking side
by side along the road while this strange craft hovered between them above
them traveling at the same pace. So this was quite odd. Still, Bruno assumed that
these must be two boys from the village. But it started to get closer and he
could see that it was quite strange. As Bruno says, they are getting closer to
me. At regular intervals, they bend down towards the ground as if they are picking something up, but there's only
snow and ice. 20 m from me, they stop just as they spotted me. Lightning fast,
they grabbed the edge of the object, bent their knees, and jumped in at the same time. I'm sure I was the one making
them do this. They looked just like people. They had heads and hands and
feet. When they jumped into the craft, they bent their knees. But they weren't
people. So Bruno now realized that he was seeing something very unusual. And
in confirmation of his realization, he now watched this object move quickly,
straight up, spin around, and move a few hundred meters to the east, disappearing
behind the trees. Another good example of a witness who was reluctant to say, "Oh, this is extraterrestrial." He kept
thinking, you know, could these be kid, you know, who is this? Could these be people from a nearby village? What's
going on here? But his description of the craft, this kind of floating platform, how unusual is that? There
aren't a whole lot of cases of people seeing ETs just standing out there on top of a craft in the open air, but
there are a few, and it's certainly an important addition to that category of
cases. So, yeah, like I said, each case provides another piece of the puzzle.
Each case has something to teach us about what's going on here. Now, let's move to the next case. This is my
favorite, I think, in this little collection. I call this one it was not
human. That is of course coming from the witnesses themselves. This is a multiple
witness case. I like that. It's always nice when you have more than one witness. That adds a level of
credibility to the case. This one occurred on August 7, 1979 in Duth,
Minnesota, where these two ladies were driving along a remote highway late at
night and had an encounter with humanoids. It's really interesting because this case actually took place
during a huge wave of sightings in the area. Almost all of which took place on
lonely highways late at night. UFOs and ETs seem to have a propensity for
showing up in that setting. But yeah, this case, it is so strange. This is
such an amazing case. It comes from Muon field investigator and Minnesota State
Section Director William I. McNeff and was published in the May 2005 issue of
the Muon UFO Journal. There are two witnesses known only by their first
names, Liz and her friend and coworker Ruth. The two of them had just left a
company bridal shower in Caribou Lake, Minnesota. was around 9:10 p.m. August
7, 1979, and they were heading west on Industrial Road
885 and had just reached the intersection of Munger Shaw Road, which
you can see here. And this is when they noticed some figures on the road ahead of them. About a half mile or a mile,
Liz brought the car to a stop. And as Liz says, we both noticed three figures
zigzagging over the center line straight ahead. Ruth said, "What in the world is
going on down there?" Liz replied, "It looks like three little ones on bikes,
but they'd better move cuz here I come." This point, Liz switched on her high
beam headlights and stepped on the gas. And as Liz says, they did not get off
the road. As we came upon them, one and then apparently the other just zoomed,
did not walk off to the left across the ditch. And as I switched to the low
beam, I had one dead center with the right front headlight. It had a huge
head, no hair, no ears, huge eyes set in deep hollows, wrinkles or folds, but no
protruding nose, and just a small slit for a mouth. So at this point, both of
the witnesses said out loud to each other, "My God, what is it? My God."
Repeatedly over and over again. The two creatures that had darted off the highway did not appear to run, they
said. The witnesses said that instead these figures were quote floating,
zigzagging, and zooming. So that was odd. But now there's this figure standing right in front of them, right
in front of their car, directly in the headlight. And as Liz says, they looked
so odd, almost a luminous gray. I could not see clothes. They had arms. I didn't
notice the fingers. The arms were in proportion to the rest of the body, but he had a huge head at least 18 to 20 in
across with huge eyes 2 and a half to 3 in. So with no choice to either stop or
run over this strange creature, Liz brought the car to a complete stop.
Immediately at this point, the dash lights on the car went out. Now, there were no street lights on this section of
the road, so the only illumination was their headlights. And I'll just let Liz
describe what happened next. As she says, "Our eyes were glued on the
colorless clayl looking creature with black eyes larger than a chicken egg.
Ruth was scrabbling to find the door lock in the dark with both of us babbling in fear. We knew we could not
hit the being, and the thought of backing up never occurred to us. So for
the next 8 to 10 minutes, these two frightened witnesses stared in absolute
amazement at this strange being. They had never heard of gray aliens or given
much thought to UFOs, so they really had no idea what they were looking at.
Finally, Liz tried to frighten the creature into moving off the road by putting the car into gear and moving the
wheels to the left. And as she says, this was all to no avail. All I could
think of was hopefully another car would come from either direction. No luck. So
finally Liz just turns to Ruth and said, "Maybe we should move very slowly ahead and try to clear it." Ruth replied,
"Yes, yes, let's get out of here." So Liz eased the car forward and as she
says, "We managed to bypass it." But in doing so, it naturally stood closer to
her side of the car. And when it got alongside of the right lower windshield, she couldn't stand it. She yelled and
quickly moved over almost on top of me. When I was sure we had it cleared, I
took off fast. And being so upset, I took a wrong turn down the old road in
total darkness. I knew immediately I had made a mistake. So still panicky, they
put the car in reverse and backed out onto the highway. The dashlights were still not working, but they could now
see a car drive by the area where they had just seen these strange creatures.
This car did not stop. So they continued their drive home all the time talking
quote furiously about what they had seen. They had no idea what it could be,
but they both decided it was not human. It was walking on two legs. was humanoid
in form, was definitely not an animal, nor was it someone wearing a mask or a
costume. Finally, they wondered if it might actually be quote an outer space
being. So, Liz dropped Ruth off at her house. Ruth immediately told her her
husband, who didn't believe her, and actually ridiculed her. So, by the time Liz reached her own house, her husband
had already gone to bed. Her niece was at the house and needed a ride home, a distance of only three miles. She asked
her husband to drive. She wanted to talk to him. He refused. He wanted to stay in bed. So Liz and her niece got back in
the car. And this is when Liz told her niece the whole experience, which as you
can imagine, frightened her niece a little bit. In fact, she was almost too afraid to run from the car to her
apartment just that short distance. But of course did it. Finally Liz returned
home the still the dashboard lights are not working. And as Liz says when I came
home to a quiet house I fell apart. I cried and begged my husband to wake up
and listen to me. I had to tell him and it couldn't wait until tomorrow as he requested. So he got up and after
hearing her story to his credit he believed her but had no explanation. His
response was, "Why didn't you hit it and throw it in the trunk and it could have been
analyzed?" Liz later did tell her children, and both she and Ruth told
their co-workers, who told them that they should report the incident to authorities, but afraid of being
disbelieved or worse, ridiculed, they elected to remain silent, at least for
the time being. Liz did record the event in detail in her diary. Following this
event, Ruth and Liz rarely discussed it, mainly because Ruth found it quite
frightening and just wanted to forget about it. As Liz says, it was the most
terrifying experience either one of us had gone through. Now, a final strange
detail was that Liz's husband is a professional car mechanic, and after
looking at the dashboard and trying to get it to work, he couldn't do it. So, they took it to another mechanic,
Johnson's Auto Electric, who specializes in the electrical system, and they
couldn't fix it either. This case would have gone unreported if not for the fact that Liz's cousin was a friend of the
researcher, William McN, and told him about the experience and vouched for
Liz's honesty. This is what led to an investigation. And as the investigator William McNeff writes, Ruth does not
want to think about the event and refused my request for an interview. Both women had responsible jobs. They
reported their experience in spite of perceived risks to their reputations to co-workers and relatives. The prime
witness must be rated high in credibility and inaccuracy of recollection. The beings she reported
must be considered to be definitely unidentified. The experience was the
apparent beginning of a wave of UFO reports that continued for the rest of 1979.
And boy, William McNeth is not kidding because in fact it was just 20 days
later on August 27 that the very famous incident happened to Val Johnson, a
police officer on a remote highway in Warren, Minnesota, when he actually had
an apparent collision with a UFO. This is a very famous, very well-verified
case, but it's certainly not the only one because three days later on August 30, three passengers on a bus driving
southeast of Minneapolis, one of these witnesses includes a 95year-old retired
Army engineer, Colonel said that they and the bus driver saw a twoft wide
multicolored ball of light come down right in front of the bus and apparently explode. quote louder and brighter than
a hand grenade going off. It actually shook the vehicle. And it was just one
week after that on October 6 that a retired couple was driving along I35 to
Duth in their 73 Buick. This is east of Barnum. when they saw a ball of light,
which they estimated was somewhere between the size of a basketball to a bathtub, blue and white in color, and it
flew at a very low elevation over their car. Their car drove another 500 ft and
then rolled to a stop, the engine completely dead. They flagged down
another car to get a jump start, but that didn't work. So, they called a tow truck, but they couldn't get it started
either. Turned out that the alternator was now malfunctioning. That had to be replaced
and the battery took all night to recharge, at which point the car worked. But the repair person said that it
looked as if the interior of the alternator had been through a fire, which was weird because the outside
looked just fine. A final case from this wave of sightings, and there are many others, occurred three weeks later on
October 29 to Steven Shoemaker, a military police officer and sergeant in
the US Army. He was driving east in his 1977 Chevy Nova with his wife Susan on
Highway 1 near Elvarado. This is when they saw a bright light ahead of them on the road. So,
Steven accelerated to over 80 miles hour. He said it was closer to 100 and
saw that the light was about 4 to 6 feet in diameter, just 4 feet above the road
and 100 yards ahead of him when it zoomed right past his car, actually
causing him to swerve off the road. At this point, it immediately darted about 3/4 to one mile ahead. Now, he was
angry, as he put it, pissed off. So, he took off after it again and again. and
he got within 300 ft of it when it zoomed right at him again causing him to swerve off the road and once again
zoomed ahead 3/4s to one mile ahead of him on the road. He said this object was
too bright to look directly at brilliantly light. A third attempt to
intercept this object produced the same result. Only this time, Steven says he
came to within 30 to 50 feet of the object, almost colliding. It again
zoomed ahead, forcing Steven and his wife to follow it if they wanted to continue their trip. Steven did try
flashing his headlights at it, even clicked them on and off, but could not elicit any response. And finally, this
light, this object just disappeared. This was very near the town of Warren
where Deputy Val Johnson had earlier had his encounter and it was hearing about
this encounter that prompted Steven Schumacher to report his case. Some
really interesting aspects to that sighting. You know, this is a case that probably would have gone completely
unreported had not the witness had a cousin who was friends with a prominent UFO research researcher. This just goes
to show once again that most cases go completely unreported. Also, the fact that it took
place during such an intense wave of encounters, I think adds another level of credibility to this sighting. The
witnesses obviously were not familiar with extraterrestrials and as we see in
so many cases did not want to go there and say that wow these are not people
from Earth. But clearly this was not a normal human. That's what the witnesses
says. And I think if you take a close look at their description, it's what we would call typical grays. But even grays
have a lot of variety among them. And that's true in this case. It's such a strange case. I can't imagine what it
must be like to drive up to a gray standing there in the middle of the road, one that refuses to move out of
the way. That that face off lasting 5 to 10 minutes. That's crazy. Just very
strange. A lot to learn from that case. And now let's move to another one which
is truly fascinating and of course very strange. This one I call 9 foot tall
humanoids. This occurred on the nights of February 11 and 12 in 1980 in a rural
area of Aljaserus, Spain. What I like about this case is it's certainly not a single
witness case. In fact, there are dozens upon dozens of people who saw the
UFOs flying around at this exact time. But only a very small group of five
witnesses decided to investigate closer and this resulted in an encounter with a
landed UFO and humanoids. So interesting. This case is
so amazing. It comes from Spanish researcher Fernando Gimenez del Oso who
is the author of several books on UFOs and the supernatural and also appeared in Jose Emanuel Garcia Bautista's book
Aes on Andaluchiat. Over the past few weeks of
February 1980, numerous people in the city of Aljaserus had talked about
seeing weird glowing objects darting across the sky. Some described them as white violet in color, but others who
got better views closer up so that these objects were actually dome-shaped had colored lights and would send down beams
of light onto the ground, darting around at high speeds and in perfect
silence. But things came to a head late at night on February 11, 1980 when
Raphael Tobahas and his wife, you can see Raphael here, went to visit some
friends in the area. Stepping out on the balcony, Raphael noticed unusual flashes
of light in the distance. He had heard about sightings in the area, but he
wasn't really thinking much about them, so he just returned inside. But later thinking about it, he took another look
and became very curious because he could see something unusual was definitely in
the sky sending down flashes of light wobbling around. So Raphael and his wife
decided to drive closer and investigate. They approached the entrance to Los
Adelid's school. And this is when they noticed a group of no less than 30 to 40
boys holding sticks and flashlights watching these strange lights from a
short distance away. Uh Raphael persuaded three of them to hop in the car, join he and his wife, and they
drove as close as they could get to these lights, which appeared to be on the slope of the Sierra Dejon Mountain.
It took a few kilometers to get there and they stopped. And this is when they now noticed a glowing whitish orange
object rising up from behind some nearby forested hills. It remained at very low
elevation as it appeared to separate itself into three separate objects or so
it appeared and then united back together into one. At this point they
used binoculars and watched as these object or objects descended towards the
ground in a sort of falling leaf motion. Now down on the ground they could see
two huge humanoid figures visible really only as silhouettes standing in front of
the glowing object. And they appeared to be very tall over 9 ft 3 m. And the
light from these objects was illuminating them enough that they could see that these figures were wearing
tight fitting gray green, what they called fresher suits. These figures then
began to make huge leaps and strides over the ground, easily surmounting very
large obstacles. Sometimes they'd move very quickly, but other times it was
very strange because they appeared to move in almost slow motion. They pretty much stayed at first only in front of
these glowing objects which would pulsate in intensity. At one point the
witnesses saw the beings move away and stop briefly by a small creek. They
appeared to look around and bend down and then without warning these two
figures suddenly began to move slowly towards the witnesses. The younger children that they had brought with them
began to become afraid and especially when these figures began to run towards
the witnesses. So the five witnesses instantly panicked with fear. They drove
frantically away from the area. And to their shock, these tall humanoids actually chased their vehicle for a few
minutes. Finally, they went around a corner in the road and that was the last they saw of these humanoids. But the
next day, Raphael returned to the site and he says he found strange footprints on the ground where they had seen these
beings. And that was not the only case in this area because the next evening, a
graveyard watchman just a few miles away says he was resting in his vehicle with
the doors and windows closed. He had been dozing when suddenly something pounded on the car window very hard. He
woke up, grabbed a stick he used for protection, and looked out the window. And to his shock, he says he saw an
entity. It had slanted eyes, greenish skin. He had the impression it was a
female. But he jumped out of his vehicle, and to his shock, this figure
dematerialized right in front of his eyes. Now, per researcher Manuel Ramirez, this area does have a history
of humanoid encounters going all the way back to September 1959 when around 2:30 a.m. one evening,
a worker at a pump house in Algoserus saw a glowing oval object hovering just
a few feet above the ground, and two short human-looking figures stood in
front of this object. Seeing the witness, the two short humanoids jumped into the craft which took off and left
the area. How about that? I mean, when you have a group of 30, 40 people watching a UFO, undeniable. I mean, it
always puzzles me when people say, you know, proof or it didn't happen or photographs or it doesn't exist. Get
real. How many cases does it take for people to accept that this is going on?
would be easy to dismiss 10 cases or even a hundred, but we're looking at thousands upon thousands of cases
reaching back decades if not hundreds of years. Uh, and multiple witness cases,
cases supported by landing traces, physiological effects, animal
reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, and more. So this is clearly not easily
dismissed as our military would like to say as hoaxes, hallucinations,
misperceptions, or mental illness. No, don't think so. Far too many cases to
explain away. And here is another one. I call this one really scared, but also
curious. Direct quote from the witness herself. What a brave lady. She walked
up to a landed UFO and humanoid. This one occurred one evening in the summer
of 1981 in a ver very rural area of Utah. What a case. This is so unusual.
This case first appeared on the UFO Sentinel website, but was also
republished in a volume of Albert Rosali's excellent series, Humanoid
Encounters: Aliens Amongst Us. The witness is anonymous, but she did send
her firstirhand testimony of this extraordinary encounter with a landed UFO and humanoids. So, the case has
never, as far as I know, been formally investigated. At the time of her encounter, the witness lived in a small,
unnamed town in rural Utah. She kept her encounter secret for 30 years before
finally submitting her case. It was the summer of 1991.
She had gone to visit a friend who lived a short distance away. And later that night, she was driving home. She was
about 2 miles from her home when her car mysteriously broke down. But since she
was only 2 miles from her house, she decided to just continue walking home and planned to return to her car in the
morning. And I'll just let the witness describe in her own words what happened next. About 5 minutes into my walk, a
bright object flew past me about as high as a treetop. The only sound it made was
the sound of the air as it went through it. I got really scared and threw myself
into the vegetation by the roadside to hide. The object was about as big as a
mobile home, shaped like a football, and was white with some gray panels. I saw
the object land by the road about 200 yd up the road. I hid in a bush just
watching. I couldn't see it very well. I was really scared, but also very
curious. I knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a real UFO close up. And I knew that if I
didn't try to take a closer look, I would regret it for the rest of my life.
So, I decided to sneak closer, even if it meant risking my life. When I got to
within 50 ft of it, I hid behind a bush. From this position, I could see
everything. I watched the UFO for about five or six minutes when a hatch opened and a figure came out. He looked like a
human, but shorter and had a strange looking face, but still humanlike.
Again, I decided this was a once in a-lifetime opportunity, and I was going to make the most of this incredible
chance I had been given. So, I stood up and I raised my right hand to greet him
and smiled. He noticed me. He got a real worried look and yelled something back
into the UFO. Then there was a bright flash and I must have passed out. I woke
up on the ground and the UFO was gone. I guess they didn't want to make contact.
I'm glad I did what I did and I would do the same again. These aliens did not want to hurt me, but they were doing
something in secret. Who knows what? Again, I think you'll agree that was
very strange. how I would love to talk to that witness directly. I wonder if this was a chance encounter given that
her car broke down. That's sort of a pattern we do see in a number of these cases. And what happens? This UFO flies
by and lands right in front of her. Another question I have about this case is the fact that she fainted, lost
consciousness while this encounter was still occurring. That is a huge red flag
which could very well point to this being more than just a sighting and
perhaps an onboard encounter. Can't say obviously because there's no indication
of that directly. But if I could talk to the witness, yeah, I have questions. But
kudos to her for walking up to this landed craft, waving at this humanoid and smiling and trying to make contact.
That's amazing. So really interesting case. Now let's move to another really
interesting case. Actually a series of cases. I call this one it was gone in
seconds. This one took place on August 13,
1983 in Algarabo, Puerto Rico. And again, not
just a singular event. A huge wave of sightings was going on at the time, but
it was only one witness who had a UFO come down right over his head and he
could see humanoids looking down at him. So interesting and so very strange.
Again, this case involves a series of sightings and was published in issue number 20 of the UFO Review by Timothy
Green Beckley. It was around 8:00 p.m. on August 12, 1983.
Numerous people in various locations in central Puerto Rico reported seeing a very large kind of cigar- shaped craft
moving overhead. Witnesses said that it had no wings, just a row of brilliant
amber lights along the side. One witness was Nilda Cruz of Bariata San Lou de
Albonito. And as she says, I went out to water the plants when all of a sudden I
saw that thing flying close to an airplane. The object suddenly went dark
and quickly moved towards the top of some nearby mountain. After the plane passed by, the object lit up again,
illuminating the mountain as well as the surrounding area. It remained there, suspended in the air for a few moments
and then took off at great speed towards the north. There were other witnesses,
including two brothers, Edgar and Ramon Marcado, who also provided the same
details as Nilda Cruz. And it was just two hours later that same evening that a
social service employee by the name of Angel Louise Zas was driving with three
friends through the Algarabo sector when they all saw a strange craft in the sky
which they said was shaped kind of like an overturned plate. As Angel says, "We
went down a slope. We suddenly saw a large luminous object with an orange glow. It had many small colored lights
around the edge which blinked blue and red. It came down low following the
slope of a nearby mountain. Then it went back up again moving towards Selenus
towards the sea. Immediately another object appeared and did exactly the same thing and disappeared following the
first object. My friends became very nervous insisting that I immediately
start the car so that we could leave the area which was what I did. I have never
seen anything like it before. The very next night, August 13, the UFOs were
back over Albanito. And as one witness said, a resident of the area, I thought
that the world was coming to an end. You know that it says in the Bible that things like this will be seen during the
last days. Even though I was frightened, I didn't say anything to my family about
it until now when I heard you talking to Mr. Zas. and I realized that it was the
same thing that I had seen. And as it turned out, this witness's neighbors
said that the UFOs were being seen in this area for the past few months. Now, the most interesting case
of all was that of a Mr. AC. Those are his initials. And he says that at 300
p.m. again on August 13, he was in the Los Polaris region of Algorabo looking
for archaeological relics which are known to be in this area. And as Mr. AC
says in his own words, "I was looking for Indian relics when I suddenly heard
what sounded like bees. When I looked up, I saw in front of me, about 50
meters away, hovering 70 ft above the ground, a silver pyramid-shaped object
with three rectangular-shaped windows. In the windows were three people. I was
not able to see their faces. They were looking at me. They wore helmets and tight fitting silver clothing. They had
on dark spectacles or visors, so that's all he could really see. He watched in
absolute amazement for a full 10 minutes, which is a long time, when the object suddenly took off towards the
direction of Selenus. And as he says, quote, it was gone within seconds. There
you go. That's the pattern we see in a number of these humanoid cases. It's not a singular event. often they occur
during a pretty active wave of sightings
again which adds a level of credibility to what's going on here. There's quite a
few interesting details in that particular series of events. One thing I
found fascinating is that some of the witnesses only came forward after learning that other people were having
encounters. This is an important detail because it shows how a series of UFO
encounters can go unreported because it takes one person to sort of break the ice to find the courage to go public
with their encounter. And that prompts other people, encourages other people to step forward. But if that one person
doesn't step forward, then probably nobody will. And this entire series of events goes completely undocumented,
uninvestigated, unrecorded. So that just goes to show again that this is probably a far more
common than is even believed among UFO researchers. Certainly that's what I'm
finding out in my own research. But some really interesting details as well in terms of the variety
of craft people are seeing. And the witness who saw the humanoids, I found it particularly fascinating that he
described his craft coming down towards him in a falling leaf motion. That's
pretty significant. This is something we see in quite a few genuine UFO encounters. So, yeah, a lot to unpack
there. Now, let's move to another case. This one I had to include even though I
really wasn't able to confirm its authenticity. I'm presenting it here and
letting you decide about that. But I call this one miniature UFO and
humanoid. This occurred one day in spring of 1984 in a rural area of
Vancouver, Washington. It's a single witness case involving a young boy who
saw a very, very tiny UFO and humanoid.
That's not unique, but it's certainly not common either. This very unusual
case comes from Dudley D. star and was published in volume 32 number 33 issue
of the flying saucer review. Dudley interviewed the witness, a young man,
apparently a child who is anonymous, but there are a good number
of cases involving very small UFOs and even smaller humanoids inside them. And
this is a very good example of this. It was one afternoon in spring of 1984 when
this witness, this young man was walking through a large treelined field enjoying
nature when he saw something very shocking. Sitting on the ground in front
of him was this shiny metallic discshaped craft only three feet wide.
It had a transparent glass-like dome on top. And always curious, the young man
bent down and was about to pick it up to examine it when suddenly he was amazed
to see quote a very tiny man. He said it had feet like a frog was holding on to
what appeared to be a control rod. Now even more curious, he picked this object
up, at which point the little man cringed back in his seat, apparently from fear, but quickly regained his
composure, and apparently still holding on to this control rod, the little manipulated it, and this little craft
began to emit a high-pitched hum. And moments later, it began to oscillate and
waver. Then very suddenly it broke free of the witness's grip, took off, and
darted away at high speed, vanishing into the distance. Now, the investigator, Dudley
Star, writes that the witness was very adamant that this happened and that this
story was true. Dudley writes, "The young man seemed to have suffered no ill
effects or felt any pain or discomfort from the experience other than the usual shock syndrome that one would expect to
accompany such an episode. The particular young man in question is not
a person prone to fantasy. No other details appear to be available about this affair, and there appears to be no
other witnesses who are prepared to comment upon it." Talk about very
strange. That's the kind of case that I think skeptics would find very easy to dismiss, not knowing that there is a
whole category involving people who have seen very tiny UFOs and humanoids. I'm
glad that the investigator spoke directly with the witness. And that I
think is important because he says this witness was adamant and sincere that
this did really happen to him. can only imagine what that must be like. And I
would imagine that most people who see something like that would keep it secret because when there's that much high
strangeness, who's going to believe you? It's crazy. This is one of the things
that keeps so many people from not talking. It's the ridicule and disbelief
surrounding this subject. Such a shame. Frankly, we're all victims, I think, of
our own government's brutal UFO cover up. It's been an enormous amount of
time, money, and energy in this very carefully orchestrated cover up of UFO
evidence and a disinformation fear campaign. Don't buy into it. It's not
true. I don't think we have anything to fear from these guys who are far more
advanced than certainly we here are here on our planet where we're committing
genocide and destroying the environment and leading ourselves on a pathway
towards self-destruction. Certainly unsustainable and that is the message
ETSs have been giving over and over and over again. All right, let's move on to the
next case. This one's quite short. There's not a whole lot of evidence to it, but it's got some very interesting
and bizarre details. I call this one, what I saw was 4 feet tall. This one
occurred on March 20, 1997 in Port Perry, Ontario. And while this case
wasn't professionally researched, it does come directly from the witness himself who provided a firstirhand
testimony, which is, as you'll see, quite sincere. But yeah, the reason I
wanted to include this is because it contains some elements which I think are quite important and insightful to our
understanding of what it's like to have ET contact. This short case comes from
the reader section of the QOR bulletin of the Canadian UFO Research Network. A
gentleman wrote a letter describing his account only two weeks after it occurred. So, it has not apparently been
formally investigated, but nevertheless, it is a very sincere firsthand account
and provides some interesting and unusual details of an encounter with a humanoid. The witness uses the pseudonym
of Link Fairway and he was apparently in his home located in Port Perry, Ontario,
Canada, when two or more grey type ETSs showed up. As the witness wrote in his
letter, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. For some reason, I looked at the clock. It was
12:43 a.m. What I saw was about 4t tall
and grayskinned. The first one moved its arms up and down, and it seemed like it
was in slow motion. Its hands had three fingers, or two fingers and a thumb.
Either way, it was claw-like. They looked very reptilian with ridges around their eyes as if to support their eyes.
Their bodies were incredibly skinny. Then I looked back at the clock and it said
12:46. So 3 minutes had passed in what seemed like a second. I include a
drawing of one of them. That is the best drawing I can do. It's not very good. I
know. So the witness does not describe what happened next, but presumably the figures were gone. To me, some of the
important details of that case is a sort of sense of time distortion. How the witness felt like the ET was moving in
slow motion. How he thought he viewed this entity for just a few seconds, but
had a very clear sense of what time it was and found when he looked back at the clock that more time had passed than he
thought. That is certainly something that comes up quite often. makes me wonder about the possibility of missing
time, but also important because people are seeing ETs all over the world, but
most often it's in their own homes. I don't think people realize it. This is probably the most common place you're
going to see an ET is in your own home, usually in your bedroom. So I think that
alone is an important detail. But this does appear in many ways to be your typical encounter with a gray type ET.
But still very strange, very interesting, and a lot to learn from each of these cases. Each provides
another piece of the puzzle to what's going on here. So let's move to the next case. I call this one we can find you.
This one occurred one evening in January of 2007 in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is a
single witness case. This person apparently has had a number of encounters and this is just one of them,
but boy is it unusual. Here's another case which again is quite brief. This
comes from researcher Linda Molton How. The main witness is an anonymous defense
contractor who reports having several encounters. So, this is just one of them. It was one evening around 9:30
p.m. in mid January of 2007 that he stepped out of his place of employment,
which was located in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was just taking a break to smoke a cigarette when, without warning,
he started to hear a strange beeping sound in his ear. Now, he at first assumed that this must be coming from a
nearby forklift that was being operated, and he ignored it. But this became
impossible when moments later an overwhelming fear consumed him for no
reason that he could see. Looking around, he saw nothing. But then he looked up and he saw it. A gray
extraterrestrial hovering about 20 ft in the air above him. As he says, the
figure wore a dark cloak similar to a long trench coat or a monk's cloak which
hid the body. All he could see was the witness's head. All he could see was
this being's head, which he said was oversized, bald, with large black
slanted almond-shaped eyes. No real nose was visible, just two nostril holes, and
it had a slit for a mouth. He said this figure appeared to be about 4 to 4 and
1/2 ft tall, and he became a little panicky as he felt that he quote could
not run or hide. At this point, this being transmitted a telepathic message
directly to the witnessed saying, "We can find you whenever we want to." And
it immediately rose upwards and disappeared into the night. Can you imagine just taking a break at work,
stepping out to smoke a cigarette, and then suddenly getting this weird feeling that somebody's watching you and looking
up and there is a gray ET wearing a robe floating 20 ft above your head looking
down at you and it has a message. We can find you whenever we want to. Uh, I
can't blame this witness for being frightened, but I still think it's kind of interesting that people have such a
strong fear reaction in so many of these incidents. Not blaming them. I'm not
judging them, don't get me wrong, but nothing really happened to him. All that this ET did was say, "We are able to
locate you." Uh, which is absolutely true. We see this in so many cases.
Don't think it that it's implants that are causing this because that is a theory that a number of people have
speculated about. My research to implants shows they're likely health related, not used for tracking, but
certainly an interesting case. And yeah, really
unusual. Now, let's move to the last case in this collection. Can't say I've heard one quite like this before. I call
this one a grays in the bedroom. This one occurred on April 11, 2013 quite
recently in Katania, Italy. This is a suburb and a really unusual case where
this witness had a very close encounter with a gray ET and caught this gray ET
apparently taking her mother. So yeah, very strange. This case comes from
Italian researchers Salvatore Foresta and Antonio Rampulla and was published
in the Italian UFO publication UFO Revisista the Infirmazion Euphological
or Eupfology magazine. The witness Alexia, that's a pseudonym, is
anonymous. It was around 2:15 or 2:30 a.m. thereabouts on April 11, 2013 when
she woke up to realize that she was actually standing in front of her parents' bedroom for no reason that she
could imagine. So she opened the bedroom door and boy did she get a shock because
on doing so she immediately noticed a small figure which we now know to be a
gray ET. He was short, four and a half feet tall, about the same height as she
was, with a disproportionately large bald head, huge black eyes, no apparent
nose, a very small mouth, appeared not to be wearing any clothes, and was
standing next to her mother's bed. To Alexia's absolute shock and amazement,
her mother was quote, suspended in midair. She was in a vertical position
just a few inches above the ground with her toes still touching the floor very
lightly. She was perfectly still and was clearly in a trance or unconscious and
her head was pointing downwards. But Alexia had the very distinct impression
that the gray was levitating her mother. Now looking at the gray ET, she could
see its arms were colored with a kind of splotchy fluorescent green is how she put it. Frightened by this very surreal
scene, she immediately closed the door, but apparently was curious enough to
immediately reopen it and saw that the gray and her mother were still in the exact same position. But at this point,
the entity turned towards Alexia. She had the feeling that this gray ET seemed
to be shocked by her presence and was somewhat frozen in place. So Alexia, now
confirming that her eyes were not playing tricks on her, panicked, ran into the bathroom, locked the door, hid
in the bathtub, and prayed that this strange figure wouldn't capture her. She felt bad later for being so cowardly,
but explained that quote, "There are no words for what happened. I was waiting for everything to
disappear. So, after several moments of cowering in fear, she ran back into her
bedroom, which she shared at that time with her infant son. Looking at the clock, she could now see it was 3:15
a.m. She did turn on the light, lay down next to her son, but finally summoned
the courage to creep back into her parents' bedroom, and saw that now they were both in bed. She returned to her
room, but throughout the night she checked back on them several times, and everything appeared to be in order. The
next morning, her mother woke up as normal and had no memory of anything unusual happening. But in the days that
followed, there were a few other strange incidents. One evening, Alexia woke up
and saw quote diffused blue light like a cloud pass overhead.
And another morning she woke up to find a strange sticky substance on her hands that she has no idea how that got there.
But these events so frightened her that she began to sleep with a knife next to her bed just in case something else
happened. She had no idea how to interpret these experiences until she later shared them with a friend of hers
and they went on the internet and realized that this was likely an encounter with a gray extraterrestrial.
was then that she examined her body and noticed a strange mark. She did not know how that got there. Also, significantly,
20 years earlier, in September of 1993, as a teenager, she was sitting outside
her grandmother's house in Mr. Bianco, Katania, when she saw what she describes
as a flashooking metallic object approaching in the sky. said it was
about as high as a five-story building, not very high, but after approaching
her, it quickly moved off at great speed. So, after interviewing her, the researchers Salvatore Festa and Antonio
Rampula were absolutely convinced of her sincerity and honesty. They believed she
was telling the truth, and it was clear to them that whatever happened to her, she was left somewhat traumatized. An
important and unusual case. I'm glad it was researched by investigators familiar with this subject. Some of the details
of this case are just fascinating. Can only imagine what it must be like to open your parents' bedroom door and see
your mother floating right above the floor there with a gray ET who has this
kind of look of shock on his face. Very interesting. Can't blame the
witness for slamming the door and running and hiding in the bathroom. uh because that has to be pretty
shocking. But I also find it significant that she had an earlier UFO sighting
that there were unusual events that followed this particular encounter because that is a pattern we see. I
suspect this is a family who are themselves UFO contacties as we know
that's another pattern we see. uh UFO encounters seem to happen in families
certain you know generational is what I'm trying to say uh this is a phenomena
that follows family lines so that could be what's happening in this case in all
these cases I wish I could interview these witnesses in more depth because there's a lot more I think than what I
can present here but it's enough to give a pretty accurate an overview of what it's like to have extraterrestrial
contact. So, there you go. 12 very strange cases all the way back to 1940
up to 2013, showing that this has been going on for a very long time, coming
from all over the world, showing that this is worldwide, showing a wide variety of humanoid types, certainly the
same sort of thing we have on our own planet with a wide variety of humans. But yeah, all humanoid, which I think is
super significant and points towards the message a number of contactes have gotten directly from the ETSs, that we
share a common heritage, that we share a common ancestry, that our relationship to these guys is much closer than we
might imagine. But yeah, 12 cases, just the tip of the iceberg. We know there's
thousands upon thousands upon thousands of these cases. So, don't try to tell me
that this can be explained away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. I'm not buying it. I
think people who put that forth are just victims of the UFO coverup. Have
not done an objective investigation. I don't mean to be rude, but do your homework and you will see that this has
been going on for so long and there's so many cases and it's undeniable. All you
have to do is step outside and look up at the stars and see just how wide and
infinite space is. There's simply no possibility. It's inconceivable that we
would be the only life in the universe. And I think these cases are showing us that obviously we aren't. So that's it
for today. Thank you guys. I truly appreciate your support. Truly appreciate you tuning in and watching my
show. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for
the truth. It's up to you to find it. And most important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next week for a
new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. Bye for now.
