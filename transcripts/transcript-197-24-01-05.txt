UNDENIABLE: FIVE TRUE UFO ENCOUNTERS
Jan 5, 2024

Summary:
Jan 5, 2024
While there are those who are skeptical that UFOs exist, the truth is that the evidence for extraterrestrials is undeniable. Landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, physiological effects…the list goes on. And when cases like these have multiple eyewitness testimonies, the evidence cannot be ignored or explained away. This video presents five exceptional cases with undeniable evidence.

UFO LANDING AT SOUTH HILL, VIRGINIA. On the evening of April 21, 1967, Clifton Crowder was driving along Ferrell Road to his home in South Hill, Virginia when he noticed a shiny silver craft landed on the street in front of him. As he flicked on his high-beams, the craft belched a stream of flames and took off like a bullet straight up. The craft was gone, but left behind was a huge burn-mark on the road, and four evenly spaced holes gouged into the macadam surface. He went straight to the police and reported the incident. Unknown to him, dozens of people in the area were reporting UFOs flying around at treetop level, including police officers and firemen. UFO researchers converged on the case and declared it genuine. Project Blue Book was contacted and they were unable to identify the craft and labeled it unexplained, Case#11677.

UFO LANDS AT IOWA FARM. It was around 10:00 pm on August 6, 1971 when Don Ede looked outside his home in Westgate, Iowa and saw a brilliant flash in the sky, followed by a red-orange object which dropped down into his neighbor’s field. Unknown to Don, Mike Potratz who lived a short distance away also noticed the flash and the strange object. The next morning, both Don and Mike woke up early and went to investigate the farm of John Bantz, where they had seen the object come down. Together, joined by a member of the Bantz family, they found a 10-foot-wide circle of burned vegetation, surrounded by four smaller circles situated evenly around the circumference. Unknown to any of them, two other people were driving near the area two hours before Don and Ede saw the UFO and were chased down the road by an unknown object.

THE COLBY, KANSAS UFO LANDING. At 2:00 am, on August 19, 1972, John I. Calkins woke up to see UFOs swooping down over his home in Gem, Kansas. He immediately called the local police in Colby, Kansas. Patrolman Paul Carter was sent to investigate, but before he could get there, the police officer came upon a landed UFO. He called for backup and his fellow officer, Dennis Brown arrived and watched the craft take-off. He saw that the craft was heading for nearby Oakley, and called their sheriff’s station. They came out and saw the UFO too. Meanwhile, they headed to John Calkins’ home in Gem, and the UFOs were still there. Meanwhile, the Colby police station was flooded with calls. The UFOs flew around all night long. It would be an experience that convinced many people that UFOs are real.

MISSING TIME IN PRINCE GEORGE. At 4:10 am on January 5, 1977, 17-year-old Kirk Alore drove along Hwy 16 outside of Prince George, Canada. He noticed an oncoming car, and at the same time, saw a strange red light zooming towards it. Suddenly, the object approached him, and he realized it was a UFO. His body became numb as his car radio filled with static, his headlights failed and the engine died. The last thing he remembered was seeing the oncoming car come right at him, the UFO overhead, and then slamming on his brakes. He fell unconscious and woke up to find himself sitting in the passenger seat of his car. The other driver woke him up and told Kirk that he himself had also had missing time and woke up outside his car. Kirk was sore for a week, had a persistent headache, and his car battery was dead. Soon he would have more experiences and this time, he had more witnesses.

THE GREENFIELD UFO LANDING. Around 7:00 pm on Nov 8, 1975, Cathy Wilfong and Cindy Bridges were at their farm in Greenfield, Indiana when the power kept mysteriously going off. Two hours later, a huge UFO appeared over their soybean field. Their dog barked wildly and they fled to their house and called the police. When the police arrived, the UFOs had moved off into the distance, but were still visible. Meanwhile, calls flooded into the station from people reporting the UFOs. The next morning, Cathy and Cindy found a 44-foot-wide circle of crushed vegetation, tightly woven and matted together. When they went public with their story, many other witnesses stepped forward to report their own sightings in that area on that night.

These five cases provide compelling, if not conclusive, evidence of UFO reality. Those who remain skeptical of UFOs have simply not done their research. The evidence is there for those who have the courage to examine it. These five cases are just the tiniest percentage of the actual number of cases, the vast majority of which goes completely unreported. The evidence speaks for itself. UFOs are real! We are not alone!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called undeniable five true UFO encounters so today I want to focus on
cases that I think are undeniable and by that I mean cases with a lot of evidence
cases with a lot of witnesses and I have only five cases today because each of these are really extensive and do
contain a lot of evidence including Landing traces electromagnetic
disturbances animal reactions physiological evidence and more the
cases I'm presenting today come from across the United States but one is from
Canada they have a lot of witnesses these are absolutely undeniable
cases so I think you know it's important that people recognize there is evidence
to support the reality of UFOs it always makes me kind of shake my head when
people say where's the evidence I've said it many times but it's worth repeating the best evidence we have is
the huge number of cases it's undeniable that this is a true phenomena anyone who
takes even the briefest look at the evidence can only come away convinced presuming you know they can do this
objectively but these five cases I think alone present enough evidence to prove
Pro the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrial visitations on our
planet so that's the theme of today's show I hope you find it interesting
there's some really remarkable Landing cases a missing time encounter all
different kinds of encounters that are absolutely undeniable so the first case I'd like to
talk about today is I call UFO landing at South Hill
Virginia this one created a huge uproar in the UFO Community the debunkers came
out in full force I think because it has such good evidence to it as we'll see
this one occurred on April 21st 1967 of course in South Hill Virginia a
small little town but boy something happened there on that day that put that
town on the map the crime primary witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of Clifton Crowder who at the
time of this encounter was the manager and former owner of the mobile chemical
fertilizer plant also a veteran of the Air Force from World War II so he was an
active member of this small town of South Hill Virginia Which then had a
population of about 3,000 people he was very well respected and in fact Sergeant
CE Reigns of the Virginia State Police said
prowder is the finest man in our area now the evening of April 21st
1967 would have a profound impact on Clifton's life and really the whole town
on that evening he had worked until about 900 p.m. he was just leaving the
mobile plant to drive the short distance to his home he turned off the little dirt road and onto the paved surface of
feral Road it was paved with maadam this will be an important detail as we'll see
and I'll just let Clifton Crowder describe what happened in his own words
as he says when I hit the hard surface I saw the huge Craft on the road it had a
shiny metallic appearance and was highly reflective my immediate Med reaction was
to throw my lights up on highbeam so I could see what it was I saw the craft
clearly for at least 5 Seconds it was about half the height of a large metal
storage tank perhaps 12 ft in diameter and 15 to 20 ft High it seemed to be
sitting on legs about 3 ft High suddenly there was a blinding flash of white fire
from the bottom of the thing I don't remember hearing any sound at all I
thought I saw the craft go up from the ground but all of this happened fast and
the intense light may have blinded me for an instant when I was over the surprise I bent down and looked up
through the windshield I didn't see anything in the sky except the moon and some clouds but there was a fire on the
road directly beneath the place where the craft had been it looked as if
something had ignited the Macadam surface the fire must have burned for about 20
seconds while I was making up my mind to go by finally it began to die down and I
headed for the Town police station I felt that I wouldn't be a responsible
citizen without reporting what I saw unbelievable though it may have been it
was just a funny feeling you can imagine how it felt to see a big thing like that
sitting in the road in front of you and all of a sudden a ball of Fire Flies out and it
disappears it went straight up in the air like a bullet it was just a Flash and it was gone and when I had my bright
lights on I got a perfect look at it so yeah this was apparently a
metallic craft which reminded him of a sort of metal
tank and off it went very quickly so although it was a brief sighting he did
get a good look at it he says this object was no more than 300 ft from him
and he arrived at the police station at precisely 9:04
p.m. he told the officers what had happened and they returned to the scene with him and shortly later two other
officers came up the burnt spot on the road was plainly visible and in fact was
still hot they measured it it was 3 and 1/2 ft long and about 2 ft wide and
Clifton personally was glad to see it because it proved that he had not imagined this
sighting now at this point he's offering no conclusion about what he saw he
wondered actually if it might have been quote some object the government is experimenting with and the general
public knows nothing about so this is when the investigation
began uh Clifton the next day went to the home of Norman Martin who lived
about 12 1,00 ft away from the spot where he had seen this craft he's the
closest house to it and I'll just let Clifton describe what happened as
Clifton says in his own words I asked Norman if he'd heard or seen anything
unusual around 9 the night before Norman said he had he'd been standing in his
backyard and all of a sudden he noticed the biggest burst of light he'd ever seen it cast a light on an tree just a
few feet down the road from where I saw the craft Norman told me it was so bright he could have shot a bird right
out of the tree if he'd wanted to that's pretty bright at about 400
yards so later researchers did find other Witnesses they learned that Linda
Clark another Resident who lived nearby said that at the time of the incident
she saw an intense flash of light and so apparently did her young child who had
been sound asleep in bed but woke up and cried out in
Surprise and as it turned out there were quite a few Witnesses five South Hill residents said
that they saw strange lights around 9:30 and they were talking back and
forth about it on their CB radios they described it as a red glowing sphere which was changing in
color from Orange to Yellow was dropping down to Treetop level coming back up
appearing to divide into two objects which came back together and dropped down again they then came back up and
now there were three objects one of the men Roy Edmonds stopped his car and
tried to call the police from his home but it was weird his phone was strangely
not operating so he went back out and he could see this cluster of lights still
moving up and down and there were more witnesses around 8:30 p.m. an hour before the five
South Hill residents with the radios and a half hour prior to Clifton Crowder's
report South Hill Police dispatcher Norman ball and four others said that
they saw quote a pinkish ball of fire which was moving around at Treetop level
they said it was stationary at first then moved slowly away and disappeared behind a hill
now several members of the Fort Lee fire department said that around 9:15 p.m.
they saw two strange red lights revolving in the sky for about 5 minutes
this is just 50 m east of South Hill Virginia one of them James hakos
described how they saw this light descend to an altitude of about 600 ft
then it came straight at them turned 90° and moved slowly towards the
Northeast and there were still more witnesses police chief Bill Williams of
Lacrosse which is just three miles Southeast of South Hill he said that he
and several other officers saw five what looked like star-like lights rising up
from the ground in the South Hill area and moving to the Northeast and police chief Bill Williams
got in his Cruiser and chased one of these lights for about 2 miles racing up to 75 mph he said the object he chased
was at about Treetop level and he said quote that he's never seen anything like
that so back to Clifton Crowder's event
as the police returned the next day to investigate they were looking at the road in the burn spot and they found
more evidence they found four small hole Holes surrounding the burn spot they were
about an inch deep an inch and a half wide or rather a half inch wide and
spaced evenly in a rectangular pattern about 12 ft apart and they speculated
that these holes may have been caused by The Landing legs of The Craft that Clifton had
described and there were more weird events to follow it was just 18 hours after Clifton's
sighting of this landed UFO on the road long before there was any publicity about it Clifton said he was approached
by an Air Force Colonel and a sergeant who questioned him extensively about the
sighting now they did a lot of investigating to find out who this Air
Force colonel was and he has never been located but this story this sighting
started to get a lot of attention particularly because of the landing traces and crowds started to
show up to take a look at it newspaper reporters interviewed Clifton Crowder
and articles began to appear in various newspapers this is when Jay Allen Heek
who is of course a consultant to Project Blue Book the Air Force UFO study
project I'll put that in quotes uh but J Allen heinik heard about the encounter
and he couldn't come there himself so he sent his assistant William T powers to
investigate and William Powers began of course by interviewing Clifton Crowder
and he was immediately impressed with his sincere testimony in fact William
Powers told the police quote prowder is telling exactly what he saw and there is
no reason reason to disbelieve him however I can't account for what he
saw so the police really wanted to do some further investigation and they tried to see if they could duplicate the
holes in the pavement by forcing a half inch bolt into the
Macadam of course they couldn't do this so they next tried to reproduce the burn
mark the heat source and along with William Powers they tried first kerosene
onto the road and lighting it with a blowtorch but it wouldn't ignite without
a wick they also tried gasoline and while it did Burn It produced clouds of
black smoke it streaked all over the place and none of this matched what Clifton said he saw
furthermore the gasoline burned on the road for about 20 minutes where Clifton
said that what he saw was about one minute of flames
and as William Powers says we investigated the idea of a hoax but we
couldn't prove it now William Powers did remove samples
of the burn spot on the road and sent them off to can probably guess where wri
Patterson Air Force Base for analysis Wright Patterson is of course UFO
Central where they study foreign aircraft so that makes sense but it's certainly interesting because they did
agree to analyze this sample and it gets more interesting the
results were inconclusive they said while the Macadam surface did show
evidence of high heat there was no evidence of any fuel
source and Dr J Allen heck said that Crowder's experience quote defied
explanation now this is when the debunkers started to come in and rumors began to spread that three burned
matches were found at the site laying neatly side by side this report came a
few days after the investigation there's no photo evidence to back it up or any report on who allegedly found these
matches I think personally that this is an attempt to discredit Crowder's story
that's my personal speculation perhaps matches were found however it made
little difference in the story itself as the analysis of the road showed no
presence of a fuel accelerant and there was still the matter of the four evenly
spaced holes surrounding the burn spot which could not be explained or easily
hoaxed not to mention the fact that there were so many witnesses to activity
in this area at that time nevertheless famous debunker Philip class devoted no
less than 19 pages to this case in his book UFOs explained and tried very hard
to label this incident as a hoax but he couldn't find anyone who could cast any
dispersions on the main witness Clifton Crowder whose reputation in the
community was Sterling there was some speculation that Clifton may have been the victim of a
prank but again there was no evidence of this whatsoever debunkers tried to focus
on the fact that this fertilizer Factory had tanks next to it and that he had
mistaken the object in the road for one of the tanks uh which makes zero sense
there was also a theory being floated around that he had seen ball lightning
which fails to match even closely what Crowder had seen nor could it explain
the four holes in the pavement nor the many other sightings other people had
reported so ultimately the Air Force Project Blue book labeled this case case
number 11677 as unexplained and today the case
remains a mystery and given the huge number of eyewitnesses again who saw unexplained UFO activity both before
during and after Crowder's sighting it seems undeniable that something
unexplained occurred when debunkers attack a case like this so viciously to
me that definitely raises eye brows if this is a hoax as say Philip class
admits why is he spending so much attention to it just dismiss it I think
this is because it's a valid case and it clearly is with so many other Witnesses
who saw UFO activity before and after Clifton Crowder saw this UFO land in the
middle of the road and leave these absolutely undeniable Landing traces
what a case and there's so many others here's another one that's definitely
worth looking into it's not well known at all I call this one UFO lands at Iowa
farm and this is actually a cluster of incidents there was a lot of activity
going on at this time in this area this particular case occurred on April 6th
1971 in Westgate Iowa and I like this case because there are multiple
Witnesses from separate areas who watch this UFO come down and land and of
course it left Landing traces and there are corroborating cases that occurred
around that time in that area as well so it's a really remarkable series of events this next case is much more brief
but there's a whole cluster of events that surround it this one occurred around 1 p.m. again April 6th
1971 when Don Eid age 17 looked out his
outside his home in Westgate and saw this brilliant flash of light in the sky
followed by a red orange glowing object which he watched drop down from the sky
and appear to hover or land a short distance away no unknown to him
in a short distance away Mike Potratz aged 17 was in his house and he saw the
same exact thing a flash followed by a brightly lit object coming down for an
apparent Landing so again this was at 10: p.m. the next morning both boys hiked to the
location where they had seen this object come in for a landing they had to go to
school that day but they went before school and where they had seen it come in for landing was at a small farm owned
by James bance so they went to investigate and they were joined by Russell B Don and
Mike went to the B farm and this is when they were amazed to see this circular
area of burned vegetation which was about 10 ft wide and surrounding this
circle of burned vegetation were four smaller circles evenly spaced around
their circumference so clearly an object containing a high heat Source had landed
on the farm that's all we know about that case but in confirmation of it is another
case which occurred on the very same evening not far away in aola Iowa and
I'll just quote the anonymous witness directly he reported his case to UFO
organizations and as he says and I quote I was 10 years old me and my dad's
friend were traveling down US Highway 34 going back to Murray Iowa it was about
8:00 p.m. I looked out the window at the stars that's when I noticed the disc it
was about four or 5T in diameter I asked my Dad's friend what is that he didn't
notice it at first when he did I asked him what's that he said I don't know it
followed us about 15 ft above the car I don't remember how long but when we got
to the house we told my mom and dad and my dad's friend's wife they started
laughing at us and said we were crazy my Dad's friend told me to forget about it so I did it was years later in 2009 that
he was surfing the internet and heard about UFOs and this is when he suddenly remembered the encounter which
apparently had left his mind something we do see in these UFO encounters but
incredible corroboration of an event of this Landing you know which he saw this
just what two hours before this Landing
in Westgate Iowa now apparently UFOs seem to be very interested in Iowa farms in 1971 because
consider this report which occurred in Sue City about three months before the Westgate case on January 15
1971 and again I'll just quote the witness directly as he says my friend
and I were on a country Highway between Sue City and Westfield Iowa we were
coming up on a farmer's house and both of us yelled out what's that we pulled
off to the side of the road and turned the car off we watched a UFO hovering over the farmer's house very close to
the the roof then it slowly started moving towards us we just sat in our car
and watched it moved to my side of the car and stopped I believe it was looking
at us and we at them it had a few small lights and the sound didn't sound like
anything I have heard before it was very quiet after a couple minutes it started
moving across the highway and over a cornfield after a matter of seconds it went very fast and disappeared in the
distance over cornfields and further
corroboration there was another UFO landing at an Iowa farm on that same year September 1st in Humbolt Iowa which
was about 200 miles from Westgate for us that's a pretty long distance but for a
UFO what far four or five seconds they can make it there but as the witness
says and again I quote my brother and I were traveling in eastbound on State
Highway 3 approximately four to 5 miles west of Humbolt Iowa the sky was clear
and there was not any other traffic I was returning him home to our parents as
he was 13 or 14 years old he had been visiting me in the western part of the state we were talking as I drove along
and as if out of a science fiction movie a large craft just appeared above and to
the left of the road about one or two miles in front of us I mean I was
looking ahead and when this large craft just appears in the sky it was
descending and was tilted down at about a 45° angle it then leveled itself over
the highway then descended again tilted down as before and left my sight as
there was a Farm building site with a Grove of trees blocking my sight that's when I turned
to my brother brother and I found him looking at me at the same time we both said did you see that we're still
traveling East and getting closer to where we saw this thing land and I say land because we're in Iowa and we can
see the farm place and all around the vicinity for a long way I mean we were
really wondering what this was going to look like on the ground and close enough to the road to throw a rock at and be
able to hit it to make a point probably a minute after we lost it from
sight we were passing the farm place and there wasn't anything there except a harvested
beanfield we arrived at our parents house a couple of hours later and told them about what we had
seen understand it's been 33 34 years since this took place but our oldest
sister who was 17 at the time it was either one or two weeks later brought my
attention to the de Mo's Sunday register on the front page the second bold type
heading read mysterious burn spots found in soybean
Fields so newspaper accounts showed more Landings at Iowa Farms continuing
through 1972 clearly there was something going on there so it seems undeniable that
UFOs at that time certainly were finding Iowa Farms a location of intense
interest UFOs do seem to love visiting farms for whatever reason I mean we
could certainly speculate about that but the fact is there are a lot of cases where UFOs are landing at farms and
leaving behind evidence of all different kinds just love that case and here's
another one that is so amazing I call this one the kby Kansas UFO landing and
this is really a remarkable case which occurred on August 19 1972 of course in
Colby Kansas and in surrounding areas this one involves a huge number of
witnesses including quite a few police officers uh this is not necessarily a
singular event though I am going to focus mostly on one event the fact is a
lot of stuff was going on on that night and it was a really amazing series of
events that deserves a lot more attention than I think it's gotten so that's why I wanted to include it on
this list and I am sure you'll agree it's a fascinating series of UFO
Encounters this case is so amazing it was at exactly 207 a.m. august 19
1972 When A call came into the Thomas County Sheriff's Office which covers
Colby Kansas reporting a UFO and the call came from
23-year-old John a hulkin he was awakened 7 minutes earlier at 2 a.m. by
his dogs barking and looking outside he saw three glowing objects in the sky
over his mobile home this is in the town of jam which is right next to Colby Kansas he went
outside these objects quickly rose out of sight and disappeared but the
strangeness was n over yet because as John Caulkins says then I heard funny noises high
pitch sounds and swooshing sounds like a vacuum cleaner so he went inside and
called the police then went back outside and saw the objects again they were flashing changing different colors fact
they lit up the area so bright that he could see his dog outside and his dog
was putting its head on the ground apparently trying to cover its ears as John says I knew then these were high
shrilling sounds and as he watched an object dropped down and get this
appeared to land on the roof of a quan set building about 150 ft away from his
trailer he said this object was pretty big about 25 to 35 ft in diameter he
estimates 15 to 20 ft tall and your classic saucer shape with a dome on top
up and as John Caulkins says in his own words the lights on it were so bright I
couldn't stand to look at it when I seen that one I got so scared I got cold I
broke out in Goosebumps I had to turn on the heater in the trailer so this is when he called the
police and patrolman Paul Carter was sent to investigate and little did he
know he wouldn't get there and he was about to drive into the most unusual
experience of his life so he left the police station in Colby Kansas went down
Main Street turned South onto Country Club Drive as you can see here and just
before reaching Interstate 70 off to his left in a field he saw something he
would never forget so I'll just let patrolman Paul
Carter describe how all of this occurred as he says in his own words I
saw an object coming out of the Northeast and a southwesterly direction it was big very bright changing from red
and green blinking colors to bright white so bright you couldn't look at it
it lit up the pasture I watched this object for 15 to 20 seconds all the time
it was flashing red and green it resembled a cereal bowl turned upside down and it was about 35 ft wide and
about 18 to 20 ft long now when he first saw it it was quite low about 200 to 300 ft high he
chased it for a few minutes traveling about 50 to 60 m per hour when it
suddenly stopped swung back and stopped over the field east of Country Club
Drive North of the interstate 70 and at this point it's hovering about
300 ft away and came down uh either Landing in the field or was about no
more than 10 say 15 ft above the ground and lit up the surrounding area super
bright bright enough that Paul could see
the jack rabbits in the field in fact it was bright enough to illuminate the entire interior of his
vehicle and he said as it hovered there he could see little bits of quote white stuff that were dropped dropping down
but looked like they were dissolving before they hit the ground but he said the mere sight of this craft was
unnerving and this was when it flared up so brightly he couldn't even look at it
and I'll just let Paul give a little description as he says patrolman Paul
Carter it sure doesn't make you feel like getting out and dancing the
minuette it's Eerie we all kind of laughed at this stuff in the past but
after two 207 this morning I changed my opinion real fast I was a firm
non-believer until 7 minutes after 2 but I found I could change my mind pretty
fast so seeing this UFO just sitting there he immediately radioed for
assistance back at the station and patrolman Dennis Brown answered the call
and immediately headed for the area meanwhile Paul is watching this UFO for
about 8 minutes total when suddenly the object quote made a whoosing sound and
went straight up into the sky with the intense white light going out as it
lifted off it didn't shut off any lights it just went straight up so it disappeared he says in about 3
seconds but Officer Dennis Brown is approaching Paul's location and looking
over his shoulder he saw a quote streak of light going west to east on the
horizon but I really didn't have time to wonder because I I was on my way to help
Carter this was apparently a separate craft because then he saw a glow coming
up from behind the hill and he was just about there when he watched this
UFO take off and he like patrolman Paul Carter watched this craft move across
the sky and he had the presence of mind to grab his instatic camera and snap a
photo as Dennis says in his own words I saw a shot of light go straight up into
the air and then Veer or level off to travel in a southwesterly
direction it was weird but it made a Believer out of me before I always
thought people who reported these sightings had been tipping The Jug and then thought they saw what they
reported so needless to say he changed his mind about UFOs just like officer
Paul Carter Dennis Brown noticed that this light was heading towards Oakley
which is about 20 mi away so he called the Oakley police station and told them to be on the lookout for strange objects
in the sky and 3 minutes later they called back as it turned out officer
earlwood Jr saw the UFO and as he says there appeared to be six lights on the
object the three to the rear being white and the three to the front being either
Amber or red and green they continuously flashed from dim to Bright there was no
trouble identifying that it was a circular object so like officer Carter officer
Woods noticed that this object looked like it was Dripping this weird white substance which disintegrated before it
hit the ground he said it hovered for about 5 minutes and then darted away
so now Paul Carter and Dennis Brown head over to Jem to talk to John Caulkins
this is just a few miles to the East and when they arrived there they were amazed to see that this UFO had returned and
now it was flashing multicolored lights the officers looked absolutely shocked
John said as John culan says in his own words they were white as sheets I never
seen a police officer as scared as that in my life so the two officers actually
watched this object from their patrol cars and then it was just hovering in place so Paul wanted to see if it was
moving it at all so he used a sort of ingenious technique as he says we
extended an arm locking it and bracing it against the car roof and citing the
UFO over an extended thumb and they could see that this object was in fact
sort of swaying back and forth in a rocking motion so they then returned to kby and
these UFOs were still in the sky and they watched them for the next few hours joined by a crowd of 15 to 20 other
people in the area and again these objects were hovering swaying back and forth one
darted to the Northeast moving towards Rexford only 9 miles away then stopped
they actually chased it in in their car for a short distance but it went out of their jurisdiction area so they stopped
and watched it for several hours as it was joined by four to eight smaller
objects and as Dennis Brown says the
smaller lights moved from the West to the East and back again sometimes moving from one horizon to the other in less
than 5 seconds and they noticed something very interesting and I think significant ific these objects were
flying in very strange patterns making what looked like geometric shapes circles and squares they would scatter
and then group up together again now while they were all watching this the police
station uh back in the city of Colby was ringing off the hook the phone calls
were coming in like mad and in fact there was
36 calls which came into the station one farmer said that one of these objects
actually dropped from the sky and hovered no more than 3 feet above his
barn now the next morning John Culkin who was back in Jem inspected the quat
building where he had seen this UFO apparently land on top of but he found no evidence of any kind the next morning
officers Carter and brown examined the field where Paul Carter had seen this
object hovering or Landing they found no evidence there either of course
afterwards Dennis Brown was very excited to develop his pictures but was very
disappointed to find that they didn't show anything he had taken a number of pictures now one did show a white light
but he said it was just unclear wouldn't convince any Skeptics but almost all of
them were blank which made no no sense to them they felt almost as if they had been somehow not so much tampered with
but the UFO wouldn't let them take pictures but it was absolutely an event
which changed their minds about UFOs forever and as patrolman Paul Carter
says and I quote you'd think we were Maniacs except for all the people who
saw this it's true that's all I can say about it I wouldn't be making an ass out
of my myself if it wasn't what an amazing series of events it's really
unfortunate the photographs didn't come out in that case CU that really would have cemented it into UFO history but
the best evidence for that case I think is the huge number of witnesses I mean how many police officers have to see
UFOs for people to say okay there is something to this so I'm really glad
that these Witnesses came forward most don't don't especially if you've got a
career that you know your reputation might become tarnished by stepping forward but they did and I think it was
because there were so many of them seeing UFOs on that night and now we move to the next case
I'd like to cover which is a little bit different from the previous three we've been talking about I call this one
missing time in Prince George this occurred on January 5 1977 of course in
Prince George which is located in British Columbia Canada this case involves two primary
Witnesses who were driving along a lonely Highway out in the
country and they don't know each other but they came together and both experienced this really quite unusual
missing time event and a very closeup UFO sighting and one of them the primary
witness this turned out to be the first of many encounters and this is a case
with physical evidence as well including electromagnetic effects uh physiological
evidence and of course multiple Witnesses this case was investigated
numerous times by different researchers and again involves a very unusual
missing time UFO encounter the primary witness is a young 17-year-old gentleman
by the name of Kirk allore and it was around 410 a.m. on
January 5 1977 and he was driving his 1977 GMC
pickup along a straight stretch of the Yello Head Highway Highway 16 about 30
miles outside of the city of Prince George so 1410 a.m. he hadn't passed
pass a single car when he finally did see another oncoming car ahead of him
about a half mile away and it was at this exact time he saw something else a
glowing red object hovering over some power lines up ahead and as Kirk allore
says in his own words I noticed this red light move and as I watched it just shot
right over the top of the car that was coming towards me I stared at it in
amazement as if I had the urge to look at it then it just shot towards me at
the time the oncoming car was about 300 yard away if that it just shot towards
me it was huge it took up about two Highway widths and it just came right
towards me so this object was the strangest looking craft Kirk had ever seen
it almost looked he said like an octopus or a strange creature coming at him and
again I will just let him describe this in his own words and he gives a very Vivid description says Kirk to me it
looked like a giant lizard with wings and it was a little over one and a half times the size of the road width it was
sort of oblong the outer shell looked like alligator skin because of the
texture the ripples in it and the color was dull somewhat like alligator skin
there was no definite glow it had little protruding Wings except they were more
rounded underneath it had a circular thing moving like an electric razor a
disc turning inside the other it had a dome on top and that's where the light
was coming from it had all different colored lights inside of it like green
red yellow blue sort of little dots I noticed that they were constantly
changing back and forth one would go one way while inside there would be one
going the other way I just stared at that thing for the longest time when it was over top of the oncoming car and I
noticed everything in great detail I don't think it was like
anything we could build that's how strange it looked and that's what scared me it didn't look like anything I had
seen before for except maybe the lizard part that's the only thing I could
relate it to so when this craft zoomed towards them and got real close a red light came
from the Dome of the craft and lit up the entire interior of his car at this
point Kirk was in a state of total panic and he noticed that the radio in his car
which was on started to fail the transmission sort of started becoming
crackling and it just wasn't working the headlights went out and the car engine
failed as Kirk says I noticed that I had no engine power left there was just
nothing there everything locked up power steering so the motor must have died I
got strange Sensations such as my arms or legs falling asleep like pins and
needles then I swerved and missed this thing for it was coming right for me and
it all happened so fast I don't remember anything after that I sort of knocked
out I sort of blacked out I guess I felt as if there were a bunch of pins in me
and then I just sort of went into nothing the last thing I remember was my
motor dying my radio going funny and seeing this guy not more than a 100
yards away from and heading straight for me I was going at least 70 miles miles
hour I remember putting my foot on the break now Kirk had never fainted before
in his life so this was new to him but the next thing Kirk knew the guy from
the oncoming car was opening his car door on the passenger side Kirk was not
in his driver's seat anymore he was sitting in the passenger seat and this guy from the oncoming car was shaking
him and asked him are you all right Kirk said
yeah I guess so I'm okay but he really wasn't because as Kirk says I was sort
of sick at the moment I felt like I had been looked over I was aching all over
my arms everything was sore really aching I achd all over for a few
days now Kirk saw by his watch and the other man's watch that about 15 minutes
had elapsed so they had both been apparently unconscious for for that length of time and it was weird because
their cars were now 2 ft apart the other witness was driving a
1974 75 Pontiac L man but it looked to both of them as though they had missed
having a head on collision by me mere inches and in fact the other witness
told Kirk and I quote the strangest thing happened to me I came to standing
outside of my car and he began to explain to Kirk that he had seen this
unexplained red light in his rear view mirror saw it moving towards his car and
when it did like Kirk he got these prickly feelings all over his body and
the last thing he remembered seeing was Kirk's car zooming towards him and he
like Kirk passed out so Kirk was amazed as he says as for me I was in the
passenger seat when he shook me we could find no skid marks I was doing at least
70 M hour when I swered into his Lane and there were no skid marks so both Kirk and the other witness
for some reason he never got his name uh they went straight to the hospital in
vanderhof and were examined by doctors who found nothing wrong with
them so once he got home he did report his case and reporters and investigators
converged he says he took a polygraph test one of the reporters asked him
to and then he started talking to investigators and they called up the hospital and were unable to confirm his
visit with the hospital staff but they did talk to Kirk's parents who said that
yes Kirk had in fact called them from the hospital and Kirk told them that the
doctors had refused to take his report seriously which is what Kirk said they just kind of laughed at him following
this sighting Kirk said he had nightmares but he didn't want to talk to investigators and tell them what these
nightmares were about but he says he also suffered from headaches for a few days and not only that the battery of
his pickup truck which he had purchased not that long ago was nearly dead he
also said that his watch stopped working it kept stopping following the
incident and it was not long after that he started to see more UFOs one dropped
down near his house in May of 1977 and this time was viewed by his
family and his neighbors and it was just a few months
later at 11:25 p.m. on November 3rd
1977 perk who's now 18 was walking with his girlfriend Mary
Anne Samson along Old parents Beach Road on the South Shore of Stewart Lake when
they both saw a glowing red Sphere not far away now Kirk remembering his previous
encounters began to freak out but Maran was curious so she convinced him to
approach this object along with her and they got close and they could see that
it was an object about the size of a small car was giving off blue Sparks and
they approached to about 300 ft when they felt this weird force field
actually stopped them and that scared them so they ran back to their car and drove off only to find that this object
was now following them and in fact for one and a half hours it followed them
not only following them but playing this sort of cat and mouse game suddenly appearing in the middle of the road when
they would come around a corner at one point Kirk pulled a U-turn to get away
from this object and kept going and the object was there again in front of them
it paced them at Treetop level it crossed the road in front of them they were freaking out so finally they just
pulled over into a farmhouse and called the police and the police came and
investigated and they could smell this weird electrical odor where this object had been and it was following this
encounter that both Kirk and Maryanne began having strange dreams about the
incident at least one of which they said was the same exact dream and once again
they refused to elaborate on this to investigators but I suspect it involved
perhaps an onboard encounter that's pure speculation I don't know uh but it's not
unusual for someone to have dreams about an on on board experience that they
don't remember that is shrouded in missing time who knows but the UFOs weren't over
yet in January of 1968 in January of
1978 the UFO returned and paced Kirk and Mary Anne again in their car so since
his initial encounter he had a total of four other sightings and it's a kind of a joke in
its family they're always asking if he's seen any UFOs but he frankly does not like to talk about them because the
whole subject still frightens him he had never believed in UFOs but as he says I
do now I didn't before but I do now you can see how profoundly the witness was
affected in this case and I think that's probably the rule rather than the acception particularly when someone has
a missing time encounter which as I'm sure you know it's probably an onboard
encounter but you know this is something that people deal with their entire lives
many people do have a singular you know a single UFO encounter but if it's a
missing time encounter more than likely this is going to be something that's ongoing and that's certainly true in
Kirk Alor case but a really amazing case with quite a bit of evidence and again
multiple Witnesses and now we move to the next case one of the most interesting I think
in this little collection I call this one the Greenfield UFO landing this is a
really amazing case which occurred on November 8 1975 in Greenfield
Indiana and this case came to attention because these two sisters had a very
close-up encounter on their farm and app parent Landing and they wanted answers so they went
really public with their encounter and it led to a lot of
publicity and their case was very extensively researched it turned out it
was not a single event all kinds of UFO activity was
going around in that area at that time it created quite a
controversy and it's just a super fascinating and well verified case
with some incredible Landing trace evidence so this is the fifth and final
case in this collection and it was somewhere around 700 p.m. again on
November 8th 1975 when Kathy Wilfong who's 23 years
old and her sister Cindy Bridges who's 21 years old were at their
farmouse which is located somewhere between 300 and 400 North and 525 5 East
in Greenfield Indiana and it was again at 7:00 p.m. when the electricity in The Farmhouse
suddenly went out the Two Sisters lived on separate houses on the farm they have
a total of three kids together but they were together at the time Kathy's husband was away on a business trip in
Alabama so they decided to go out and check the circuit breaker which went off
so they put it back on but it went off again and in fact this happened four or
five times over a period of 15 or 20 minutes as Kathy says we just couldn't
keep the lights lit so it was around 7:30 or so when
these unexplained electrical malfunctions finally stopped and they thought that was the end of it but
unknown to them it was just the beginning and it was 2 hours later
around 9900 p.m. Cindy went outside and got into the camper trailer because as
she says I needed the headlights to see to get some firewood out of the
barn and this is when she noticed some quote pulsating lights coming from their
soybean field to the north and she instantly realized that she was seeing
something quite large very unusual and she honked the car horn to attract her
sister so Kathy her sister knew something was wrong when she heard her sister screaming also their little dog
babe was barking out of control so Kathy ran outside and saw this huge object
covered with strange lights she could see her sister in the camper and Kathy
immediately ran back inside and called the sheriff's department first and then
called her mother she told the police would you please send someone out here
in a hurry there's a UFO out here so that took her just about 1 minute and
then she ran back outside and Cindy who estimates that she
stayed in the truck about 4 minutes finally worked up the nerve to get out
she exited the truck and was running back to the house when Kathy was coming
out so Kathy went looking into the garage for the camera but it turned out
her husband and taken it so they couldn't take any pictures of this but together the two of them watched this
craft hovering just above the ground for about 12 or 15
minutes and both of them decided to retreat inside and watched as this craft rose
upward and stayed there it was not moving off it was moving off a little bit but was still visible in the area
and it was huge they described this craft as quote bigger than the barn
which was 100 ft long they said it was shaped like an upside down bowl and the
whole time they watched it it was tilted at an angle kind of showing its Underside they could see two white
lights on one end and a red light on the other with a red circle in the center
and they drew it as you can see and as Cindy says I never saw it on the ground
it was about 60 ft up in the air when I seen it just hovering there over the field I thought at first an airplane had
crashed it was so big but then I realized there was no sound and I saw that it was a UFO I started honking for
Kathy to come out and yelling UFO UFO it looked like it was in three
sections like a rectangle and the two n sections were pointed down at the ground
at a 20° angle and in the middle section there was some type of round circle
we couldn't tell if the circle was even with it or protruding out from it or up into it there was just definitely a
round circle in it the craft was a grayish green color it had two white lights on it one red
and the lights never started pulsating until it was moving and then it was moving the lights
started never blinking off but got brighter and dimmer it was just so huge
and it didn't make a noise and that's what scared me the thing moved like it was in slow
motion so Kathy verifies all of this as she says when I saw this thing all this
light I panicked I ran into the house called the sheriff's department then I called our mother I ran outside left my
mother hanging on the phone when I did talk with my mother I just kept yelling
UFO UFO so meanwhile back at the Sheriff's
Office calls were flooding in from all over the county reporting UFOs one man said he was driving along
Interstate 70 and saw what he thought were several helicopters flying low over his car
another woman in McCordsville said that she saw unexplained lights Kathy and Cindy's mother who
lived about six miles away arrived shortly later and she actually saw the
lights from this object as she approached but by the time she got at the farm the lights were pretty much off
in the distance but still clearly visible and it was a short time later
that the two deputies from the Sheriff's Office showed up at the wilfong's
residence now the sisters say it was a half an hour after they called however
there's some dispute about this and in fact Sheriff Malcolm gross denied this
he said that the will Fong's call came at 902 that the deputies arrived at
908 however the farm is 8 miles from the sheriff's office so how they could get
there in 6 minutes well either way by this time the lights were further off in
the distance but still clearly visible and both deputies could see it and they
told the sisters that is a hell helicopter and Kathy and Cindy said no
no no this is not a helicopter we saw it close up it was 120 ft long it had no
normal navigation lights and it was totally silent and one of the deputies turned to
Kathy and mocked her and and said do you space talk in fact he told her that she
watched too much Mor and Mindy and asked her if they they'd been drinking or smoking or taking
pills which really made her angry and she told him that she says hey I don't
need this I've just seen something that terrified me I do admit that the other
Deputy was more respectful and questioned them in quote a very sincere
manner but both seemed quite skeptical and uh still the officers did
question them and then left and the will pongs had no answer to what they
saw uh and in total this craft was visible for about 40 minutes they
estimate and it was the next morning Cindy went out into the soybean field
and this is when she saw that there was this huge perfect circle of crushed
vegetation and not just crushed but matted and woven together in this very strange
pattern and I'll just quote Kathy Direct L as she says in her own words we didn't
know how large it was at first we found out later it was 44 F feet in diameter
and it was a perfect circle and the weeds and everything were smashed down but not to the ground they
were like 6 to 8 in above the ground and they were intertwined together so much
that if you tried to pick it up the whole thing would come up with it and in
fact during an interview on a television station she did try to pick up this
vegetation and you could see the whole thing coming up with it now before the object had apparently
landed there or affected the vegetation the plants were about 5T
high and Kathy and Cindy tried to get help tried to get people interested but
nobody seemed to want to hear it they called the police again and showed them
The Landing marks and the police first said well helicopters probably did it which again
the sisters denied and then they actually accused the sisters of mashing
down the plants themselves so this case was now generating a lot of publicity because
the sisters were granting interviews to newspaper reporters and television reporters and talking about how they
were being mistreated by the Sheriff's Department and this is when Sheriff Malcolm e grass
wrote a letter to the Greenfield Indiana reporter this was published on November
29th and he wrote and I quote I don't know what Miss Wilfong and Miss Bridges
saw November 8 no one on the Hancock County Sheriff's department has had
specific training in this area we have to rely on the sources available to us I
hope the experts from the center of UFO studies can help identify what they saw
the Hancock County Sheriff's Department did respond quickly in six minutes to
miss Will Fong's call several calls were made to obtain as much information as
possible I hope if anyone sees anything they will not hesitate to contact the
sheriff's department and we will do everything we can to assist them sincerely Malcolm grass Sheriff of
Hancock County so uh these sisters did call the
center for UFO studies which came out and started doing a fullon
investigation but they had a real hard time trying to get people to take this seriously as Kathy says we were
horrified we called everyone we knew but nobody would listen something that close
that huge it's just unb believable and they did receive a lot of
skepticism from people who said that they probably saw helicopters but they both disagree as
Kathy says we see helicopters out here all the time they fly along the power
lines and you can always hear them coming before you ever see them but there just wasn't any noise this time if
we hadn't gone outside we wouldn't have known anything was there
so they called up the center for UFO studies qos and investigators Alan Henry
and Paul Clark showed up at the farm interviewed the witnesses examined the
landing traces and began a whole investigation and they learned that there were no less
than 19 separate reports of strange lights in the Green Field area alone on
that night they contacted various airports and so forth the spokesperson for the
National Guard and Army Reserve helicopter fields near Shelbyville and
McCordsville said that they had no helicopters in the Greenfield area on
that night so finally qos released a statement which said in part this case
has been extremely puzzling as many as 15 separate Witnesses in the area have
been interviewed we are trying to identify the object then they said that
they were still analyzing the soil samples so couldn't comment on that but
again Kathy did interviews for both newspaper and television shows both of
the sisters did because they wanted others to know that they had seen something and they suspected other
people had seen it too as Kathy says and I quote maybe others saw the same thing
or maybe someone has found a saucer nest and didn't know what it was if so and if
they come forward and say something about it then that makes it
worthwhile and apparently it was worthwhile because after the Articles and news reports came out a whole bunch
of other people came forward and said they saw strange lights in the area on that night but ultimately the whole
experience left both the sisters badly Shook Up as Kathy says I keep the drapes pinned
shut on the west Windows anyway I was too petrified by the whole experience if
it comes back I want to be the first one to see it not have it out there seeing
me and this was not an isolated sighting there were several other very high
quality reports both in the days and weeks before the sister sighting and
after so apparently the UFOs were very interested for some reason in this area
I think you'll agree that's an undeniable case here we have Landing traces they observed this UFO very close
up for quite a long period of time and with so many other people in the area
reporting their encounters I mean how do you deny something like this and it's super
interesting to me that as soon as they really went public and articles and news
stories on television started appearing a whole new batch of witnesses came forward and this just speaks to the fact
that most people don't step forward and talk about their encounters thankfully times are changing this subject is going
mainstream the ridicule and disbelief is falling to the Wayside to a certain
extent we still have more work to do but progress has definitely been made thanks
to the witnesses who are stepping forward so these five cases as I'm sure
you know are not even 0.001% of the true number of cases and
just represent the tiny tip of the iceberg of what's going on but even
alone these five cases as I said in the beginning provide enough evidence I
think undeniable evidence to say that there is reality to the UFO phenomena so
don't tell me there's no evidence there is and there's a lot of it and that's why I wanted to do this episode for you
today so I hope you've enjoyed it perhaps learned a little bit I really
want to thank you once again for watching it's always appreciated until next time keep searching for the truth
keep asking those hard questions most important of all keep having fun until
next time bye.
