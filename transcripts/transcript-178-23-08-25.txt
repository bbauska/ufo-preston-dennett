ELF OR ALIEN? TEN TRUE CASES
Aug 25, 2023

Summary:
Aug 25, 2023
One puzzling enigma of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Blue Beings…the list is endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world report many supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes…little people of all kinds. Could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are many reports like this, and it's still going on today! This video presents ten cases of people who have encountered little people which might be either an elf or alien!

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a lady was picking berries in the forest near her home in when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing nearby was an elf-like creature holding an axe. The woman fled the area. She returned later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when one afternoon, he heard someone tapping on the window. He was amazed to see a tiny man only with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man had large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark pants and leather shoes. He introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared many times, shared special stories with him and performed playful antics to make Galen laugh.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. On Christmas morning in 1957, a seven-year-old boy woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed. He wanted to jump up and investigate but couldn't move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. One cold morning in 1976 a lady exited her home in Appleby, TX. To her shock, a tall, winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin sat on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange, burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about 20 feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap. Turning, he saw a short, fat, dwarf with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. He wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. Two weeks earlier, a family in the area saw the same figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. One summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal when he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the ET presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
this episode is a little bit different from anything I've ever done I call this one Elf 
or alien people of course have been seeing humanoids of all kinds for a very long time and 
we're talking very tall humanoids short humanoids really every shape size and color you can imagine 
and I think the most popular explanation for these humanoids is extraterrestrials but that might not 
be true in every case in fact in these cases I think there might very well be another explanation 
these are cases involving what appear to be little people who are native to our planet 
and if you examine the cultures across the world pretty much all of them have a long history of 
strange supernatural creatures call them what you will elves dwarves leprechauns Cobalts fairies 
pretty much every location on this planet as reports of these little people this is often 
thought to be mythological but if you look into the actual reports they're really quite compelling 
and they haven't gone away there are in fact many modern cases and that's what I'd really like to 
talk about today I investigated with my own cases that's what inspired me to take a little bit of a 
deeper look into this I was really quite surprised to find so many cases of these elves or perhaps 
ETS I don't know there's a little bit of bleed through in some of these cases you can make up 
your own mind about them but I can tell you again they do come from all over the world 
many of them are involving multiple Witnesses some do have physical evidence there does 
seem to be a direct UFO Association in some of them certainly not all of them but I've got 10 
cases that I found particularly compelling including one I investigated personally 
and that is what I would like to cover today so there's quite a bit of cases let's just get 
started and the first case I'd like to present I call an elf in Bronte Finland 
this is a very early case way back in 1885 which as it turns out does seem to involve a landed UFO 
this case actually comes from Albert Rosales and his amazing multi-volume books humanoids Among 
Us it's a pretty interesting account again this occurred in 1885 in Bronte Finland this is near 
the city of kamito and it involves a young woman a mother of three children who was picking berries 
in the forest when she came upon something that shouldn't be there she said it resembled a kettle 
lock as you can see pictured here and it was sort of parked there on a small hill but besides this 
large object stood in elf-like creature that she said was carrying something that resembled an ax 
on his shoulder now this quite frightened her and she returned to her Village and after a couple of 
hours she went back to the location this time with other villagers but the object and the elf were 
gone so she told this to her grandmother who is 71 years old and related this story which originally 
comes from researcher Murphy vertanen of Finland it's an amazing case so yeah I mean that sounds 
like a classic little elf however given that there was apparently a landed UFO of some size 
I don't know I honestly don't know there's so many cases that sort of raise these very serious 
questions about who and what these beings are and here's another one which I call the little 
man of mangup New York this is another really interesting case which took place way back in 1947 
it involves a junction by the name of Ron Quinn who published his account in fate magazine and 
it's quite a detailed story and I don't know sounds like a elf to me I love this case August 
1947 was really about let's see one month after the Roswell UFO crash probably just a coincidence 
but at any rate the main witness is Ron Quinn and this took place again in mangap Valley in New York 
this is east of Monticello and it was August of 1942 when Ron Quinn who was 10 years old was 
with his family on vacation in the country they had spent most of the day outside but Ron got in 
trouble and was told to spend in our inside the cottage while the others remained outside to play 
so he was inside when he heard a soft tapping noise on the window 
and I'll just let Ron say what happened in his own words because he describes it very well 
as Ron says I looked in the direction of the sound and froze in fear 
standing on the outside of the window ledge was a small oddly dressed man about 12 inches high 
the little fellow did not entirely resemble the traditional elf gnome or leprechaun we have all 
seen depicted in various books and movies after all these years I can still describe 
that little man down to the Last Detail as His Image is branded deep in my memory 
he had an odd looking hat dark green in color a short dark gray beard covered his lower face 
from beneath his hat silky curly hair cascaded down and covered his ears which I never saw 
his light gray shirt fits somewhat tightly around his upper body but the sleeves were quite baggy 
the little guy's trousers were the same color and ended below the knee something resembling a black belt encircled his wide waist but it had no buckle you are dark 
brown soft looking boots that ended just below the trousers is extremely large eyes were his 
most striking feature in the expression on his little face was that of pure friendship and love 
so this is quite a striking thing for Iran to see and despite this tiny man's friendly appearance 
he became terrified because even at age 10 he knew that such things were not supposed to exist 
so he looked away hoping that this was an illusion that would disappear but of course the knocking sound came again Ron looked back and the men smiled and waved his hand at him 
and at this point he noticed that this little man held a small walking stick and it was he was using 
this little stick to tap the window so Ron could hardly believe his eyes but it was clear that this 
figure was no illusion and as he says what I was looking upon was real in every sense of the word 
including the movement of his body in the shadow he cast on the ledge below everything was there 
so at this point this little figure motioned for Ron to come closer and after a moment Ron gathered 
his courage he knelt forward and slowly opened the window and this little man eyed him closely and as 
Ron says he kept smiling and looking me over as if he had never been this close to a human before 
as I reached out to touch this strange individual that had invaded my life he stepped back and his head tilted from left to right as he inspected me from every angle 
after smiling once more the little guy leaped from the ledge Landing gracefully on the grass below 
he ran with long leaps across the lawn stopping momentarily to look back and disappeared among the Shadows of the trees 
so Ron was amazed and he jumped up and told his family but to his disappointment nobody believed 
him even after he showed them a clear footprint on the grass made by this little man he told his 
friends and they teased him mercilessly however even today Ron is still sticking to his story 
as he says in all this time that one experience remains high on my list of pleasant memories 
I've told this story numerous times at parties and so on and have received various explanations 
to this day I am certain that the little character was real and not something conceived 
in the mind of a young man with a quote very active imagination as mom had put it 
now one perhaps really telling detail was mentioned by Ron who said quote the most 
striking feature was his extremely large eyes this is a comment often made by people who encountered 
ETS but otherwise I mean this does not sound like an ET so that's the little man of mangap New York 
and as you can see it inspired Ron Quinn to actually write a entire book about little people 
uh this is far more common I think than most people realize it just doesn't get a whole lot of 
attention these are definitely still going on as we see we're going sort of chronologically through 
these stories there are some very much current stories but here's another one which I personally 
investigated I call this one my mysterious friend this is actually the title that the witness gave 
himself to his account and wow what an interesting story because he not only saw this little elf-like 
creature once or twice about multiple times this one occurred in Lakewood Colorado in 1945 when the 
main witness was just a tiny little boy himself but again as we shall see it affected him for the 
rest of his life so it was 1945 and Galen sharp was in his home in Lakewood Colorado he was only 
four years old when he first met his little elf at least that's what he thought it was as Galen says 
he just stepped out of the bookcase that stood against the wall he was just as tall 
as I if not a little taller his head and head and eyes were large but normal looking 
In My Memory he looked like I would have called an elf had I known what an elf was then he was not 
at all scary or threatening though he was small he didn't look like a child and was as solid and real 
as anyone he was wearing a little short jacket and dark square cut pants with worn leather shoes 
his nose was round he wore no cap or hat and was bald his movements were quick and deliberate 
so Galen did have siblings he had many friends he had great parents who were very loving and 
nurturing he was a very happy child and now seeing this elf-like being he was even more 
delighted especially when this elf began to speak to him and share special stories with him 
and in fact as Galen says he told me about many wondrous things 
but being only four I couldn't understand most of the things he told me however he was friendly and 
helpful and could really make me laugh now the elf did share his name with Galen this is a name which 
Galen has chosen to keep private but the elf did call Galen by his own nickname topper which Galen 
had earned due to his very fine blonde hair which had a tendency to kind of float around his head 
so after a short little introduction this little man just disappeared Galen of course quickly ran 
to his mother and excitedly told her about his new friend and after listening to what 
he had to say Halen's mother just kind of smiled and said that he had quote an imaginary friend 
so this really puzzled Galen Z says I didn't know what the word imaginary meant at that time so I 
still considered him very real so time moved on and Galen wasn't really expecting another visit 
but he got one it was just a short time later when his elf friend appeared again 
as before the visit was very short the elf appeared kind of joked and played around with 
Galen for a few minutes and then disappeared as mysteriously as he had arrived once again 
he tried to tell his parents but he was unable to convince them that his elf friend was real
as Galen says my parents were not concerned and didn't seem interested in my friend I guess the 
word imaginary took all the reality out of it for them they seemed amused but not curious at all and 
never asked about it so this was having a huge effect on Galen and over the next year this elf 
appeared at least three more times the visits were few and somewhat far between they occurred without 
any warning but it was always the same sort of thing this little elf-like creature looked very 
solid and real always wore the same strange outfit and was always very happy and jolly as Galen says 
I really didn't see him very often maybe only five times possibly more but certainly not every day 
he was not a constant companion and you would always show up unexpectedly although only when 
I was alone and never at night but I was always glad to see him we would play together and talk 
about interesting things joke and laugh once in the yard he put a bushel basket on his head 
and clowned around while I laughed myself silly so there was one curious feature that Galen did 
notice was that this elf although clearly solid as he would often grab objects and move them around 
he never actually touched Galen himself as Galen says he did touch and handle things yet I can't 
recall him ever touching me we mostly talked about things I knew so little about the world that I 
didn't question his sudden appearances in my home he seemed to know all about me and everything else 
there was one very special visitation in which galen's little elf friend actually brought 
along another elf as Galen says one of the most remarkable memories with him was meeting another 
elf like him just outside the back door of our garage the new elf was possibly taller a little 
older and dressed much like my friend they told me about exciting things to come I was amazed and 
astounded with all they told me I remember the time vividly even how and where we were standing 
and then came bad news galen's family had decided to move Galen was not happy about it because he was afraid his elf friend wouldn't be able to follow him 
so next time the elf appeared Galen vowed to ask if the elf would follow 
and sure enough a short time later this elf did show up again unannounced by this time again was 
five years old and after some joking around Galen shared the sad news as Galen says in his own words 
I told him we were going to move to another house far away and asked him to come with us 
he explained that he had to stay there and couldn't move away I was heartbroken I cried 
and I pleaded with him to come but he was adamant he couldn't leave that area so Galen 
was devastated and they moved to another area and of course that was the last of it Galen never saw 
this elf again but did have a profound effect on his life and he is certain that this elf was not 
an imaginary friend and was absolutely real as he says I had no good reason for an imaginary friend 
if he actually was imaginary then I may be the only child who ever got dumped by his imaginary 
friend I know it wasn't pretending or fantasizing because looking back I had no control over it take 
for instance his refusal to come with me I don't think we even said goodbye my own assessment of 
this experience is that it really happened however I believe that it had a positive healthy effect on 
my life unfortunately I don't remember any of the stories they told me yet since that experience I 
have been a lifelong seeker of spiritual truth and in 2012 I wrote a book that was the culmination 
of what I called my quote intuitive research so the title of that book is what am I a study of 
non-volitional living it was very well received and followed up with a number of other books 
all about spirituality and enlightenment so galen's early childhood visitations 
really had a long effect on his life and growing up he heard about Grays and ET abductions and 
wondered briefly it could have been something like that but he immediately dismissed that 
because as he says this elf was quote not like the Grays we know of from abduction stories I 
have no memory of anything like an abduction or examination and don't think those happened 
I think back on the experience as a learning time and was always happy to see him and listen to him 
so Galen doesn't know what to make of this was this an elf you know a leprechaun a gnome 
he he can only say what happened to him as he says this little person could be from another 
dimension or interdimensional since it didn't fit the ET profile I have always followed my 
sense of wonder and all of my books are spiritual my friend told me wonderful and amazing things but 
I don't remember them maybe they were spiritual things and it has been coming out in my books 
maybe someday I will learn about the reality of my old friend whether Elf or angel or just 
who and what he was or is I have never heard of this happening to anyone else quite this way and 
I wonder if anyone hearing this might have had a similar experience and can shed some light on who 
or what was this wonderful mysterious visitor of my childhood so Galen did have a number of really 
spiritual and paranormal experiences and at least at four UFO sightings which you can read about in 
my book humanoids and high strangeness I have to leave a little bit of a teaser for you guys but 
yeah what an amazing account that is so yeah that case I did publish in my latest book humanoids 
and high strangeness and it is definitely High strangeness in fact that's why Galen contacted me 
he wanted to know if I'd ever heard of or received a report like his and again that's what prompted 
me to sort of take a deeper look into cases like these and I was surprised to find quite a few 
so this yeah really makes me wonder about some of these reports of elves and berries and gnomes 
and here's another one that I found in Whitley streeper's book the communion letters which seems 
to involve probably an alien I don't know I call this one the alien elf of San Gabriel California 
and again the witness in this case was a little boy from San Gabriel California who had a very 
unusual encounter with a little person it was Christmas morning of 1957 when a seven-year-old 
child from San Gabriel California had an experienced what he thought first was an elf 
as he wrote in a letter to Whitley streber quote it must have been between 2 or 3 am 
and I was lying in bed in my bedroom I remember I awakened rather suddenly and was quite unable to 
move seemingly Frozen in bed the witness who is anonymous although he was unable to move 
could see out the bedroom across the living room and onto the front porch and that's when 
things became strange because as he says on the porch seemingly peering into the living room was 
a smallish creature I remember thinking to be one of Santa's elves I was naturally excited 
and wanted to get up to meet or see this elf much closer I remember being wide awake 
and desperately wanting to get up but patently unable to accomplish this seemingly simple task 
he seemed to be about three or four feet tall and was cream in color 
I saw more of a three-quarter profile and could not make much of any other distinguishing features 
I was not that fearful just excited and burning with curiosity my frustration was building with 
my seeming inability to rise from bed I then had a firm sense of it's okay now just go back to sleep 
it had a parental tone to it loving yet directive however not either of my parents voices 
so the witness fell back asleep however this experience was not forgotten because as he says 
on Christmas morning as my sister was going nuts I was relatively disinterested in all the stuff around the tree instead I was determined to 
go out onto the front porch and check for evidence of what I knew was there 
unfortunately there was no evidence nevertheless the witness still remembers that quote my parents 
were rather dumbfounded dumbfounded at my spurning Christmas presence in favor of running outside 
now later this witness would have further UFO experiences which seems to confirm the 
validity of this Christmas Day visitation and really point to the E.T interpretation 
I wish I had more information on this case because I suspect he probably did have later encounters 
with ETS which would point to this being a fairly standard extraterrestrial encounter hard to say 
without more information but it definitely fits in with this compilation of strange little people and 
here's another one which is exceedingly strange I call this one the fairy elf of Appleby Texas 
and this involves what looks like an a fairy or an elf in that is wearing the kind of clothes we 
see reported in these cases but has wings so I mean make of it what you will it appears to 
be an absolutely serious report this is not so much a little person as it is described being 
quite tall but it's also a fairly recent we're talking 1976. another indication that this is 
still going on all over the world it was a cold winter morning around 6 a.m in October of 1976. 
and the witness lived on 30 Acres of forest and Hills alone in Appleby Texas 
and she had stepped outside to burn some trash and was surprised at what she saw a 
strange being with wings was sitting on a bench in her flower garden watching her with interest 
and she said that this figure was actually pretty tall and really strongly built 
it was all grain color Wings skin all of it though it did have solid black eyes 
to the point where she couldn't see any actual pupil just pure black eyes didn't appear to be 
a man or woman kind of genderless and wasn't wearing any clothes as far as she could tell 
but it had this weird way of moving around that reminded her more of an animal than a human 
she described this as being very much like a bird jerks its head around in quick movements 
but she says it did have long white straight hair which actually reached 
down to the middle of its back it did have pointed ears pointed backwards like an elf 
and it was letting out a series of strange hums when it opened its mouth 
she said it almost sounded like it was singing to her or making some kind of a call 
and apparently saw her because she said it seemed to smile at her at which point everything got 
blindingly bright so bright that the witness had to cover her eyes and face and she could actually 
feel heat coming from this light and when the light and the heat died out she looked where this 
fairy or else or this creature had been but all she saw was this sort of burned spot on the bench 
and a closer inspection of this bench revealed that it had to have been heated up at a very high 
temperature because it was burned and crumbling at the spot where she had seen this strange 
being I think you'll agree that's an absolutely fascinating case which was posted on a paranormal 
form on the internet and really just bizarre I mean I don't know how else to describe it 
and if it were just a one-off I'd be more inclined to dismiss it but as we've seen it's not a lot of 
people are reporting these supernatural creatures more natural I'm getting to wonder if these are 
just sort of interdimensional beings because they sort of appear and disappear but they are 
all over the world and there's many recent cases and here's another one from 1986 and I call this 
one The Gnome of Santa Clara County Colorado this is a really unusual case it's quite brief but I 
think definitely worth mentioning because again it fits right in with these kinds of stories 
of little people this case is quite brief but really interesting and again pretty recent 1986 
uh this occurred in Santa Clara County but more specifically in the city of walsenberg 
and it was around 4 P.M one afternoon in 1986 and the main witness who is anonymous was digging out 
a tree just a few miles west of town and reported seeing this little figure a man about nine inches 
tall and he watched it for several minutes from a pretty close vantage point he estimates that 
he was about 20 feet away and looking at this little man he could see that it was dressed in 
a one-piece Brown garment now Look to Him like it was made out of leather and he said this little 
being was wearing loose ankle length foot gear and what he could only call a quote Robin Hood 
sort of cone-shaped hat and this little man was standing directly beneath a pinion tree 
and he washed this little guy for about 10 minutes until suddenly without warning ran off through the 
brush he said as quick as a rabbit this happened when a co-worker called out to the witness 
so yeah a pretty close-up encounter with one of these little people there you go another little 
dwarf or Elf or call it what you will but it's wearing what looked like kind of normal clothes 
with the little Robin Hood hat and the whole deal this was posted on a Bigfoot Forum actually you'll 
find these reports all over the place people aren't quite sure where to report them so if 
you dig deep you'll find that there's quite a lot of them and it really surprises me how current 
some of these cases are because here's another one from 1989 and I call this one a tiny dwarf 
and Rock Creek County Colorado this is another Colorado case so that's kind of interesting 
Colorado does have lots of water and rivers and mountains it's a beautiful state and apparently 
there are tiny little creatures roaming throughout the Wilderness this would be something to see 
and yeah this is an unusual case for sure it's amazing to me how recent these cases are because 
yeah this one occurred at 10 A.M September 6 1989 again in Rock Creek Canyon in Colorado 
and again this comes from Christopher O'Brien who wrote about it in his book enter the valley 
the main witness is Juan maestus he's a bow hunter and he was actually out hunting quietly stalking a 
herd of young elk of Hell in a wooded area when he heard this twig kind of snapping to his left side 
so he froze in his tracks expecting to see some sort of creature and he did you turn to look 
at the source of the noise and was amazed to see quote a fat ugly little guy about three feet tall 
and by coincidence I guess this fat little ugly guy turned and at the same instant and stared 
right Back At One so he was pretty close about 50 feet away and was standing next to a Tall Pine 
Tree and as one and this little man locked eyes one could see that this little man had a wrinkled 
forehead a clean shaven face and pinkish skin he was wearing what appeared to be green overalls 
with suspenders and a sort of floppy hat flat on top this little figure had reddish hair and it was 
sticking out from underneath his cap he had little eyes that almost looked reddish and bloodshot 
and this little man gave Juan a sort of smile and then suddenly darted behind the tree 
so Juan being amazed quickly ran to the spot but the little man had completely disappeared however 
Christopher O'Brien found out something very interesting he got confirmation because two weeks 
earlier in fact very close to this same location a family of five on a picnic had witnessed what 
appears to be the same or similar entity as it was also dressed in green overalls and a hat 
so yeah very strange so here we go another little being dressed in green overalls wearing a little 
hat this just does not sound like an E.T to me uh this does again come from Christopher O'Brien 
and in his book The Mysterious Valley he covers all kinds of weird reports in 
this one area there's a huge number of UFO reports here but other weird stuff as well 
so perhaps this is all part of the same phenomena in some way I don't know I tend 
to think that these are actual separate phenomena and that we do have these little critters running around who are native to our planet and have always been there 
they just haven't really reached the mainstream scientific community in terms of being accepted 
but so so so many reports that it's clear to me they're absolutely real and I honestly don't 
think they're extraterrestrials me personally I think most of these are just little people that 
we have living on our planet that we're sharing this planet with them and here's another one which 
is coincidentally in a very famous UFO location I call this one the little man of Roswell New Mexico 
and this occurred as recently as summer of 1997 and yes in Roswell or outside of the 
town but definitely this is not your standard gray UT this next case is also quite brief 
it occurred very early in the morning about 5 30 a.m on a summer morning in 1997 again outside of 
Roswell New Mexico and it comes from investigator Robert Gorman uh the witness who is anonymous had 
decided to go outside with a cup of coffee to a picnic table in her backyard and her little 
Chihuahua Bella followed her so she first thought uh that her neighbor had bought a dog 
a little Schnauzer and taking a better look she noticed it was not a dog at all but a little man 
so she and her dog both ran to the fence to get a better look and they saw that yeah it 
was a little man about 12 inches tall kind of stocky build had bushy gray eyebrows and a beard 
so your typical kind of little L for dwarf I don't know but he was wearing a gray Woolen 
shirt no buttons gray pants and for a belt he had a sort of a rope tied around his waist 
he had soft brown boots that reminded the witness more of socks than anything else 
so this actually frightened the little Chihuahua Bella who ran back into the house and under the 
bed and actually remained there for most of the day and according to this Witness the little man 
kind of had a funny walk in which he would sort of wobble from side to side and quickly ran into 
a nearby China Berry Tree and disappeared now she couldn't see a door or any entrance but she had 
the impression that this little man disappeared into the tree itself now there's a detail that 
keeps coming up in some of these little elf cases what I found interesting about this particular 
report was the elf ran to a tree and disappeared apparently inside of it that does turn up in a 
number of these cases where the beings are somehow associated with forests or trees so these are like 
the elves they live in the forest I don't know really quite surprising how many reports there 
are of these and here's one which comes from actually the black forest of Germany and I call 
this one appropriately an elf in the black forest this occurred quite recently summer of 2002 this 
was near Mitchell doll this is right in the black forest of Germany and appears to be your typical 
elf as we'll see it's definitely not your standard ET I love this case it's it's just different and 
it's quite recent summer of 2002 5 p.m this was investigated by Magnus scarf heddinson 
and uh occurred in the town of mital this is in the black forest in Germany and the main witness 
is a 34 year old German citizen by the name of heartmut Schultz and he had this experience while 
taking a Sunday drive with his girlfriend and an acquaintance so yeah it was about five o'clock 
and they were on their way home to Mitchell tall and this was just east of this tiny little village 
which is where there's a lot of lumber processing which might be significant because looking out the 
window harmut clearly saw what he believes to be an elf sitting on a pile of newly sawed wood just 
alongside the road now this was a big wood pile about five feet high and this elf was just sort 
of resting on top of it like he was enjoying a sun bath and get this was leisurely smoking a pipe 
so he Mr Schultz was in the car and was moving pretty slowly so he was able to study this elf 
figure clearly for a good time and he could see that it was wearing brown clothes and had a hat 
on its head like they often seemed to do but while his car was actually passing right by 
this elf this elf seemed to notice that he was being watched and seemed to be surprised 
and it also seemed to make him happy because this elf sprang to his feet and seemed to jump for joy 
when he apparently realized that he was being seen by another human being and he actually 
not only jumped up but started to run alongside the car which was yeah still moving quite slow 
so this little elf actually faced uh heart Mutt and who was still looking at him but 
the elf couldn't quite keep up with the car itself but the witness did get the impression 
that the elf wanted to know more about him or possibly even attempt to communicate with him 
however he was driving and left this elf standing on the side of the road kind of staring back at 
him and what's really interesting is he was not the only one who saw it Hartman's girlfriend also 
saw this elf-like creature and according to them it seemed to them that this elf was just kind of 
watching the traffic knowing that most humans were not likely able to see him but apparently 
something about heart much gave him the ability to see him perhaps he had psychic abilities this 
is what the researcher Magnus speculated anyway it's a really unusual recent case of one of these 
weird elf-like creatures so the researcher in this case yeah actually does work at an elf Museum who 
knew that there was such a thing but they've been collecting hundreds upon hundreds of these reports 
so clearly it's a lot more common than people realize which I think kind of makes sense because 
if you saw something like this who would you tell I mean even UFO researchers I think would 
be hard-pressed to accept some of these stories I think the best evidence for the veracity is 
honestly the huge number of these cases and how consistent they are in the description of these 
beings wearing these little leather suits you know coveralls overalls a little leather boots 
a belt like a rope and a little furry hat I mean this is just incredibly consistent 
and there's I mean I just kind of emphasize it enough there's so many of these cases 
and here's another one very recent 2003 and this comes from the Rough River State Park in Kentucky 
and that's what I call it the little man of Rough River State Park this is a really interesting 
account of one of these elves now I just want to present one more case the most recent one 
and this yeah occurred on June 24 2003 during the afternoon and as I said in the Rough River State 
Park in Kentucky the main witness is anonymous he had gone canoeing and it was just kind of having 
a week of resting and relaxing in an isolated Natural Area but for some reason the sense of 
nervousness and queasiness came over him he was inexplicably anxious he said and he couldn't quite 
figure out why but he felt like something bad was going to happen and taking these Sensations 
very seriously he became extremely cautious while canoeing on this River and after several miles he 
paddled the canoe to the riverbank tied it to a tree and went out to explore the area 
and looking down about eight or ten feet into the creek he saw what looked like a clay jar 
and he thought oh maybe this is some old archaeological artifact so he started to 
walk towards this object down the creek but it was extremely slippery with mud and he stopped 
just short of the water and very close to this artifact which looked like an old earthenware pot 
sort of like a clay crock pot but looking at it you could see it didn't look that old 
and so he actually walked up to it poked at it and this is when he saw a tiny little handprints on it 
and he first thought of those raccoon prints but they didn't look like it he said they looked like 
human handprints but they were only about an inch wide so he started he grabbed the stick and tried 
to pry this thing loose but this is when he heard a noise and then he heard what sounded like little 
kids laughing coming from down the creek just a short way down and he pulled this Croc jar out 
of the mud and he heard some somebody screaming he said it sounded like a little girl very high 
pitched quite loud not knowing what to do he grabs this jar and starts to scramble up the 
muddy Bank of the creek and looking back he saw something moving down towards the creek 
so he sat down and looked at the jar trying to reason the handprints walked back along the creek 
and stopping and looking peeking through the bushes to see if we could see who was out there 
then when he looked over the bank he saw them two little people standing he says under a foot 
about 10 inches tall they said they had very pale skin little brown leather pants held up 
by suspenders they were shirtless bare chested had little pointy hats made of what he believed 
to be leather as well as little leather shoes that went up past the ankle he said they had red hair 
and blue eyes but yeah tiny little hands only an inch wide so he's pretty sure that they were the 
ones who were touching this clay pot so they could see him and saw him watching him but they didn't 
really seem to mind and continued their task they were like pulling this stump down the muddy 
creek with what he believed to be long leather ropes or almost strings they looked like to him 
he says they were actually really clean considering they were working in the mud so he's watching this and then heard this thumping back where he had first gone in the creek and 
looking back he saw three more of these little guys were identical in appearance to the first two 
and they had pushed that Croc uh Clay Pot that Croc jar back down onto the creek and 
they were all laughing this really high-pitched laughter again reminding him of a bunch of kids 
at that point there was a loud snapping noise and they were all gone however he 
says their Footprints were plainly visible in the mud but they were gone and so is the 
Croc jar and the wooden stump it they had all vanished in literally a Split Second 
so there you go it leaves physical evidence Footprints and everything so this is not somebody imagining these things though these could very well be interdimensional creatures 
people have talked about how ETS might be interdimensional well I think that's kind 
of a cop-out honestly because every entity on this planet and other planets for that matter 
has interdimensional aspects I mean we have a soul we go to the other side every entity is 
interdimensional I just think that perhaps some of these have mastered the ability to move into 
the fourth or fifth Dimensions or what have you like we do see with accounts of Bigfoot 
disappearing in a Flash or just not see being seen and then not being seen so these are just 
10 cases again I did Cover one of these uh their account my mysterious friend my Galen sharp in my 
book humanoids and high strangeness because I want people to be aware that there is a lot of stuff 
going on that we still don't fully understand and that not all accounts of humanoids might 
necessarily be extraterrestrials in the classic sense and some of these that we think our elves 
might in fact be extraterrestrials I think it's a two-way street but either way these cases are 
clearly real there's so many of them that alone I think makes it important that we are aware of them 
and boy it certainly is interesting I don't know how I would react if I saw one of these little 
guys but I think it sure would be something to see well that's it for today I really want 
to thank you for watching I hope you found it interesting and maybe even learned a little bit 
and until next time I just want to say keep asking questions keep searching for 
the truth and most important just like these little people are keep having fun bye now.
