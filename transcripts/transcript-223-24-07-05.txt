Summary:
Jul 5, 2024
We all love our fur babies, and dogs are the most popular pet of all. They have been man’s best friend for countless millennia. What many people don’t know, however, is that ETs also show a great interest in canines. There has never been a study of dog-UFO cases until now! This video presents more than two dozen cases in which dogs have been directly and extensively involved with UFOs and extraterrestrials. These cases reach back to the 1940s up to the present day, and they provide some profound insights into extraterrestrials and their agenda on this planet.

These cases come from across the planet, New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Ukraine, England, Wales, Ireland, Spain, Canada, Mexico, and more, including all over the United States. A wide variety of ETs show interest in a wide variety of dogs. The cases include dogs being taken onboard and examined, and even in some cases healed. In some cases, the dogs are taken by themselves. In others, people are taken onboard with their own dogs. 

Why are ETs taking dogs onboard? What do these accounts have to tell us about extraterrestrials? The answers are in this unique episode. These cases offer a wide variety of compelling evidence including multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs of UFOs, audio recordings from firsthand witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, and of course, animal reaction cases!

With so many encounters like these, the truth cannot be denied. ETs are showing an interest in dogs. If you would like to explore more about cases like these, check out the book, “Not from Here: Volume Five,” which contains a full-length chapter with a comprehensive presentation of dog-UFO encounters.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal got a pretty
unique episode for you today I'm going to cover a topic of euphology that I don't think has ever been covered before
certainly not by me I call this one aliens abducted my dog this is actually
taken from a chapter of my new book not from here volume Five this is something
I've wanted to look into for a while because I do have a few cases of this and I took a deeper look and boy was I
shocked when I found over two dozen cases of people who have been taken on board with their dog seen dogs on board
or had their dog taken on board so these are really unusual cases from all over
the world stretching back to the 1940s all the way up to the 2010s so
quite some time and yeah all over the world all different types of ETs a lot
of really interesting compelling evidence certainly some multiple witness cases but a lot of them so this is going
to be a somewhat long episode forgive me if I talk quickly because I want to present as much information as possible
these cases are really interesting let's just get started and the first case I
want to talk about today I call the hypnotized dog this is a very early case
which took place on a small island off the coast of Ireland on December 25
1945 I'm not sure how much Credence to place on this case because it is quite old and I don't know if it was ever
professionally investigated but it is perhaps the earliest recorded case of this kind and it occurred on a blizzardy
day again in December 25 1945 at a farmhouse on an island off the west
coast of Ireland the main witness was at the shoreline when he said a silver
dome-shaped craft dropped from the sky and and actually floated on the surface of the ocean then rose up and landed in
a field apparently on top of two cows according to the witness two humanites dressed in black rubber suits emerged
and one shot AR Ray at one of the cows and the farmer's dog ran up to them
barking at this point one of the beings held a box with lights on it and the dog
apparently hypnotized walked on board the craft both beings returned in side
one of them waved at the witness and the craft took off and the witness said he never saw his dog again and reportedly
the UFOs did continue to visit it is quite a controversial case but there it
is so that's the first case I could find involving ETS showing an interest in
dogs but there are many here's another case which I call the case of prospera
munis this occurred in 1946 in jumilla Spain it involves two witnesses mainly
one witness and of course a dog this case is quite well verified and in fact
the witness has done many podcasts about her experience it is
quite involved I'm going to cover it pretty briefly here it was way back in 1946 when six-year-old prospera munes
and her sister Anita were walking near their home in jumilla Spain when two
strange humanoids approach coached and spoke with them they were largely human looking but later that same day they had
a second meeting with these beings and this is when prospera was offered to
take a ride on their craft and that night prospera awoke to
find the beings in her bedroom she said they wore jumpsuits they had four fingers and she agreed to let them take
her on board along with her mastiff dog her dog was terrified but prospera says
the encounter was entirely benevolent she was physically examined she saw
herself and her sister on a computer like screen and she says that she was actually taken for a trip around our
planet before being returned to her bedroom and following this there were
other encounters which she completely forgot about for a long time until much
later in life so what an interesting case that was it's a fairly typical
onboard experience but really unusual and now here is another one this one is
somewhat concerning and I call this one something had my dog this took place on
June 19th 1954 in wonger New Zealand and yeah this
is a concerning case that I really wonder about the location of this encounter is about 14 miles south of
wonger New Zealand and the main Witness is Oscar marinkovich this occurred on the evening
of June 14 1954 and it was a dark night as Oscar
was drawn outside by the sounds of his dogs acting up he was at his father's farm and as Oscar says in his own words
there was a terrible cry from the dog's kennel which was about 30 m away my first reaction was that it was being
attacked by other dogs so I grabbed a shotgun and went to the back door and my blood seemed to freeze and I was
transfixed I seemed to be paralyzed I heard the dog choking and gasping but
the noise was coming from somewhere above me I realized that either I was going mad or that something had the dog
above I don't know the distance because when I tried to look up I was paralyzed with fear I wanted to pull the trigger
but I couldn't then I heard a thud and immediately afterwards the dog bolted
howling pathetically up the driveway then I heard a slushing sound like something
rotating the noise increased in volume to a high-pitched whining noise like a turbine reaching an intensity until with
a loud report or explosion and a terrible Rush of wind whatever it was
disappeared at a tremendous Pace I went back into the house shaking uncontrollably my heart pounding at
twice the normal rate at least so this was late so Oscar went to
bed thoroughly shook Shook Up by what happened the next morning he went out and found
some weird evidence as he says the dog's chain lay in a heap near the kennel but
his collar was 5 m away open and undone at the edge of the area was flattened
with grass with a circumference of about 40 ft I have no doubt in my mind that
some type of craft had either hovered or landed and that some hands must have
untied the collar because it is impossible for the dog to untie its own collar the dog came back at about 400
p.m. crawling on its belly and whimpering with a terrified look in its eyes around its neck were scratch marks
as though something had held it by the neck the dog could not be used as a cattle dog again the following night I
went to see if it was all right and it sprang at me as though something held it back the following night I went to see
if it was all right and it sprang as if to bite me totally out of character
Oscar of course did tell his father and he also called the police but neither of them believed him clear from the huge
number of cases like these that ETS do show an interest in dogs and that's
absolutely apparent in this next case which I call frisky and the aliens this
took place on November 6th 1957 in Knoxville Tennessee and I like
this case because it also has Landing traces pretty good evidence that
basically indicates that something very unusual happened to this young child on
this day there are a few cases where ETS apparently tried to grab dogs but were
unsuccessful and here's one really interesting case which occurred on November 6th
1957 and the main witness is 12-year-old Everett Clark of Knoxville
Tennesse he lived on Dante Road and he got up real early 6:30 a.m. to let out
his terrier dog frisky and that's when he noticed a strange oblong object
landed in a field about 300 ft from his home now it was still mostly dark out
and he didn't think too much of it but returning outside 20 minutes later to let frisky back into the house he saw
that frisky and some of the other dogs in the neighborhood had ventured over to this object sitting in the field and it
was at this point that Everett noticed two men and a woman standing next to the object
he can't say whether they were unusual looking or not they looked normal to him but he did see that they tried to grab a
smaller dog who tried to bite him which caused the man to release the animal
David did hear them talking in a foreign language which he couldn't understand he thought it might have been German he
doesn't know but curious Everett started to approach the men at which point they
noticed him and motioned for him to come closer this made Everett nervous so he
didn't get closer but he says he watched the figures walk through the side of the
craft entering it without using any door the craft then took off in a steep climb
upwards and was gone now afterwards as you can see here it left a large imprint
about 5 ft wide and 24 ft long in the grassy field and this imprint was
actually witnessed by Everett's father and of course by newspaper reporters
what old frisky did not allow himself to be taken what an interesting case that
is and what makes it even more compelling is on that same day just
hours later there was another case that's almost identical to it I call
this case we just want your dog took place on November 6th again 1957 in
everit toown New Jersey there are two witnesses to this case and it's quite a
compelling case because as it turns out November 6 was a huge day in UFO history
there were sightings and landings taking place all over the world which I think adds a level of confirmation to this
case and of course the one before it that same evening on November 6 1957
around 600 p.m. this is only hours after the above case John trasco and his wife
Ellen were in their home in Everett toown New Jersey John had just returned
from his job at the local paper mill and stepped out to feed their dog King who he describes as a six-year-old charcoal
colored half blind bad-tempered Belgian police dog they kept him tied up to the
side of the house and shortly after John trasco stepped outside his wife Ellen
heard the dog King barking furiously she looked outside and saw a
strange reflection in the yard and staring at it she realized this wasn't a reflection but was in fact a glowing
egg-shaped object about 9 to 12 ft long hovering in the sky and bobbing up and
down in this weird manner meanwhile her husband John also saw the craft and he
said approaching him from the direction of the craft was a strange short humanoid figure as John says I looked
and I seen a little man he came down towards me and he said said don't be afraid I don't mean any
harm so I got a little closer to him and started talking to him about the dog and
he said don't be afraid we're friendly people we don't mean any harm I started
shaking I was scared he came up to me and said would you like to give us your
dog we'd like to have it according to John the man spoke very slowly in
English with kind what sounded kind of like a German accent spoke in a very sharp squeaky voice not normal saying we
just want your dog now as John says he was about 3 to 4
feet tall I didn't see no flesh the only flesh I saw was his face he was all
covered he had some sort of cover all on you couldn't see the hands or other parts of the body he had shiny objects
on each finger he had a strange face you couldn't tell whether he was a man or a
woman now according to John this figure had a broad nose light brownish skin he
said the suit was sort of a medium green color and it had but he believe looked
like shiny buttons but this was concerning John because it was coming after his dog and
he wasn't having it and he shouted at the being get the hell out of here and actually reached out and tried to grab
this figure the being then said I'll be seeing you again turned around and
walked towards the craft now John didn't see any port holes or doors but just
like Everett Clark says somehow this man entered the craft and it promptly took
off now John's wife Ellen didn't see this little figure but she did hear his squeaky voice she heard her husband
shouting at this little man and she also saw the craft disappear straight upwards
and later they were interviewed by newspaper reporters and members of the UFO group CSI the civilian saucer
investigations who conducted an hourlong interview with the tros and as one of the reporters dick
harpster says I just haven't been able to think of one reason for not believing
them and in fact Ellen trasco told him if it happens again I'll probably get in
the car and go far away from this place but I told John we should have let them take King he's half blind and so cross I
don't know who else would ever want him now true to the et's promise they
did return the UFO apparently returned the very next night when the trasco noticed a strange red and white light
hanging over the house and as Ellen says it didn't move as the lights of an
airplane do and after staying a while these lights moved off of course the ETS
did not take the dog so while in this case the dog was not taken in board the et's interest in the dog was
evident and again incidentally both in the Everett Clark case and this case
they do both took place during a massive UFO wave which was sweeping across the
United States this is the first couple of weeks of November 1957 and in fact November 6 alone
accounted for dozens of cases as researcher Lauren gross writes the 6th
of November 1957 has be one of the biggest days in UFO history now I'd like
to play a brief excerpt of an hourlong interview done with John trasco and
Ellen trasco this is Justin excerpt if you're interested you can hear the full
version at the end of this video but I warn you it's over an hour long so suppos Mr TR you just tell us what
happened when your own words well I came from work
and uh I went down the street the doors and I got alongside the house point down
towards the barn and I look I see a old
man but we have hges there I couldn't no the sorer so he started coming down towards
me he says don't be Afra I don't mean no har so I got to little closer to him and
start talking something about the dog then he says we're friendly people and
don't mean I got you know start shaking you know and scared but that time I my B door open
and uh and he came again to me he says well you want to me dog would like to
have him I swore at him or something then he just kind around he he see you
again it was a wrong object and it seem to be Hing down the ground and when up
and go about 10 ft high and it come down again then it come down to the trees there and it come towards the barn
again and then all a sudden SP so fast around can see no can see the man there
and zoom right up the end let a big screen of smoke a smoke or flare was still a t
yeah you can see cuz I stood there petrified at the you can see the I saw that but
IES in the middle of yard we started walking towards me well
other words he he was by a barn there and he walked from the heades he walked
probably about maybe about five to 8 ft and I kept going down
slowly to him to him were you PR oh it's fine yeah uh what did he first say to
you well he says he says to me don't be afraid we friendly people we don't mean no harm he talk Fen English it's sort of
like a German accent how about the tone of his voice
voice was sort of like a squish voice squeaky yeah squeaky with a German
accent was I mean very easy to understand it was a difficult it was easy to understand because he talk very
slow so it was easy he slow and well sort of on a sharp squeaky
sideway well he was last about 3 to 4T tall and I didn't see no flesh the only
flesh I seen was his face a flesh on his face was sort of like if you take a a p in your knif in
your hand and you you squeeze it like that that's how his flesh was you know
formed his arms were according to his size was
short well I mean is he was all covered he has sort of like covers on him you
couldn't see his hand you know his hands or other part of the body it's just the
face and the ears did they cover his hands yeah his hands and on tip his um
the gloves sort of a around objects it was shiny objects on each finger on each
finger what you saying about eyes Mr his eyes was sort of like a like a marble
not the like like f eyes you know they thre out sockets any eyelids that you
would notice eyelashes the cover his face was sort of like a putty color you
know brown but I mean I didn't notice no eyebrows and I mean I I look was keep
looking at his face you know scared he n what what is the dog's reaction to it
by the way oh he was crazy run around Cycles there after you refuse the dog we
might use that turn what happened then well he just say none just turn
around start walking towards the sorcer there and and was still still going out
speed yeah and all a sudden I see then how I didn't see nothing didn't see him
go in or water just went so fast in there and all say one and he walked away
did he or she say anything well he said well saying hear
maybe hear well he said well I'll be seeing you
again but the next night I I was upstairs throwing my bed and I didn't
have the light on I was looking out of the window you know cuz I was still worked up about that right up over the B
there was two things great big white light and a great big red light
and it's a plane G but it wasn't even moving it was just stay stationary a
really remarkable and unusual case and I think if you listen to the full interview with John trasco and his wife
you'll see that this is a case that absolutely did happen but wow so unusual
and it's really amazing that there was another case so similar to it that happened just hours earlier
really makes you wonder and here is another case quite concerning I call
this one right in front of me it took place in 1971 in CLA
Australia and again this is another case that shows undeniably that ETS
apparently do have an interest in dogs this shouldn't be surprising I think they have an interest in all forms of
life but yeah definitely dogs this is a brief case but still fits the pattern
that we're seeing in so many of this particular type of case this very brief
case comes from researcher Jane Thomas and was published in the muon UFO Journal again it occurred in 1971 in
Clare Australia and Jane Thomas writes that quote an object reportedly shown a
beam of light onto a dog and beamed it up into the object which left right in
front of a farmer's nose now now according to Jane Thomas
this case comes from a quote personal friend of the farmer who said that the
farmer would deny the whole thing if approached directly as he was afraid for the safety of his children I can totally
understand people not wanting to talk about what happened to them given the Hostile climate that often surrounds
this subject so I totally understand but it is unfortunate because this means
we're losing a whole lot of data that would really help us understand what's going on
here now moving to the next case which I call Sam healed of
arthritis this is one of several cases in which dogs are healed uh during their onboard UFO
encounter this may indicate one of the reasons dogs are being taken on board
this one also took place in Australia 1971 in New South Wales Australia and
it's a pretty well verified cas case this case took place in Mount Kiera New South Wales Australia and the main
witness is Danny Anderson who has had many strange experiences throughout his life he says one evening in 1971 while
lying in bed a whirling red light appeared in his bedroom and he found himself being pulled upward into a large
room with flashing lights and strange instrument panels he was confronted by a
7 foot tall humanoid in a green suit who instructed Dany to sit in this weird
chair this human had placed a hand over Danny Anderson's eyes which caused him
some pain but as Danny says before long though the pain gave way to a beautiful
peaceful feeling and I knew I never wanted to leave that place a moment later I was back in
bed so once at home Dany discovered that his sense of hearing and touch were now
Ultra sensitive he also found that his face was red and swollen and there were two little marks on his chest which he
said almost looked hieroglyphic but following this Danny says he experienced repeated visits with
insectoid beings Bigfoot like beings and more and one afternoon Danny was
watering the plants in his garden when he saw a mantis type creature exit his
dog's dogghouse his dog Sam and disappear behind it Sam of course is Anderson's pet dog and poor Sam with was
old and crippled with arthritis and would Yelp with pain if anybody even so much as petted him in fact Danny
Anderson was planning on having old Sam put to sleep so when this happened Danny rushed
into the shed to check on Sam and the dog was not only fine he was healed as
Danny says his coat was suddenly glossy and his eyes were brighter than they'd been for years from that day the
arthritis never troubled Sam now he didn't see any sign of the Mantis being but Dan he says he feels humble to
be connected to these beings who he says are quote full of love and peace so
Isn't that cool a dog actually healed of arthritis and yeah quite a few cases
like that I think that's important because it shows I think one of the reasons many of these dogs are being
taken and that provides some hope in this next case which I call
dog disappears in a beam of light certainly wonder about this one this
occurred on February 8th 1972 in Charlotte North Carolina apparently
there were a number of cases like this going on at the time I wonder about it but definitely this is one of many many
cases involving dogs so I had to include it in this episode now here's another
case which should be taken from a grain of salt because it apparently was not professionally researched and simply
comes from a newspaper article which was clipped by researcher J George faucet
from the Charlotte North Carolina news on February 11 1972 and profiled a number of cases
involving dogs apparently allegedly being snatched by UFOs for example on
February 8th 1972 an anonymous young man said that he had just dropped off his girlfriend
after leaving a party on Providence Road in Charlotte North Carolina when he saw
a bright light in the sky he thought it might be a satellite until it accelerated made a 90° turn and
then seemed to head straight for his car he slammed on his brakes and rolled down his window and he could now see that it
was a triangular-shaped object with pulsating and rotating multicolored lights was totally silent as he stared
up at it a dog ran out into the street and barked at it and at this moment according to the witness the object shot
down an orange yellow beam of light at the dog which promptly disappeared the
object then darted away now reportedly other residents along this same Providence Road were reporting that
their dogs were missing and others were reporting seeing UFOs so there's no
investigation it's difficult to comment on the veracity of these incidents but it's certainly interesting given that
that case was never investigated I think we do have to take it with a grain of salt but I don't know there's so many
cases like it this next case wow there's just none really in the field quite like
it it's probably the favorite case of mine in this little collection I call this one we are looking inside you this
took place on January 5 1975 in brownston Illinois it's a very
compelling case because there are multiple Witnesses and also photographic evidence it's very
rare that someone's able to take a photograph of the UFO that took them on board but that's apparently what
happened in this case the primary witness to this really amazing case is
15-year-old David Mahan was at 2:30 p.m. on January 5
19755 that Don took his pet airdale dog Sherry into the backyard of his home
located about 3 m miles south of Brownstown Illinois and he was going to take photographs of her and this is when
he heard something strange as he says I heard an electric sound like an electric
motor and looking up he saw what could only be described as a flying saucer as
David says I turned around and I seen a UFO it was black and shaped like a
saucer it had sort of a glowing haze around its edges went over my brother's
house came from the southeast toward me and then hovered Maybe 1,000 ft away and
some distance in the air I would say it was about 100 ft in diameter and had a
dome on top of it and there were circular like markings on its bottom
that looked like they were built in as part of the machine and it came completely over me then It reversed and
it went back over another field I don't know how far away and then it came over another clearing and then it went back
over some trees and into another clearing and that's when I was taking the
photos so David had his camera ready a RICO 35mm camera and he started snapping
photos at which point this object then moved until it was directly overhead it
hovered motionlessly now when he first saw it this object seemed to be about 1,800 ft
up but as it came overhead it was much closer about 500 ft and it was then he
says that he felt a strange tugging and pulling sensation as David says as
though something inside me was pulling I do not remember going through a hatch or anything it appeared as if I was being
pulled inside it at a terrific amount of speed and I was just suddenly inside the
ship I was scared I could hardly get my breath and this part of it may be a
dream but I think I was in it I don't know how to describe this part but it
seemed like levitation do you know what I mean like I was drawn to it and up inside it several feet off the ground I
don't know how far I found myself inside this room I was in a room it was
circular maybe 5 ft in diameter with walls that look like brushed
aluminum and on the wall were things that looked like camera lenses with a glow that came and went it seemed like I
was in there for about 25 seconds I just really don't know but in my own mind I
am convinced I was in there and I could not move except for my head so the room was pretty much bare and
while he could move his head he was unable to walk his arms felt as if they were glued to his side he didn't hear
any sound the glowing lights circled the entire room at about waist height and
each were about 2 in in diameter and 5 in apart he said the floor below him
looked kind of like a metallic grate and he did notice an orange light coming from below he heard no voices since no
communication but as he says I felt kind of weird and funny that I hadn't felt
before and I haven't felt since of somebody kind of being there but
otherwise there was no communication that I'm aware of he thought the whole experience lasted less than a minute and
the next thing he knew he was back on the ground he had no memory of how he exited the craft he did not see it move
away but he now saw that his dog Sherry who was normally very frisky was lying
down on the ground and seemed dazed as David says afterward I found
myself on the ground in the same position that I was when I was taken on board and my camera was off to the side
of me now I'd like to play about a 10 minute long segment of an audio tape in
which David describes his experience an encounter with the UFO
here some time ago yes I did um and you have
pictures yes have those pictures been examined yes they are now pardon they
are now I see and are they available well
uh I really don't know uh they're with the newon you study oh I see and U
they're are under under um study now they're doing some kind of study
with them I see but um I imagine that they will be available for study
probably within the next four weeks I imagine I see uhhuh now you had quite an
experience uh with that object I wonder if we could get a description exactly what
happened uh you mean the details yes yes uh well it was uh Sunday January the 5th
and U I was behind my house or in a field taking getting ready I was going
to take some photograph you hear okay now yes and um I hadn't taken any and I
turned around and uh well before that I heard electric sound sound like an
electric motor uhhuh and I turned around and I seen the UFO there and it was I
would say that it look it's about 100 ft diameter and um possibly 2500 ft away
from me it I I could say it could be farther or closer but um it uh went over
my brother's house the way it was was looking at it at did and um it came almost completely
over me then It reversed and went back into another field um I don't know how far
away and then it came over in another clearing and then back into went over
kind of sort like trees and into another clearing and that's when I was taking board it okay now would you describe
that bit the bit of being taken aboard just how it appeared to you um well um
it appeared as if as if I was being pulled inside it at a terrific amount of
speed uhhuh and um I found myself inside this room but U it was a
circular it was about 5 ft diameter and
um uh on the lenses I mean on excuse me on the wall there were these lenses that were kind
of uh somewhat like camera lenses and they were glowing on and off with an orange color and uh there was a grade on
the floor and that was blowing on and off too and these lenses they were kind of I would say waste TI around them they
weren't completely all over the inside of the room but at a certain level all completely around me as far as I could
see and uh I couldn't move except for my head and uh I really not sure how long I
was in uh the UFO but in that particular room I would stay about 30 seconds uhhuh
and then um afterwards I found myself back on the ground close to the same position that I was when I was taken
aboard it and my camera was off to the side of me now do you remember the type of
opening that you did you go through an opening going into the craft I don't remember oh I remember being pull it to
speed and then find of myself in the room I see and then you were returned the same manner then returned to the
probably somewh say man I don't really know go by I probably asleep or knocked out or
something I see and then the craft did it just leave after you went back to the
ground uh well I I didn't see it after I was uh put back on the ground I don't
know how long but I was out but it gone when I got up my father said that Helen
was long was that I was gone was really longer than what I said I was I see
because he said you know I could have been inside for a pretty long time cuz I was gone quite a bit how long how long
did he feel that you were gone well um he never did really say how long did he feel that I was gone but um the whole
incident um I would say took around u 2 or 3 minutes uhhuh in my sense of time
yes but um he says it could have been anywhere taken for 45 to 50 minutes I
see but um afterwards I come up to the house to the house um that was about
about 75 ft away from here deciding and I told my father and uh he kind of uh
didn't believe me after first and I tried to convince him he finally did to believe me and I called my
brother he said I was pretty shook up about it but um the same day at almost
the same time I believe there was a sighting at the same craft maybe the same craft by
a some it used to be our neighbor that was visiting their parents about um 3/4 of a mile away from
here North uhhuh and they was backing out of their uh driveway their parents driveway and
getting ready to go home and uh woman she uh told her husband that she seen
something kind of shiny back in the sky around down here by our area and um by
the time she got turned around it was gone I see now was there any sound from this
craft that you heard at all well at first I heard an electric like motor sound yes but I don't recall her in that
um while I was taking the pictures it was probably there but I just didn't pay any attention to it yes now did you when
you were aboard did you uh hear any type of uh anything that would resemble voice
communication or did you get any any kind of uh communication of any kind
when you were aboard you mean POS like telepathically or something
yes well not really I kind
of felt weird and funny other you know that I hadn't felt before anything that
I haven't felt since or had felt before that uhuh of um somebody kind of being
there but uh otherwise than that there was no communication that I know of I
see and has uh has there been anything happened to you since that time since
your experience uh what really do you mean well anything
strange I had several dreams I see and where these in relation to objects yes
same identical object the same object uhhuh I was um in my bedroom and I was
asleep and I heard a noise and I looked outside and hear it was going around the house and I kind of hid underneath my
bed and I was pretty scared uhhuh and um several other ones pertaining just about
the same thing I see and um oh also um we have a dog
that's airdale and my father he really doesn't think there might have been any effect on her but before I took the
picture she uh was pretty close to me she was about um 100 ft away from me and
close to a creek and I hadn't seen her after I mean I
seen her before the sting but um I hadn't seen her during it and uh after
the after the sting she's kind of act funny she hasn't had very much enthusiasm as what she did
have I she has the same excited about anything
uh-huh what time was it uh that this experience took place what time of the
day it was around 2:30 p.m. uhhuh around 2:30 or
3:30 possibly 2:30 3:00 now were those photographs were they Polaroids or just
a regular rooll film they were 35 mm I see and did they all come out fairly
well yes except one which there study now professional photographer in Bill
Illinois is um reducing the size of it they were uh over Overexposed quite a
bit uhhuh and uh the company that had developed the film is just like a a store company and
uh they didn't develop a certain photograph I guess they couldn't I see I
had six photographs really cing that one that wasn't
develop uh have you ever talked uh about this with Dr heinik yes I have what is
his conclusion well I really haven't been able to talk to Dr heinik since about um 3 months ago uhhuh and
U I was supposed to sending photographs in a detailed sheet of it I never was
able to send it to it but uh I asked these people at move on to uh kind of
relay the message to him relay it to him yes send him photograph but you uh
um believe yourself then that you were actually taken aboard this craft through some means which you can't really
explain yes and then uh uh transport it back to the ground uh-huh
okay uh now those photographs we would like very much to get a copy are they going to be available to research
organizations well um they're going soon going to be available some certain
copies of them about three cop of the most clear one yes sending to Dr
heinik and uh I imagine that the if I told the
organization that they could send some to you to the Mason Highland
uhhuh in as much as you've had a what we would refer to is a very classic
experience uh we're very interested in anything that would that will happen
unusual things that would happen to you anytime in the future and uh we'd appreciate hearing
from you either by phone or by mail uh in relation to
this well now these photographs that uh would You' like to have them sent to you
by mail or yes that would be fine and of course uh we're we're
willing to pay for what we get as long as the you know the price is reasonable
phenomenal research it's a very private very small organization in Seattle and we're uh covering the entire
Pacific Northwest and of course we learned about your experience by newspaper clipping it
came a little bit late but uh where was your uh St from pardon
where did you receive yours from it was from the uh the Union in
velia they sent one do you uh no we had it we had it uh picked up through a
clipping service they send clippings on UFOs from all over the country this is a
going thing for our records but um I I would have I going to
have them reproduce the rest of them in 8 by 10 fine what going to uh next time
I would like to uh have my negatives back for just a short time to uh get some reproduced on my own uhhuh to one
of a a private copying agency up here I see I do quite a bit of business to but
um I will have a summary produced for you there very good and them send it to
you fine very good okay and we sure appreciate it and it's been a pleasure talking to you okay and keep in touch if
anything special happens to you what do you mean though weird anything that any
new experience that you think is directly associated with your first encounter okay I sure well thank you
very much goodbye now not surprisingly David was shooken up he felt strangely
tired but he stood up rushed home and told his father father did not believe him at first but did say that David had
been gone for about an hour or more which surprised David and he finally did convince his father David then called
his brother and of course developed the photographs five of which clearly showed
this dark disc-shaped object at about Treetop level
and then came further corroboration from an outside witness because as it turned out on the day of David's encounter
their neighbor Dale Hunter was pulling his car out of his driveway this is about 3/4 a mile away from David's Home
in the back seat was his wife Anne and their children and looking out the car window Anne was amazed to see a dark
shiny disc-shaped object hovering over David mahan's house she says she only
saw it briefly as they drove Dr by so she shouted out to her husband to turn around which he did but unfortunately by
then the object was gone so David now with his pictures developed contacted the FAA in St Louis
who showed no interest but did refer him to Scott Air Force Base so he called
them and they referred him to the Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville but they also showed no
interest neither of them finally he called the State Police in Watson an officer questioned him briefly about
the sighting and said that he would contact the proper authorities who would get back to him but nobody ever showed
up so finally David called the newspaper the leader Union newspaper and told them
the story provided the photos and they were interested they published his story and the photographs and put him in touch
with Jay Allen heck who interviewed him now David says that following this
experience he had dreams of this object coming and circling around the house in these dreams he would hide under his
bed frightened it was not long after David's photographs were published that
he says he received a visit from unknown gentlemen dressed in black as he told
reporters I had an interesting visit from Two Gentlemen Who took possession of my negatives and they were never
returned so this is a pattern we see in a lot of cases people who have physical evidence of some kind it gets taken away
from them now 3 months later in April of 1975 David's neighbors Mary Washburn and
her daughter Becky said that they saw another UFO again near David's house
they heard a noise that reminded them of a cardboard snapping in bicycle spokes
this is what alerted him to the object and looking up saw this top shaped object which immediately shot up in the
sky and was gone and it was 2 months later 5 months after David's initial enounter on June
20 1975 that he was visited again in an
interview with researcher Timothy Green Beckley David described how he received
a telepathic message to go into the woods behind his house and he brought
along his dog as he stopped by a creek he looked up and saw the same object he
had seen in photographed on January 5 of that year he says he felt a sudden
pressure that same weird pulling feeling and once again found himself in that same room but this time his dog was with
him suddenly a door opened and he saw two basically human looking ETS he said
they were 5 1/2 ft tall they had glossy short brown hair very small facial
features very pale kind of cream colored skin they wore green jumpsuits with
gloves one was wearing what looked like a kind of a chain necklace with a small
black box attached to it uh green yellow and blue lights began to flash from this box and one of the
beings spoke telling David that they were going to examine him and they placed David with his dog into a large
glass-like container 3 feet wide 6 feet high the being stood outside of it and
yellow lights began to flash for about 2 minutes as David says I didn't feel any
sensation but I was pretty scared Sherry acted kind of Dopey most of the time she
was live that's his dog so after about 2 Minutes David was taken to a shiny metal
table a machine dropped down from the ceiling focusing first on his midsection David saw flashing lights and
what looked like a TV screen the ETS told him we are looking inside you they
scanned he believe his neck and head they attached what looked to him like rubber tubing to his wrist for about 30
seconds he suspects they were taking a blood sample those he says he felt no pain nor was his skin punctured so he's
just speculating here they then took him on a tour of the craft he said they didn't speak to him or explain anything
but seemed to communicate with each other with a high pitched gibberish David did see things he
couldn't quite describe oddl looking machines weird controls something that reminded him of
computers he saw other rooms with cubicles and doorways he felt like he was in the craft for a good amount of
time the beings at one point told him that there was a quote time
differential the next thing he knew he was back in the forest next to the creek and only 15 minutes had passed but he
really felt like he was in the craft for longer than that his dog Sherry lay on her side on the ground apparently unable
to move temporarily he had to pick her up and carry her home David was left
with the impression that he would see them again and following his encounter he says he developed a strong interest
in science mathematics and history what a case that was really compelling I
often wonder what happened to David man I don't know I supect he's out there
somewhere cuz he was quite Young when this experience happened but ever since
this case received quite a bit of publicity he sort of dropped off the radar so I don't know love a followup on
that case there's always another and here's a very interesting case which I call
overwhelmed with sadness this took place one summer evening in
1976 in Montreal of course in Quebec Canada it's a multiple witness case and
I wonder about this one because it appears that really the target of the onboard experience were were the humans
and the dog was just taken on board incidentally perhaps provide provide comfort for the witnesses hard to say
for sure though there are a few other cases that do speak towards this this very briefcase occurred in a campground
outside the city of Montreal Quebec Canada in the summer of
1976 the two witnesses are Suzanne and Michael and of course their Doberman dog
in the middle of the night their tent trailer became illuminated by a strange light and as the light winked out an
eerie silence enveloped them all three ventured outside and saw a large
triangular object hovering overhead suddenly all three were pulled up into the air levitated in a
horizontal position up towards the craft Michael and the dog appeared to be unconscious and Suzanne herself lost
Consciousness but the next thing they all knew they were back at their campsite later under hypnosis Suzanne
recalled being taken inside the craft where she was was examined by a metallic arm type instrument and she also
recalled that the three of them were placed in front of a giant screen which displayed images of Africa and a large
group of sick children all suffering from starvation all three of them were
overwhelmed with sadness to see these very horrifying images Suzanne isn't
really sure why she was shown the scene but that is all she could recall over her onboard segment that cas fits the
pattern of so many we see people being warned about uh Humanity being on the
wrong path I suspect that's what was going on there in terms of why these
people were taken on board hard of course to say for sure not a whole lot of information about that case but
certainly another interesting case in which someone is taken on board with their dog now here's a case in which the
dog almost went on board but it's didn't quite turn out that way I call this one
a foiled dog abduction this took place on December 2nd
1977 in waata Valley in New Zealand and
I can only imagine what it must have been like for the witness to come outside and see what was happening to
his dog this case was investigated by David Conway of Aro the aerial phenomena
research organization and it took place at 3:00 a.m. on December 2nd
1977 to an anonymous farmer from weat Valley in New Zealand he woke up to hear his dogs
barking and to his shock a red saucer-shaped object had landed about
100 ft away from his Farmhouse he could see a door opened on the craft and looking around he saw two
humanoids wearing silver suits with white opaque helmets standing by his dog
kennel in fact one of them was carrying one of his dogs which appeared to be
unconscious so the farmer quickly got his gun and actually shot at one of the figures and he believes he hit it this
figure immediately dropped the dog and ran off into the bushes the other figure ran back into the craft which
immediately took off the dog woke up and began jumping around and barking now shortly following this
incident there were two other reports of apparently the same humanoids seen around the farm
poor farmer himself was deeply traumatized he said he was afraid these beings might return and take action
against him because of him shooting at one of them and he didn't really want to talk about the incident because
following this encounter he says he was repeatedly followed by two men each time
he left the valley this encounter did occur during a wave of activity in the area what an
amazing case that was good for the farmer getting his dog back makes me
wonder what would have happened if he hadn't come out and caught these ETS red-handed trying to take his
dog now here's another case where ETS did show a very strong interest in the dog in fact seem to show more of an
interest in the dog than in the witness itself I call this one can we examine
your dog took place on February 5 1978 in men Medina Chelli Soria in Spain
again these are cases that are taking place all over the world this is quite a compelling case it is somewhat
controversial but it was professionally investigated and it has a whole lot of information to it this fairly extensive
case took place in Medan nelli Soria Spain and the main witness is Julio
Fernandez a 30-year-old vet was on February 5 1978 that he decided to go
hunting with his point dog named mus and he found himself stopping at a
strange bar this is how the strangeness began there was no other customers in this bar there was a weird waiter who
insisted that Julio traveled to a particular location to go hunting and all Julio remembers is
leaving this bar and starting towards this location and apparently he had missing time was later under hypnosis
that Julio recalled that after he left this bar his car seemed to drive by itself until the engine failed his dog
mus began to growl so Julio grabbed his rifle it was at this point that two male
humanoids appeared they looked human but he said they had almost a bluish white skin large heads penetrating eyes very
thin mouth and nose pointed chin and they wore pastel green coveralls with no
seams in them said they moved with long rhythmic strides and behaved very calmly
as they approached him he felt no fear as they spoke to him telepathically and urged him to come with them so he and
his dog mus followed them in a short distance from the road to a hovering disc about 200 ft wide with a 60ft tall
coupa so there was Port holes around this object and this is interesting Julio
said he could feel a strong magnetic field pulling on the metal objects he carried
he said a cylindrical illuminated tube descended from the craft and he entered inside it his dog mus refused to enter
voluntarily and Julio had to grab the dog's collar and pull him inside when suddenly he was inside this
thing and he found himself walking down a curved Corridor into a well-lit dome-shaped room with consoles and seats
Julio believed that this was the control room this point his dog mus began to explore sniffing at the beings Julio
called M's name which seemed to shock the ETS and it was interesting because
Julio was surprised to see that the ETS seemed to be more curious about his dog
than in Julio himself in fact the beings asked Julio if it was okay for them to
examine his dog he said yes one of the beings picked up mus play him on a
table placed him on a table and began to examine him using a screen type
device Julio believes they took a blood sample from the dog's paw the dog appeared to be unable to move at this
time and the beings then said that as long as Julio was there he may as well have an exam too and Julio found himself
temporarily paralyzed and floated into another room where he was undressed and examined by a metallic spherical
instrument uh he says they took samples of saliva tears yearn and more he felt
some pain briefly which was quickly relieved by a tranquil feeling the E
told him telepathically that Earth was very rich with life and it was the variety of life forms which drew them to
it and he said they told him that many other ETS are visiting our
planet they seemed shocked when they examined his rifle and especially when Julio explained its purpose which they
seemed not to be aware of at this point Julio did begin to feel some fear the
beings apparently sense this and told him that he was free to depart if he
wished and Julio said yes he wanted to go and they took him to a doorway and
Julio was set back on the ground with his do dog he walked back in a days to
his car and he thought it might have been a dream except for his watch had stopped and he also noticed that two of
his rifle cartridges were missing and his dog mus had a mark on his paw where
he had seen this blood sample being taken furthermore his car required
significant repair work afterwards I think you'll agree that's a really interesting case I know Duchess thinks
so she's very interested in these cases her being a dog anyway uh I mean that was a
compelling case and here's another that was not professionally investigated it's quite controversial it really comes only
from a newspaper report did get quite a bit of coverage at any rate I call this
they took my dog this is a case which took place on July 27 1980 in Bethesda
Wales involved a gentleman who swears up and down that while he was out fishing a
UFO showed up and well you'll see it was on the morning of July 27 1980 that Alan
Morris of Bethesda Wales went out with his dog to go fishing near his home
suddenly he was shocked to see a pulsating light move towards him and as he says it hovered for a while over
where I was fishing and then landed in a nearby Field I moved to get a better
look now as alen approached he stopped because a hatch opened on this craft and out stepped three very tall beings and
as he says I realized that they must have been at least 7 ft tall with antenna and seemed to be carrying a
bucket and a spade each now at first the figures paid no attention to Allan or his dog and simply
began to dig in the ground but suddenly Allen's dog took off and ran towards the
beings Allan stood up and tried to stop his dog but he says he suddenly fell
unconscious and when he woke up the ETS and the saucer were gone leaving behind
a burn mark on the ground he says his dog was missing and he never saw him
again again this case was never investigated and comes only from a brief newspaper article well yeah some of
these cases are better verified than others here's another pretty controversial case which I think we
should take seriously because it certainly fits the pattern we see in so many cases I call this one the farmer
the dog and the aliens this took place on March 29 1981 in molala Oregon and
it's quite a compelling case involving a man and his dog who were taken on board
and had quite an adventure and both apparently were healed as well this next
case comes from news reporter Bob Todd who expressed some skepticism of the story but he did publish the case it was
on the evening of March 29 1981 that Mr FB Moore a lonesome offgrid farmer from
molala Oregon went outside to check on his goats cuz over the last few weeks they had been acting strangely
as had his cats and his oneeyed dog named Jethro so FB had a strange hunch
that something was out of the ordinary and as he says I went out to check the
pens that the goats were in it was a full moon so it was easy to see and I heard a funny sound it was like one of
those electric motors humming I don't have any electricity so I knew it couldn't have been anything I had on the
place I checked around the out buildings in the pen and every where I could think to check then for some reason I looked
up in the sky what I saw scared the Daylights out of me at first I thought
the moon was coming down to Earth but whatever it was didn't look exactly like the moon either I saw a Big Bright Light
it blinded me for a minute or two then it just sort of faded into a soft light that made it a lot easier to see and
what I saw or at least it looked like a great big metal something or other
it might have been one of them spaceships you read about that was my first thought I tried covering my eyes
with my hand but the light was so strong it came right through my fingers I've never seen so much light in my entire
life I remember I could see the bones of my fingers plain as day was pretty scary
though needless to say he was shocked by the sight he had no formal education but had read many books and realized that
what he was seeing was a flying saucer as he said says whatever this thing was
it landed right in my front yard scared my poor animals almost Plumb to death
after a minute or so the noise quieted down and things returned to normal if you can call a spaceship or whatever it
was Landing in your front yard normal the animals began to settle down and I
just stood there looking at this thing it was big about the twice the size of
my barn and it had a funny glow like all around it pretty soon a little thing
that looked like a small ladder came out from the bottom and came down to the ground so at this point he tried to run
but found himself unable to move and moments later a door opened and a man stuck out his head and looked around and
seeing the farmer told him not to be afraid that they had landed to complete a small repair to their ship and would
be leaving shortly then the men announced that they were finished and would be leaving and
as FB Mo said I was just about to ask him where they were going and where they came from when
he asked if I'd like to take a ride I guess I took a little too long so he and a couple of other men grabbed me and
took me and Jethro aboard I wasn't very anxious to go neither was poor old
Jethro but we went anyway so FB Moore and his dog were in
the craft shaking in fear when almost immediately it took off and soared
upwards and he he was amazed to see cougar Lake far below
him now the ET saw fb's interest in the lake and actually stopped the craft so
we could get a better look at it and after hovering for a few moments they took off again moved over a city which
more believed was Bend Oregon and then they darted straight upwards into outer
space and as the witness says seemed like a minute or two and we could hardly
see the Earth at all I didn't know they made that much High
we were way out there and poor old Jethro was having a fit I imagine his ears were bothering him something
fierce now to the witness's shock the craft zoomed up to the moon and actually
landed on the surface one of the men went outside and seemed to retrieve a
few moon rocks actually brought them back into the craft the witness says he held one of them surprised and was
surprised by how lightweight it was and then the craft he says took off towards the outer solar system and as the
witness says after we took a tour you might call it around a couple of other planets or moons those men brought me
right back home and dropped old Jethro and me off in my front yard again before they left I asked the man
who'd taken us on board the machine where they came from he told me their home was a long way from Earth and that
they were on an expedition to explore other planets and solar systems they were scientists I guess because they
took a lot of samples and dirt and stuff like that anyway old Jethro and I got
back in one piece and it was about 2 hours I guess we were gone the animals was just fine old Jethro began chasing
the goats around the yard and acting like a young pup now it was then that the witness noticed that his dog Jethro
had been healed and so had the farmer himself as he says when I looked at him I
discovered his bad eye had cleared up and he could see with both eyes again something he hasn't been able to do for
the past 5 years or so and I noticed that my arthritis had cleared up too I
can't for the life of me say what caus of the change is but I can tell you this both Jethro and me feel better today
than we have in years so that's another one of my favorite cases it's quite
positive the man describing his experiences of you know being given a tour going to the moon and
such something I've heard in many other times so I think it's a good
case and now we move to another case this one's very well known I'm just
going to cover it very briefly because it's been widely covered you probably heard of it I call this one who or what
were they took place on November 28th 1980 in West Yorkshire England and and
of course the main witness is UK police officer Alan Godfrey it was again on
November 28 1980 that UK police officer alen Godfrey experienced a missing time
UFO encounter in West Yorkshire England it's a very complicated case but under
hypnosis he did recall being taken on board and found himself in a strange room where he met a human-looking man
who spoke telepathically to him said his name was yos he also saw eight small gayike beings
who he said almost appeared robotic Allan said he was put on a table and examined but strangely while in this
room he saw a large black dog very strange Allan remains ultimately
ambivalent about his hypnotic recall unsure if the details are accurate or not but he did later publish a book
called who or what were they and as Alan said say I wish I'd never seen the UFO
particularly because of the effects on my children it's not easy having a policeman as a father but when he's a
policeman who saw a UFO it's even worse and poor Allen has a result of
going public with his encounter he received so much ridicule from fellow officers and even his superiors that he
ended up retiring from the police force in fact I did cover his case in
another episode episode called see a UFO lose your job so you can check that one
out if you want to hear about other cases like that yeah his case is quite well verified I think it's definitely
worth looking into quite a lot of evidence to it and I mean he actually
did have a healing at one point he was fired from his job as a result of all of this it's a big very complicated
case and now we move to the next segment here here and I call this one a UFO dog
and pony show and I'm just being factious here I think this is a legit case there's not a whole lot of
information to it certainly fits the pattern we're seeing in all of these cases this one took place on June 11
1988 in the Bridger Teton National Forest in Idaho and yeah it's another case of
someone being taken on board with not only their dog but their Pony as well
here is another briefcase 7:45 p.m. on June 11th 1988 an anonymous woman was
riding her Pony accompanied by her dog through the Bridger teeton National Forest in
Idaho she had just passed an abandoned campsite when she experienced a period of missing time and suddenly came to in
a completely different location on the other side of the forest near this swamp so she made her way back to her
own campsite and this is when she spawned taneously recalled without hypnosis being taken on board a strange
craft get this with her Pony and dog inside she said she was greeted by seven
very tall humanoids with long narrow heads covered with stiff wispy red
hair she said they looked mostly human but had long pointed chins a small nose
dark slanted eyes they wore long dark robes dark boots she said the room had
metal tables in it sort of a round shaped chair all kinds of weird
equipment and she said she was placed in a chair and physically examined while
her dog and her Pony were taken to another room and also apparently examined the being spoke
telepathically and were apparently discussing whether or not the witness was a suitable candidate for
breeding I don't know anything else about this case a very brief case but
certainly interesting and here's another I call this one taken with his dog and
cat this is a good example of someone who requested to be taken on board with
his pets and the ETS allowed it I like this case too because it was actually
witnessed by his family so this is not just one person's anecdotal testimony
it's a multiple witness case and there's some interesting physical evidence to it took place on October 7 1989 in Venza
Ukraine here's an incredible case involving a dog taken on board which occurred on October 7 1989 in Venza
Ukraine this was investigated by researcher Mari COA it involves a
10-year-old boy named redo who was in his bedroom with his dog and cat when
three tall human looking figures came right through the wall into his bedroom
he said there were two men in one woman each of them wore silvery coveralls and
they asked Rao to come with them now R agreed only on the condition that he
could bring his cat and dog the figures agreed and Rao found himself floating
through the wall towards two disc-shaped objects which were hovering just above
the ground in the yard of his home he entered one of the discs and soon found
himself visiting what appeared to be another planet now at some point the ETS
apparently Drew tattoo like figures on Rao's body including a cow on his cheek
and on his right palm they drew his dog and cat and a flower now it was around 6:00 a.m. the
next morning that R's grandmother woke up to find that he was missing nor could
they find any trace of his dog or cat and she looked outside and saw something
very unusual the chain where the dog was kept was hanging perpendicular in the
air without any visible support and looking up she suddenly saw the dog
floating down from the sky and onto the ground meanwhile R's brothers were
astonished to see Rao floating down by the roof and into a second floor window
where he was gently deposited onto his bed so Rao explained what happened to
him pointed to the little marks on his cheek and on his hand now these did
disappear after one day but it's an astonishing case of an observed onboard
encounter in fact I did cover this one again in another episode called caught
in the act that's all about cases of people who are observed being taken on
board by outside Witnesses a pretty interesting case I think you'll agree quite a lot to it or it's another person
I wish I knew more about and have a followup on that case but hopefully maybe one day he'll come forward now
here's a case which is extremely controversial but the witness is apparently entirely serious when he says
that aliens took my car and dog that is the title of this little segment this is
a case which took place one evening in 1992 in wit Church Wales and despite the
sort of fous title there this is a witness who insists up and down and
sideways that this really happened and then he will go to the end of his life
uh claiming that this happened so it's quite an interesting case in that regard and also a multiple witness case this
truly bizarre case comes from Keith Robbins of Wales Robins says that one evening in 1992 he was camping with his
friends his two friends in wit Church Wales his friends were Christopher French and silven sway they were
teenagers at the time still in school and they had driven to this Campsite in Keith's Dotson and along with them was
Keith's 8-week old pitbull Staffordshire Terrier pup and arriving at the site
they kept the dog locked in the car and began to explore the area and as Keith says we went looking for a gully area my
mates were a little bit further ahead of me it all happened so fast in about 3 to 5 minutes I walked back to the car and
it had just vanished off the face of the Earth now at this point Keith had no idea what
happened to his car or the dog inside it but that's when all three of them noticed a bright glow above the nearby
trees and as Keith says these lights came from behind these massive trees
about 12 to 15 of them I thought they were Pink Flamingos my other mates
thought they were fireflies then they just sped up and were gone in 30 seconds
I was baffled so confused there was still no sign of the vehicle or of Keith's
dog the next day he did report the incident to the police who did a massive search for his vehicle but never did
find it later that year Keith wrote a letter to the ministry of Defense because he was convinced that ETS
basically took his car with all the belongings inside of it and of course his dog and as Keith says I don't know
100% what happened but I'm going to believe it for the rest of my life I'm willing to have a lie detector test I've
been telling this story for years I've been a Believer ever since so yeah you
can make up your own minds about that case it's certainly an interesting one because it does fit the pattern we've
see in a lot of these cases I mean UFOs are known for taking pars on board this is not unheard
of Now we move to the next case which I call leave the dog alone this is an
unusual case where a man was taken on board and apparently saw someone else's dog this took place on December 10 1986
in San Antonio Texas here's another briefcase which which comes from
researcher constant clear she's interviewed many abductees
contactees and this case provides another example of a dog being taken on board a craft her client Andrew of Texas
has had encounters with gray ETS his entire life much of which are shrouded in missing time and Amnesia he did
recall being taken on board and healed of kidney stones but on December 10
1996 he experienced missing time while driving near San Antonio and two days later he had a
session with constant clear and under hypnosis recalled being taken on board and to his amazement he says he saw a
dog inside the craft as he says they've got a dog on board he wags his tail when
he sees me but when he sees them he backs into the corner like he's been whipped
he tells me to leave the dog alone Andrew wanted to T touch the dog but the
ET replied I'd rather you not and as Andrew says I feel sorry for the little
dog he's acting like he's been beat he's a very shy dog as Andrew's encounter ended the ET
said that it was time for Andrew to return to the pickup and quote the dog
must return to where it came from an interesting case I have to wonder what the ETS were doing with that dog but
again ETS are known for basically pulling all different types of Life on this planet on board plants and animals
of all kinds and of course people and here's another really interesting case
in which a lady was taken on board with her dog I call this Irina and Chuck
taken on board this took place in nkusi Russia and it's quite a compelling case
in which this lady and her dog were not only taken on board but apparently taken to another planet here's a very
interesting and somewhat complicated case of a lady who was taken on board
this occurred on February 10 in 1997 and Irina o was asleep in her home
in nkusi yaroslav Russia when suddenly a bright light Shone through her window
and awakened her and she saw that this screen light filled her room and
suddenly there was a tall woman a tall woman with white skin black eyes and
long straight black hair wearing a silver jumpsuit Now irena's dog Chuck also woke
up and stared at this strange woman and the woman introduced herself saying I am
jalita from the planet UTA suddenly Arena lost Consciousness
and she woke up inside a round room with a glasslike floor she saw Windows around
the circumference and looking out she saw Stars she did see what looked like a control
panel inside this room strange woman was there along with two Andro Android type
figures Arena watched the Stars moving through the windows and jalita said we
are approaching our planet here it is and looking out the window Irena saw a
scene of Devastation and as jalita said here is
what we did with our planet we destroyed it our ourselves and we have now learned to take care of its ecology UDA will be
that way for a long time so this is another case of et's apparently warning about the
environment Arena briefly lost Consciousness and when she woke up boy
did she get a shock cuz she now found herself with her dog Chuck sitting in a
very strange place a bright green Meadow and what appeared to be another planet
said the grass all around her was massively huge and nearby were these strange kind of
red strawberry like fruits her dog Chuck was running around joyfully eating the
fruit jelita was also there and invited Arena to taste the fruit which she did
she said it tasted kind of like a combination of Strawberry and pineapple so arena is just staring
around in amazement and disbelief when the next thing she knew she was waking up in her bedroom while chuck her dog
was barking at her feet she wondered briefly if the whole experience might have been a dream until
she saw that her night gown was stained with the juice from the these red strawberry like
fruits and she felt quite strange after an encounter and visited the doctor and
a blood test revealed that she had an overabundance of luyt and a deficiency
of lymphocytes but otherwise there were no other After Effects I think you'll admit
that's a pretty compelling case uh given that there was some physical evidence not to mention the medical evidence as
well and the fact that there are so many cases of this kind I think speaks to the
veracity if we were just one or two I'd say okay you know I don't know let's put
this on the back burner but when you have more than two dozen cases of this kind I think it behooves us to pay
attention there are enough cases where I think we can say with some really good
confidence that this sort of thing does take place now we move to the next case this
is a case from Arty six killer Clark she's a good researcher she just interviews the witness and lets people
make up their own minds about the story I call this one the debarking of
Treno it's a somewhat concerning case really unique it took place in pink
Mexico the exact date is not given but probably somewhere around around the
late 1990s to the early 2000s and it's certainly an interesting
case so this kind of sad case comes from researcher R6 killer Clark again and
occurred in pink Mexico sometime between the 1990s early
2000 the main witness is Angel a Rancher who owns about 200 Acres of property and
it was early in the morning that he woke up around 4:00 a.m. to check on his
animals and property this was before the sun had risen and he was out in his field when he saw a quote brilliant ball
of light to the East and as he watched it moved quickly towards him Sloop
swooped close to the ground made a wide circle around him and then stopped and hovered about 30 ft
overhead all the animals on his farm began to react the horses were snorting and kicking in their St SS and Angel's
dog trueno began to howl and his Angel says I ran into the barn calling trueno
to come with me but he didn't move he sat there like he was Stone but I could
see his whole body tremble he was terrified and yet he would not follow me
into the barn so Angel was still in the barn he was too afraid to go outside under this
craft and get his dog but did repeatedly call for him and the dog didn't move he
could see that this craft was a classic silver saucer with a large Dome on top and remained for about two or 3 minutes
and then was gone then his Angel says I ran to the field and I called for trueno
but he was gone I think the aliens took him cuz I looked for him all day and he was gone the next morning the ball of
light appeared and so did my dog they brought him back in fact Angel found trueno staring
up at the sky sky and although the dog was returned he was never quite the same again because as Angel says he was
ruined he was unable to bark I took him to the Animal Doctor at first he saw no
reason why he did not bark but when he x-rayed him he discovered that his voice box had been removed he said it was a
perfect surgery first I thought he was too scared to bark now there is a procedure that is
regularly performed on dogs by human pet owners called ventriculo
cordectomy this is called debarking so this is apparently what happened to the dog at any rate after
the encounter poor dog trueno remained very fearful over the next few weeks the
craft returned each morning until finally it was gone for good as Angel says they ruined my dog he
was a good dog he protected the cattle he knew when one was missing and he would find it and bring it home oh was
hoping that once the UFO left trano would quit being so afraid but so far he
will not leave the house it is hard he knows he has a job to do but he is too
afraid to do it in 2010 trueno now 14 years old
passed away and was buried on the property that poor little dog I do Wonder uh what happened to him know All
Dogs Go to Heaven it's been said and I'm sure good old tro ended up there and
it's certainly an interesting case if only dogs could talk boy we'd have quite a more detailed episode wouldn't we and
now here's another really interesting case one of my favorite in this bunch I
call this one Hunter bone and the Grays this is a really poignant case which
took place on December 6th 2003 in Crowley
Louisiana and it's your typical onboard experience in many ways except for the
fact that this Backwoods guy was taken on board with his dog hunter bone this
amazing case of a dog being taken on board was reported to muon by a gentleman by the name of Mike a former
military veteran who calls himself a quote Backwoods Bayou boy in
Louisiana was 9:00 a.m. on December 6 2003 as Mike and his hunting dog hunter
bone were rabbit hunting along a Five Mile Stretch of railroad tracks between Crowley and rain in
Louisiana fact they had just approached a small train bridge between the two towns and went beneath the bridge to
drink some fresh Creek water in search for rabbits and this is when Hunter bone sense something
unusual so Mike describes Hunter bone as quote a German Shepherd 5 years old and
very keen and extremely dangerous to any mortal enemies including trains humans
bigfoots and varmints he was trained in the bayos of Louisiana and snake bite
country Hunter bone was a lethal reality of raw cat creeping hell and a silent
killer a canine attacker and bodyguard and a family dog so Mike had purchased Hunter bone
from a pet store for only $20 now suddenly Hunter bone darted off
into a field beyond the trees Mike ran after him with his 12 gauge Remington
Shotgun ready to shoot any rabbits Hunter bone might flush out but instead
Hunter bone found something much Stranger Than a rabbit as Mike says I
noticed he was stationary looking upward with his tail straight up in the air game or something
rabbit maybe no this was not the case at all was a large alien saucer hovering
40t above the ground a disc saucer with mult varieties of lights and a humming
pulsing sound and vibration as Brave as Hunter bone was he sure earned his
Indian feather today he woed at the strange craft as it descended to the ground in front of us 50 ft
away so protective of his dog Mike shouted out Hunter get back over here
son but it was too late Hunter bone had his eyes on the prize and as Mike says
as he usually did Hunter went into the tiger crawl position and started to creep slowly towards the vehicle as soon
as I came out of the tree line we noticed the vehicle rise and go above us about 40 ft then whoos we were sucked up
into the craft now M Mike now found himself surrounded by quote big eyed little
aliens gray dudes he said they introduced themselves as the Elders of
light they told him not to be afraid that he was picked by them for a special Mission he asked them what the was and
they said you will see shortly Mike says he was placed on an
exam table unable to move he asked about the ETS and they showed him a star map
the Pilot's chair strange viewing screens and when he looked around for his dog hunter bone he got quite a
surprise as he says I noticed my hunting dog was floating around the ship like a
stuffed animal now one of the ETS explained that they had to take this measure because Hunter bone had tried to
bite the entire crew and Mike thought to himself that's my hunter bone the ETS
then took Mike he says to see the moon and other planets within the solar system when Mike asked if they had any
weapons they explained that they have the ability to destroy anything that threatens them but that they are
peaceful they told him that they have been visiting the Earth for a very long time as they found it useful to achieve
their goals of furthering their own species the next thing Mike knew he was
back on the railroad tracks holding a shotgun which had now been emptied of annum Mission while Hunter bone walked
ahead short while later Mike stopped in his tracks when he saw the same craft
which had just taken them on board and it was now hovering over a nearby Field
it remained there for about 30 seconds as if saying goodbye then darted
off so Mike and his dog hunter bone returned to his 1979 Dodge they went
home both felt quite tired he fed Hunter bone a bowl of vitamin D milk he drank a
Gatorade and that was when he noticed that they were missing 3 hours of time as Mike says I will always remember
the entire experience and he felt immense Pride for Hunter bone and said
what a brave son of the bayou he was for me my hero for sure he earned his
feather today unfortunately one year after this incident Hunter bit Hunter bone bit the
mailman and Mike was told by authorities that he had to purchase a $100,000 insurance bond in addition to paying the
mailman's medical bills if he wanted to keep his dog this was Way Beyond his financial means so sadly they had to put
Hunter bone down and as Mike says I held Hunter bone while they injected him with
a lethal dose I put a holy rosary around his neck while he was put down then I
buried him in the backyard now that night Mike woke up to feel Hunter Bone's Spirit jumping around
his feet showing his owner that he was enjoying the afterlife and Mike says that since the encounter he has actually
remained in telepathic communication with the ETS as he says they need
Universal peace from us all I communicate with them and understand their gift to man is needed they hate
nuclear war they hate man fighting and want Universal Accord for us all there
are so many details to that case that Echo the details in other cases that I have to think it's legitimate of course
it's impossible to say for sure but once again one or two cases that's one thing
but as these cases add up clear something really unusual is going on
here I guess it's not that unusual uh because again these fit the
pattern we see in so many cases here's another case you probably heard of I did
cover this before in a previous episode but I think it Bears repeating because it fits so well in this theme and I call
this one the healing of nenina this took place on March 3rd 2012 in Miami Florida
and it involves a really interesting case in which a little dog was healed
the main witness in this case is rero Hernandez an estate tax attorney from
Miami Florida who considered himself a quote material rationalist prior to his
encounter he did not believe in UFOs that all changed on March 3rd
2012 his dog Nina a 15-year-old Jack Russell Terror Terrier had become
paralyzed she was very ill because of severe arthritis and a heart condition
they had actually called their veterinarian who informed them that likely n had suffered a cerebral hem
hemorrhage and they planned to put nah down but it was that evening Ray's wife who was
Catholic prayed earnestly for angels to help Nina and the next morning 6:00 a March
4th 2012 Ray's wife carried nah downstairs to the living room when
without warning a quote small silver covered translucent metal object
appeared and hovered in the corner of the room now realizing her prayers apparent had been answered Ray's wife
fell to her knees and prayed she screamed for Ray to come downstairs and
when he didn't she ran upstairs pulled him out of bed and downstairs into the living room and Ry was shocked to see
what appeared to be a quote plasma energy being the next thing he knew 45
minutes had passed and as he says I woke up 45 minutes later when I found my wife
celebrating in our living room and nah running around like she was a young puppy before this miraculous medical
healing nah was not able to either run or jump because of her severe arthritis
and her heart condition now she was running around the house in Joy celebrating her new lease on
life ry's wife was overjoyed and said that Angels had cured nah and as Ry says
this experience felt like an atom bomb blew up in my brain and I was in total shock and confusion
my wife did not know that she had disappeared for 45 minutes she also did not see the energy being because she was
taken before this plasma energy being appeared it was a state of total chaos
and celebration for the miraculous healing of our beloved Nah by what my
wife perceived to be Angelic intervention now although it's not clear whether Nina was actually taken on board
her healing certainly seems to point towards this possibility although you may have heard that case before it's I
think it's an important case and it's really interesting how profoundly Ray Hernandez was affected by that encounter
to the point that he's now become a pretty prominent figure in the UFO field starting the free organization
co-founding it and really doing a lot of research of his own so quite a
compelling case of a Dog healing and here's another one uh I love these
healing cases I think it shows the true agenda behind what's going on here and I
call this one joy and Ben are healed this is a really sweet case actually
because both the witness and her pet dog were healed it took place on August 2nd
2012 fairly recently in Warren Pennsylvania born in 1949 today Joy
Davies lives on the outskirts of the alany National Forest in the small town of Warren
Pennsylvania unfortunately she suffers from severe arthritis in the arms and hands and she had to take pills daily
but even with the medication she still wasn't able to be active but on August
2nd 2012 this all changed because on that evening she took a walk with her
dog Ben down the trail through the forest behind her house and she had walked only a few minutes when she came
Upon A group of figures which she says were child-sized but at very pale skin
and bald heads they were smiling at her and she could hear a voice in her head
telling her not to be afraid in fact as Joy says I wasn't scared at all they
were very polite and I felt safe the whole time she says a large white kind
of peanut-shaped craft sat next to them lighting the area around them with a
soft blue glow and suddenly Joy found herself inside the craft and she says I
don't remember entering the ship but I knew I was inside because the walls were curved and the blue light was underneath
me Ben was next to me and one of the aliens was scratching him behind his
ears which he likes now as she stood there Joy saw a
quote tiny bright blue light like a star but about the size of a
snowflake this light appeared above her and floated slowly down she was delighted by it and laughing held out
her hand to catch it and as she says the next thing I remember is standing on the
path facing my house one of the aliens was holding my hand when he let go and
turned back down the path I don't know why I didn't turn to watch but instead I
just walked back to the house with Ben and made a cup of tea I then went to bed because somehow 4 hours had passed and
it was late now Joy has no idea why she had this experience but when she woke up the
next morning she had a wonderful surprise all symptoms of her arthritis
were now gone she was pain-free she believes the ETS cured her and she says
no I haven't got it at all and I haven't taken a single pill since I played
tennis for the first time in several years and I can knit again now that the arthritis is gone and one final side
effect was her dog as she says then seems more frisky
too now Joy Davy's case was investigated by a reporter Holly Thorne a columnist
for the Morton report who interviewed joy and then after some research
discovered that she wasn't the only person in the area to report UFOs as Holly Thorn says prior to Joy's
alleged encounter four different people had reported strange lights in the area
three sightings had been reported since April and only a week before Joy had her experience several witnesses reported
military activity in the forest part of the forest was sealed off for 3 days and
when they left some witnesses observed a military truck carrying something hidden beneath a large tarp what it was remains
unknown amazing case and very encouraging once again it shows why ETS
are here and that healing is one of their main missions not only of humans
but animals and frankly the entire Planet itself uh many contactees have called
ETS guardians or gardeners or collectors or this sort of thing because that is
what they're basically doing ensuring that life continues throughout our universe and here's another case that
speaks to that I call this is the last case in this little Bunch which and I
call this one just wait three seconds again this is a case I've
covered before but it deserves more attention so I'm presenting it here
again fits right in with this pattern it involves a lady who has taken on board with her dog Katrina apparently for the
purpose of healing it's a fairly recent case which took place in March 2016 in
Arizona this final case involves an animal control officer from Arizona by
the name of juuli qu or she just goes by the name Juju
she's head CS her entire life beginning around age five when tall grades visited her in her bedroom in Indiana and her
encounters continued she says in the dream in astral states she had many strange UFO sightings lots of benevolent
contact with communication of knowledge and she considers the ETS her family it
was in the mid 2000s she adopted a dog by the name of Katrina who she adored like no other dog she's ever had but in
2016 Katrina developed valley fever this is a systemic fungal infection that can
cause fever nausea lung problems joint plane inflammation and more I mean in
some cases it can be fatal now at the time gu guu didn't know this she only
knew that Katrina wasn't feeling well but didn't know why it was one evening around March 2016 that Juju found
herself apparently on board a UFO as Juju says it looked like the
inside of a football ball the floor came up and met the ceiling that came down was not real sharp but there was a curve
in the wall said the room was dimly lit she felt no sensation of movement there
was sort of a floor lamp like device in the corner she said she saw two men in
the room one was white- skinned stocky with blonde hair appeared Caucasian the
other was darker skinned with dark curly short hair she says almost looked
Italian both wore F length white robes but what really caught JuJu's attention
was this caucasian looking man was hunched over Katrina who had her legs up
in the air and appeared to be unconscious and JuJu's first thought was that the man was hurting her dog and
anger swept over her and she took instant action as she says I saw that he
had my dog she was on her back and she was kind of whimpering she seemed scared
and I thought this guy was hurting her so I grabbed what looked like a floor lamp I grabbed this thing and I was
going towards him so she was ready to take action when this Italian looking
guy stepped in front of her and said hold on very peacefully and calmly hold on please just wait 3 seconds only then
did Juju realize what was happening she was on a craft these were not humans but ETS she knew instantly she could trust
them and she looked down at her dog and was amazed at what she saw as Juju says
this guy was bringing his hand out of her chest she wasn't whimpering anymore
but it was like his fingers extended and were elongated and went actually through her body and he was bringing them back
out and he did this really gently the man then deferentially bowed his head at
gu guu and allowed her to see her dog and as juj gu says I looked down and
Katrina gets up she just looks at me I kneel down to pet her and be next to her
and that was it it ended the next thing ju guu knew she was back in her home she
checked on her dog who seemed to be fine however as the days passed Katrina did see still seem unwell finally she took
her to the vet who diagnosed Katrina with valley fever uh turned out Katrina loved to dig
around in the dirt and apparently became infected and despite treatment Katrina's
Health did Decline and one year later she passed away but Juju is convinced that the ETS ETS did heal Katrina
keeping her alive during a very difficult and important time in JuJu's life as Juju says I think what they were
doing was trying to help her because they were so loving and benevolent to me
toward me and her I truly believe they were helping her so following Katrina's passing Juju
did meet with the ETS who told her that Katrina was actually of ET Heritage as
was Juju herself this incident left a lasting impression and JuJu continues to
have experiences with the ETS as she says I've had the most beautiful healing
loving lessons from them that helped me in my Reiki how to channel energy so if
you'd like to hear more about all of these cases and others like them you can check them out they're all in my book
not from here Volume 5 so there you go that's another amazing case
of a dog being healed and yeah should come as no surprise that ETS show an
interest in all forms of life in our planet including dogs that's 24 cases
that's a lot here's my dog Duchess say hi Duchess get your nose up up come here
go Duchess does what Duchess wants she's a cutie but yeah um clearly
these cases have a def definite pattern I think they're very important this sort
of uh subject has never been covered before I think that alone makes it really important but I really like to
thank you for listening I truly appreciate it it's because of you guys I do this research so thank you thank you
thank you and until next time keep searching for answers keep asking those
hard questions and most important of all keep having fun bye
now e
