CONVERSATIONS WITH EXTRATERRESTRIALS
Apr 4, 2021

Summary:
Apr 4, 2021
Often ETs seem to be very tight-lipped. The only words they speak are: "Don't be afraid. We won't 
hurt you. Come with us." This is especially true if the witness has a strong reaction of fear. 
But this is not always the case. In some accounts, people are able to hold long interactive 
conversations with aliens, during which they learn all about the ETs, who they are, where they 
come from, and their agenda on Earth.

This video presents four true firsthand accounts of people who were able to talk with the ETs in-
depth, carrying on long conversations that reveal many of the questions people have about 
extraterrestrials. ETs provide all kinds of information, imparting sage advice, revealing details 
of their home worlds, and even explaining why they contacted the witnesses. They share information 
about our society and their own, give warnings and predictions, answer any questions the witnesses 
ask, and so much more.

As a result, many people who first were very fearful of their encounters become transformed, and 
realize that ET contact can be very benevolent. Being taken onboard a UFO might seem scary, but 
in fact it is often a truly enlightening and healing experience.

"Onboard UFO Encounters."
