MAKING FRIENDS WITH EXTRATERRESTRIALS: THE TAYLOR FOSTER STORY
Oct 1, 2021

Summary:
Oct 1, 2021
A vast number of people have experienced direct contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. However, for some people, this contact is more extensive than most. One of these individuals is a man by the name of Taylor Foster. A chiropractor from Missouri, Taylor has experienced UFO encounters for his entire life. His first dramatic encounter occurred at age 11 when a UFO hovered over him, sent down a beam of light and caused missing time. In the days that followed, Taylor began to remember what had happened during this period of amnesia. He met beautiful human-looking aliens who held a long philosophical conversation with him.

Following this incredible event, Taylor's life changed dramatically. His intelligence and awareness increased profoundly, and his UFO encounters began to occur at a fast and furious rate. He began having more missing time encounters and face-to-face meetings with gray-type ETs. His experiences continued, and he soon had literally hundreds of sightings and many much closer encounters.

Before long, Taylor started having fully conscious encounters, and was able to converse with the grays, who taught him various things, such as how they are able to carry humans in their craft while darting around and moving at high speeds, or how they are able to move through solid walls. They told him about implants and more.

Taylor has not felt any fear during his encounters, and instead feels that the ETs are his friends, or even family. He has developed a strong and close relationship with them, and his encounters continue to this day. 

This video presents the incredible story of Taylor Foster's lifelong encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials, and provides many insights into the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal I have an interesting episode for you today I think I call this one making friends with 
extraterrestrials this is all about the lifelong experiences of a man I call taylor foster that's 
not his real name he doesn't want his real name used but taylor has had ufo experiences 
his whole life they're very extensive and I think provide a lot of insight 
into what it's like to be an experiencer so that's why I wanted to do this video today 
taylor was born in saint louis missouri in 1953 and his first major experience occurred in 1964 
when he was 11 years old it was around 9 00 pm one evening when his mom sent him out to mail a letter 
he lived only a few miles away from the local post office so taylor took the letter and 
walked down the sidewalk and dropped the letter in the mailbox and was walking home and this is when 
he had a major encounter he was just walking past a three-story apartment building when a huge giant 
object a ufo appeared right overhead about 40 feet over the apartment building as taylor says 
all of a sudden it was like everything was quiet there were no city noises it was just like a dead silence I remember looking around in fact 
i stopped and kind of looked around because I thought how strange this taylor actually 
lived along a fairly busy two-lane highway so it was very unusual for it to be quiet there was no 
traffic which was almost unheard of though this is something we do see in a lot of ufo cases and 
certainly in this instance and taylor looked up and saw this enormous object as he says 
when I looked up I couldn't see any of the stars like I had before as I stared all I 
could see was the bottom of this object there was kind of like a grid work on the bottom I 
could tell it was a vehicle some kind of craft or something and I thought well this is strange 
this craft was big enough that it blotted out a large section of sky uh he didn't quite understand 
what was happening it was clear this was an aircraft of some kind but it was obviously not a plane or a helicopter and as he's looking at it the word mother ship comes into his head 
he's not sure why he thought that he wasn't even really thinking about ufos had not really thought 
about them much at all but as he's staring up this thing that's the word that came 
into his head and next thing he knows he's being struck by a beam of light as taylor says the only 
thing I really remember was a light that's all I recall and the next thing I know I proceed 
home as taylor walked home he felt profoundly different changed almost enlightened as he says 
i could tell something had happened to me it was like I had a new awareness of myself 
other people things I suddenly saw knew and thought about myself in a clearer way 
it was like not necessarily being older but maybe being more intelligent perhaps I felt smarter 
somehow i'm not sure how to word this but anyway it was certainly a big change at that very moment 
i didn't really know what had happened I went home I was really excited I tried to tell my mother 
what had happened although I really didn't know what to tell her it was hard to explain to her 
just like it's hard to explain to you now I remember saying something like I feel as if a veil 
has been removed from my brain the only thing she was concerned about was that I had mailed 
the electric bill and why was I so late so this encounter profoundly changed taylor at 
the time he had no memory of what had happened during this missing time all he knew was he felt 
a whole new awareness and much smarter but it wasn't long before he did start to remember 
and he actually recalled at least part of what happened during this missing time segment and 
what he recalled was being taken on board this craft and meeting what appears to be 
human looking extraterrestrials as he says I knew something profound had happened to me 
within a few days whenever I would think about the event I would see a picture in my mind of tall 
thin men with long blonde straight hair shoulder length I started recovering things certain things 
kept coming to my mind what I realized now is I had some kind of conversation with what I 
call the nordics I don't remember details but I do remember the nordics there were two or three males 
all dressed alike in a kind of uniform what I would call a uniform it was black and white 
they all wore their hair just alike they all looked really similar to each other they weren't 
twins but they looked a lot like each other and they were tall they stood very straight 
with perfect posture I knew we had conversations but I just can't remember what they were I 
just remember things were lit up pretty bright pretty clean I just don't have a lot of details 
i felt a real closeness to them like they were my best friends more than friends like family it's 
just really hard to explain I don't know what they did to me it was definitely a positive encounter
prior to this encounter taylor had been having a lot of trouble in school as a very 
young kid he had suffered from a weird speech impediment which might be related to all this 
as taylor says my mother always claimed that from the earliest age I spoke a language that was something other than english at times my mother would 
have to rely on my little friends my cousin and next door neighbor to know what I was saying 
so this is something that does turn up in a number of close encounter cases 
and eventually taylor taylor's mom sent him to a speech therapist to sort of improve his speech and 
that did seem to work but taylor was having a lot of trouble uh in school at this time he his grades 
were not good and his mom was extremely frustrated and eventually at this point by coincidence right 
after this encounter she pulled him out of public school and put him into private school 
and it was following this encounter that taylor had a whole new awareness and his grades 
improved dramatically and he had a very strong impulse to read and learn everything he could 
taylor's mom credits his sudden improvement in school with going to a new school but taylor feels 
like no it was his encounter with these friendly human-looking extraterrestrials as he says 
this event changed my life forever and I credit it with who I am today it set the tone for the rest 
of my life I cannot stress enough that this was a life-changing event I suddenly had an insatiable 
desire to learn to read and read after reading our set of encyclopedias my mother couldn't keep 
me out of the public library so taylor had a 180 degree turn around and from that point on received 
aids all through school and college he was always at the top of his class and would eventually grow 
up to be a doctor a chiropractor so he credits this encounter with really changing the pathway 
to his life and from that point on he really felt like these ET's were his friends his family 
and he had a deep longing to meet them again and it wasn't long before he started having encounters 
in fact he and his family would often go outside and watch the ufos as sort of a family 
past time in 1965 in 1966 there was a flurry of sightings over saint louis and he and his 
parents would often go outside and watch them as taylor says my parents and I used to go outside in 
the evening and watch them they'd come across the city in waves they were just bright lights in the 
sky sometimes there would be 20 or 30 at a time sometimes they would be in formation sometimes 
they wouldn't be if they were in formation sometimes two or three would break off and do all 
kinds of crazy acrobatic stuff they would put on a real show zigzagging and hot dogging in the sky it 
was just a thing the family did at that time a lot of other families as well it was kind of common 
uh so for taylor's parents this was very interesting but for taylor he felt a deep deep 
connection to these objects as he says although I didn't talk about them to other people they 
really became a part of my life I felt a oneness and a closeness to them that I cannot explain
so this happened many times over the next few years 
and it was around this time when taylor was just a little kid that another weird incident happened which apparently involves what taylor believes is an alien implant taylor 
was playing out on the jungle gym and suddenly he felt something dislodged from his nose as he says 
i was hanging from my knees upside down and I felt something kind of dislodged from my nose 
i could feel something I wanted it out whatever it was but I didn't want to pick my nose in front 
of my cousins so I ran around the front of the house and I pulled this thing out of my nose 
i started to throw it on the ground when I realized it was kind of shiny looking so I 
looked at it closer it was kind of like a shiny cylinder it wasn't very large 
maybe a quarter inch and I just threw it on the ground and went back and played at the time I 
remember thinking oh boy they're not going to find me now why I thought that I have no idea 
so even though he didn't quite realize it was an alien implant apparently subconsciously he 
did and this would not be his only experience with alien implants later on in life he would 
have a much more dramatic incident and meanwhile other strange things continued to happen it was 
just a few years later in 1969 that taylor's father retired and decided to sell the house 
in the city of st louis and move out to a mini acre farm outside the outskirts of saint louis 
taylor was pretty disappointed and actually became quite worried because he thought that his ET friends might not be able to find him but it wasn't long after they moved that he had 
another really dramatic encounter he was 16 years old and one of his favorite pastimes was 
to go hiking behind the house where they had a little forest in a pond area it was a really beautiful nature area where he liked to just sit and meditate and uh 
one day he went out hiking behind the house to this pond and he came upon two deer 
and he thought they looked a little bit strange because they were standing there and looking at 
him but he didn't realize at that time that they were anything other than deer so he just 
continued walking towards the pond and then later came back home however over the next few weeks 
he kept thinking about this weird incident with the deer and started to remember a different story he realized that was a screen memory as taylor says 
this is kind of hard to explain but at the time I thought I saw two deer I stood there 
and watched them they watched me but it wasn't really two deer I was looking at 
it was too grays I looked around and there was a small craft to the left of me in the clearing 
the two greys then led me to the ufo the screen memory worked for a while 
but I always knew that something more had occurred it wasn't long before taylor had 
another encounter in fact it was just one year later at age 17 in the summer of 1970 
that he was again hiking to the pond behind his house when he came upon what he thought was an owl 
but somehow he knew that it wasn't an owl and it was just shortly after this owl encounter 
that the screen memory crumbled and he realized that what he had actually seen was a gray e.t 
he remembers coming around a little bend in the pathway to this pond and seeing 
not an owl but a female gray hovering in the air just above the little road there 
as taylor says I thought it was a female that was my impression it was something very 
alien I can't describe it really well I think maybe it was a gray but I don't know for sure 
as I walked around the road I could get a better look at it it was something up in the 
air it wore a white tunic or dress it was hovering didn't have any legs or feet touching the ground 
i remember walking up to it I couldn't even tell you exactly what it looked like I remember 
walking up to it and having a conversation she conversed with me but about what I have no idea
one of taylor's biggest encounters occurred just one year later and this was at the house 
itself at this time taylor was 18 years old it was a hot summer weekend in 1971 
and the house was filled with all kinds of people taylor's relatives had come to visit his older brother was there with his wife and children it was a sunday 
afternoon and everyone was outside playing when suddenly some when suddenly someone shouted out 
what is that everyone came running outside who wasn't already outside and hovering just over 
the trees at the far end of this 60-acre field was a silvery metallic saucer-shaped object 
multi-colored lights moved in rhythm around its perimeter and everyone stared at this object in 
complete awe taylor's nephews jumped up on the picnic table and the barbecue pit 
and taylor's mom and him were on the porch there taylor's father was right there at the front of 
the driveway holding a pail of milk and all of them just stood there staring at this object so 
taylor suddenly had an idea he had a rifle inside the house with a 20 it was a 22 rifle 
with a powerful scope mounted on it and he wanted to get a closer look at this object so he ran 
inside to get his rifle not to shoot it obviously but to look through the scope at it and so he runs 
inside grabs the rifle and runs outside and this is when he gets an incredible shock as he says
the ufo was still there I brought the rifle up to my shoulder looked through the scope and it was gone I thought maybe I just can't get it in my field of vision 
so I pulled the rifle down I looked again with my naked eye and it was gone
and here's where it gets really strange as he looked at his family he saw that everyone was 
completely frozen in place and in fact the whole world appeared to be frozen birds weren't flying 
leaves weren't moving everything was as if time had stopped the only problem was taylor himself 
could move as he says everyone was still standing in the same position as before 
they all had their backs to me as if they were still watching the ufo which I could see was gone and I thought that was a little bit odd but I didn't think too much about it so I walked 
off the deck and started around the house then I realized that everybody was frozen 
still staring at the same place as they were before it was like time had stood still for them 
but not for me and when I got around to the end of the house I could see my father 
he was in mid-stride carrying a bucket I can't remember if the bucket had milk or water in it 
but even the droplets were frozen in time as they splashed over the top of the bucket 
i thought well this is really really weird this is really odd so looking around uh he suddenly 
saw the ufo it had landed next to the driveway in front of the house and it was metallic 
quite close all the lights were off and he saw coming out of it were three grays walking towards 
him as he says they were approximately four feet tall large heads black eyes skinny bodies 
long arms skinny legs I couldn't tell if they had any clothes on or not 
certainly nothing shiny it was just three grades walking towards me and that's all I remember 
the next thing I know everybody just kind of woke up and started doing what they were doing nobody said a word about the ufo or anything so everyone just suddenly unfroze and kept on 
like as before playing or doing their chores it was as if nothing unusual had happened at all 
and even taylor himself sort of forgot about the incident until about three days later when it all 
popped back into his head and he was very curious about that so he went and he walked up to his mom 
and says do you remember seeing that ufo the other day and she looked at him with surprise 
she had forgotten it but now she remembered she said oh yeah I do remember that so there's that weird amnesia aspect and while taylor doesn't remember what 
happened during the on board presumably on board segment uh he did come away from this experience 
um thinking some very strange thoughts as he says during this time I felt a great calamity was going 
to befall the human race and I felt that I was to somehow help lead people to safety this seemed 
crazy to me why would adults want to follow me and besides where was I to lead them I didn't know 
of course unknown to taylor this is a very common theme ETs do often report that we are heading for 
calamity and many experiencers feel like at some point they are going to be leading people 
onto the ships so this is something we do here quite often so taylor's experiences 
continued very regularly it was one year later he had another dramatic sighting it was very early 
morning he was driving to college with a friend when suddenly this star-like object dropped down 
out of the sky at first he thought it was a shooting star but it was during the day so that was weird this object comes very low stops still in the sky and immediately 
darts straight up was a very brief sighting but impressed him very much and of course his friend 
it was around this time he had his first exposure in the media to the ufo subject 
the television movie the ufo incident appeared on tv this of course portrays the betty and barney 
hill incident and while he thought the movie was very interesting he was kind of surprised to see 
that it was also quite scary and frightening which puzzled him because 
to him the ETs were not at all scary he considered them friends so taylor's life continued 
he grew up he became a chiropractor and I was in 1980 at age 27 when he was going to visit 
relatives in pine bluff arkansas with his mom and his niece when he had a really dramatic encounter 
they were driving along when they saw this bright bright light pacing them along the highway as 
taylor says I first thought it was a spotlight on top of a small building just to the side of 
the road I was driving about 80 miles an hour and yet I was not catching up to this light it 
just stayed in the distance taylor's mom also saw the lights and she turned to him and says 
do you see that light and yes taylor replied and she says well why aren't we catching up to it 
i don't know taylor replied and at some point they did catch up to it and they realized it was 
not one light it was for as taylor says directly across from the interstate traveling just above 
the tree level were four round lights two on the bottom and two on the top they moved as one unit
taylor got an idea as he told his mom i'm going to try something 
he was going to vary his speed and see if the ufo continued to pace their car as taylor says I dropped my speed down to 40. the ufo did the same and then i'd go up to 80 and it 
would go up to 80. then i'd back off and it would back off it was going perfectly parallel to us 
we traveled a little farther and it slowed down and dropped to ground level behind some trees I 
thought well that's the end of it end of it when suddenly it was right back with us again it did 
that two or three times where it would just drop down behind the trees it was so weird this cat in 
mouse game went on until we reached the suburbs of pine bluff it stopped and of course we went on 
my mom and I had seen a lot of ufos by this time but this was something totally new to us to me 
this incident was the highlight of a close encounter of the first kind I had witnesses 
and it appeared to be reacting directly with my vehicle's speed was very exciting for all of us
so around this time taylor what started to have some real uh around this time taylor began to 
wonder how it the ufos are able to move the way they do dart at right angles and move at super 
high speeds and it wasn't long after this that taylor woke up inside a ufo and the ETs gave him a 
full on demonstration of how they are able to dart around like that taylor woke up inside the ufo 
and saw graze inside as he says there were three grays there the inside of the vehicle was round 
everything was clean and put up very well and there was a transparent plastic looking chair 
it looked like acrylic you could almost see through it and it was molded for a human form 
there was a place to put your arms and legs they telepathically instructed me to sit in the chair 
i asked them what the purpose of the chair was as it was obviously for humans and not them 
they told me this was how humans were able to travel with them to survive the g-forces that 
their craft produced I sat in the chair and put my arms in the molded armrests 
it was pretty comfortable the next thing I knew from out of the ceiling came the other half of 
the chair the front half it fit right over the top of me and it fastened to the half I was sitting in 
and latched at this point I was completely sealed and enclosed in this chair but I could 
see out as the entire chair was a clear plastic type substance and I thought okay 
this is different at this point something very unusual happened which quite frightened taylor 
at first little did he know this is something that many experiencers have also reported in fact betty 
andreasen had a nearly identical experience but i'll just continue on with what taylor says so 
he's sitting in this chair and then as he says then I heard a swishing sound like water running 
and I quickly realized that this enclosed chair I was sitting in was filling up with warm fluid 
i remember telling myself not to get excited not to lose my composure but then 
it began to fill up higher and higher and I began to get kind of scared I thought well what are they 
going to do drown me in this thing no sooner had I thought this when they telepathically told me 
not to worry and to breathe you're going to be okay just breathe breathe the lukewarm substance 
rose higher than my mouth and nose and I began holding my breath they kept telling me to breathe 
that it would be okay I thought what do you mean breathe I held my breath like anybody would do 
they're sti they're still telling me just breathe it's okay just breathe finally I had 
no choice but to breathe I took in a big gulp and to my surprise I found that I could still breathe 
so yeah as I mentioned this is quite a common experience for uh people who've been taken on 
board ufos in fact I did a whole prior video about this uh which I called the breathing pool 
so this is apparently according to you know taylor's ETs how they are able to transport people 
and still move at super high speeds and darting around and so forth uh it's a very strange thing 
that does happen to people who are taking on board ufos meanwhile taylor's encounters continued 
one day in 1986 he heard a loud roar over his house he went rushing outside to see what 
it could possibly be and saw it was a jet and right in front of the jet was a silver 
metallic saucer-shaped object easily evading the jet almost as if playing with it and it was 
following this incident that taylor started to see a lot of unmarked black helicopters hovering over 
his house and this went on and on and it was quite unusual because he lived in a pretty rural area so 
this was quite unusual meanwhile the sightings continued many of these were just anomalous lights 
of no real great significance certainly not to taylor who had become used to seeing ufos 
quite regularly but occasionally these sightings would become quite dramatic his next really 
dramatic sighting occurred in 1993 he was dating a new girl and had gone out to eat at the local 
fast food joint and was sitting out on the veranda which overlooked this valley this was a rural 
valley which was dotted with small homes here and there and they were looking down at all the homes 
and just enjoying the view when their gaze settled upon one particular house and they thought it was 
strange because it was perfectly round and it had little colored lights all around it and it was a 
little bit bigger than most of the other houses and this is when something very unusual happened 
as taylor says we began discussing this house when suddenly it began to rise straight up from 
the ground it did this very slowly until it was about 300 to 500 feet above the ground 
then it slowly glided away from us until it was finally out of sight
one year later he had another dramatic sighting this was in 1994. he was going to the post office 
and looking up saw a very bright spherical object with this these enormous cones of 
light coming off of it as he says I noticed this really really intensely bright light in the sky 
it was so bright there was so much power coming off of it it was hard to look at you know how 
a snow cone has a point on the bottom with the ice being the ball on top well this had a point 
of energy coming off the top and the bottom and then all of a sudden the whole thing was just gone
so uh one year later he started dating another girl you know he fell in love 
with her and eventually would marry her I call her karen this is also a pseudonym 
and he told karen that uh asked her do you believe in ufos and she said no I don't really 
believe in them he said well have you ever seen one and she said no and he said well you know 
if I had never seen one I wouldn't believe in them either but if we're going to be together you will be seeing them karen was still a little skeptical but she said okay and uh thought that 
taylor was just being a little bit weird and odd but it turned out taylor was right it wasn't long 
before she started seeing ufos and they would be just walking around or stepping 
outside of the house and there would be these anomalous lights darting around 
and at first she wasn't quite sure what to make of them but it wasn't long before one of these things came quite close and she could see that it was a metallic saucer a dome on top little colored 
lights around the perimeter and she became a huge believer as karen says and I quote I tell people 
if you want to see something just hang around taylor I mean we have friends who didn't believe 
and when they got to know taylor they had some pretty good sightings he's very in tune with them
so these sightings continued constantly I mean more than a few months wouldn't go by before they 
would have another really dramatic sighting taylor was keeping a notebook at this time the notebook 
had reached a couple of hundred pages most of these are about anomalous lights but occasionally 
these objects would become quite close one time they stepped out of their house he and karen 
and they saw this huge object just hovering there and it was off to the side so karen says why don't 
we go and get in the car and see if we can get closer and they did and as they drove towards this 
object it started moving away and they drove after it and uh this began a long cat and mouse game 
ended up driving for a couple of hours 50 or 100 miles out of town at one point they did 
get within a couple of hundred feet but it soon became clear to them the object was not going to 
let them get any closer so they turned around and drove back home and they weren't surprised 
when this object followed them all the way home so yeah this was just a bright glowing 
football shaped object but they counted as another one of their really dramatic encounters
so uh the next sighting occurred in 1997 one year later they were driving along the high 
highway when karen noticed it first a huge glowing sphere of light 
and she pointed it out to taylor he's like yep that looks like one of them 
and she's just watching it when suddenly she sees about six smaller objects also glowing 
and darting around and she pointed them out to taylor and taylor said well keep your eye on them 
maybe they'll go into the big one he's not sure why he said that but shortly after he 
said that boom all these objects start darting around and swoosh they went closer to the big 
spherical object and one by one went right inside of it so that was definitely weird
some years later in 2004 february of 2004 that they had another dramatic encounter 
taylor's neighbor called him up and said there was a ufo hovering over my house 
taylor's neighbor lived about a half mile away so taylor and karen hopped in their car and 
drove the half mile and sure enough there was this huge bright orange red sphere and as they 
watched this orange red sphere began to swirl in this kind of swirling pattern in the center 
and the center part disappeared and it became this very odd looking ring of light to taylor 
looked almost like a portal and as soon as it became this glowing ring of light another orange 
object an orange sort of orb appeared above it and after a few moments both both of them winked 
out it was just a few uh weeks later taylor had another sighting where this object was hovering 
over his house he went outside and flashed his flashlight at it and he flashed it once 
and was gonna flash it again but instantly his flashlight died the batteries went completely dead
so it was just a month or two after that that taylor had a very dramatic encounter 
in which the ET's came into his bedroom and this time it appeared they did not come for him but 
instead came to visit his wife karen as taylor says I woke up and there was a gray standing on 
the side of my bed next to my wife I looked at it and it was gray in color and my first 
thought was am I looking at a ghost then it dawned on me that's a grey it had a big head 
telepathically it told me I was dreaming go back to sleep and no harm will come to her it said to 
me lie back down and go to sleep everything is okay and like a good subject I thought yeah okay 
she'll be okay so I lay back down then I thought wait a minute i've got to look at this I rose back 
up and the gray was still there but he was leaning over my wife all I could see was the top of its 
round bald head and I remember thinking okay everything is all right and I went back to sleep
it was just a few days or that morning they woke up and there was nothing unusual 
but it was just a few days later that something very unusual happened karen woke up and her 
pajama bottoms were gone missing she had certainly gone to bed with them on so that was very odd and 
a few days or actually that afternoon karen noticed a mark on her abdomen 
it was a bruise about the size of a nickel right over where her ovaries would be so 
taylor felt a little bit of guilt there like he had was because of him that his wife 
had become involved with these greys but she was very understanding and told him that it was fine
so it wasn't long after that she had another encounter it was just a few months later in august 
2004 when she woke up and found a round bruise on her chest again it was about the size of a nickel 
so taylor again felt a little bit of guilt but karen assured him that everything was fine that she still loved him and that they were good so around this time taylor was curious 
how these ET's were able to just come into his house moving through solid walls and he 
telepathically asked them how do you do this how are you able to move through solid walls 
and it was just a short time later that they gave him a full on demonstration back they did it twice 
taylor woke up a few days later or one evening he woke up to find three grays in his bedroom 
and they showed him how they were able to move through solid walls as taylor says I was on my 
side looking at the outside wall which was about five feet from me I woke up just in time to see 
the wall dissolve and I could see through at the wall I could see trees and stars through the hull 
it was like there was just no wall there where there was wall there was nothing then 
you move over a little bit and there was a foggy looking stuff and then you could see the wall 
i was thinking this is really weird because there's supposed to be a dresser there and where's the dresser that's what I was thinking and about that time in walk three grays they just 
walked or floated right into the room marching in single file they walked down to the end of the bed 
lined up in a row at the end of the bed and that's all I remember
it was just a few days later that they gave him another dramatic demonstration 
as taylor says I awoke in the middle of the night I was on my back so I was looking 
straight up when the ceiling began to dissolve again I could see the stars in the night sky 
that's what I thought then what I thought was a star from very high up 
dropped down to my rooftop level as it descended I could make out the shape of a craft 
in the middle of the bottom of the craft was a large blue light the blue light began to descend 
from the craft through the hole in the ceiling onto me and my bed and this is all I remember
it was one year later on september 1st 2005 that taylor had one of the most 
unusual encounters with his in his life for the last couple of years he had been suffering from this weird boil like growth on his left cheek 
it had just appeared one day and he didn't know what to make of it but it stayed there 
and he was shaving had cut himself and his wife was checking them out to make sure he was okay 
and she said you know what you really need to do is have something done about your face and 
she pointed to this boil on his left cheek and uh taylor was kind of joking he said yeah well it's 
probably just an alien implant and apparently the ET's must have been listening in on this 
conversation because that night taylor was taken on board and the greys were not happy 
as taylor says I just remember finding myself on an examination table with a gray standing over me 
i could only see the gray from the waist up and he was scalding me like a child he was telling 
me this is ridiculous i'm going to have to take that implant out you've gone through far too many 
of these taylor looked at the grain surprised and asked you mean that really was an implant 
yes the gray told him telepathically and taylor said you know I was only joking 
uh but the gray replied yeah but you put the idea in your head and eventually you 
would have acted on it like you have done before and taylor thought to himself before 
what is he talking about and then that's when he remembered that he had fished out that object uh 
out of his nose when he was just a little kid and at this point the gray started to perform 
an operation on this boil and taylor again told the gray you don't have to take it out I was only 
joking and the gray replied no we have no choice now and when we put the next one in you'll never 
find it taylor doesn't remember much else about this experience he felt no fear at the time 
he woke up he estimates 30 minutes earlier than he normally would and instantly remembered this 
experience and wondered could this have been a dream even though he knew it wasn't and as taylor 
says the first thing I did was put my hand up to my cheek and there was no lump it was just gone 
and I thought maybe i'm on the wrong side I checked the other side and it wasn't there I 
thought well this is really weird taylor uh got up and went to the kitchen where he found his 
wife karen and he pointed to his face where this boiled his cyst had been and he said is it gone or 
is this my imagination or what and karen peered at his face and she said no it's gone as taylor 
says I looked it over real good there were no cut marks nothing to show how they removed it 
however about three days later it was like the skin over it just disintegrated it just 
rotted away it was very strange so it was around this time that taylor and karen started to notice 
weird poltergeist like activity in their home this is certainly common among experiencers 
they noticed doors opening and closing lights going on and off objects moving by themselves 
strange sulfur-like odors all kinds of stuff they once saw the apparition of a dog another time they 
saw an apparition of what looked like a shadow person just weird stuff and it wasn't only them 
family members would come over and they would see it too and meanwhile they continue to have regular ufo sightings one time in 2006 taylor was driving home 
and was nearly home when he came upon a pickup truck stopped in the middle of the road 
and the people inside were staring up the sky he looked up and saw this ufo and as 
soon as he looked at it the object darted away another recent sighting also occurred in 2006
when he saw more objects uh little discs with red green and blue lights on them 
and the sightings no longer surprised him he's become totally used to them one time he saw one 
very close up as he says I saw one the other day off the interstate was hovering over the creek 
and I never even thought of stopping as crazy as that sounds it had a double row of windows one on 
top of the other was shaped like a top my wife and I drove right by it we slowed down we looked at it 
and kept on going so they were so used to ufos by this time that it was no longer news to them 
they often saw ufos not only around their home but whenever they traveled 
ufos would appear once they went all the way to california 
and they had a series of sightings there they were driving down the five freeway by 
the diablo canyon nuclear power plant and they saw a ufo hovering right over the plant itself
so they can have sightings all the time and are continuing to have sightings 
to this day taylor is not sure why him his parents both have had sightings but neither of them report 
any close encounters he does believe other people within his extended extended family might be also 
having encounters because one day he went to visit his cousin and was surprised to see that she had 
stickers and pictures of grays all over her house he wanted to ask her about it but he just didn't 
do it so he's not sure why him but he does admit that there were some unusual things about him 
medically speaking of course he did speak that weird language as a kid and this is something 
we have heard from other abductees in fact bud hopkins star client in the book intruders uh 
debbie jordan kabul reports that she had that experience with her child so maybe 
there's something there but taylor said another unusual thing about him was that he did not have 
normal baby teeth his baby teeth were actually like adult teeth all of them had full roots to 
them so that was very unusual another thing that was medically unusual about him is that he has 
an extra vertebrae in his spine I found that very interesting because this is something a few other 
experiencers have told me that they also have so maybe there's a relation there I don't know 
but whatever the case taylor continues to live with constant ufo sightings 
in october of 2006 they had a sighting when this object was right over his house as taylor says 
i went out the front door the other night and there was one kind of behind the trees to the southeast of us and it was just stationary in the sky and it was pulsating white 
green blue and red lights this is what we see a lot we see a lot of those particular things so 
he always enjoys getting a witness and he called out his wife karen he said hey karen 
there's one out front you want to come look at it and she said very nonchalantly well i'm 
reading the paper right now i'll be out there in a minute so it's no big thing to her either but uh 
taylor returned into the house did a few chores and about 15 minutes later after karen was 
finished reading the newspaper they went outside and as taylor says it was still there but it had 
changed locations so we looked at it for maybe a minute or so and went back into the house 
we checked again at about 10 o'clock and it was gone so yeah this is taylor's 
uh experience with extraterrestrials he sees them so regularly that it's no big thing for 
him he considers them his friends his family and continues to have regular encounters with them and
currently i'm still in touch with taylor he uh contacted me and let me know that he 
is still having encounters and also he has started investigating other people's encounters himself 
and is helping them with their experiences so I told taylor's story in my book inside ufos I like 
taylor's story because it's more extensive than most he has a real relationship with ET's has been 
able to converse with them and interact with them in a real way with them putting on just you know 
demonstrations putting on little shows for him and he's had very long conversations with them and I 
think this typifies what happens when someone gets over the fear barrier and is able to interact with 
them in a much more normal way and that's why I really wanted to do this episode because it 
shows that people can have a relationship with extraterrestrials that is absolutely benevolent
so that's it for now I hope you've enjoyed this video I really appreciate you watching thanks 
very much and until next time keep wondering love each other and most importantly keep having fun
