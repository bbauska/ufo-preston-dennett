ALIENS-R-US
Nov 26, 2021

Summary:
Nov 26, 2021
UFOs and extraterrestrials have been around for thousands of years. The evidence shows that they have been with us since recorded history. Clearly, they are very interested in us.

What is our relationship with the ETs, and particularly, the grays? Could they be our ancestors? Are they time travelers from the future? Have they intervened in humanity's evolution? Why do virtually all reports of aliens involve humanoids? And what about the fact that some ETs look just like us? There are many questions and mysteries surrounding UFOs and our relationship with them.

This video presents more than a dozen cases from across the world in which the ETs have provided information and answers to these questions. These cases show that our relationship with the ETs might be much closer than many people realize. We are not alone in the universe. And as these cases will show, the separation between "us" and "them" might be an illusion. We are all one!

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode aliens are us in this episode I would like to explore 
our relationship with the ET's how is it that greys are able to interbreed with humans 
are greys related to us in any way are they time travelers from the future are they our ancestors 
why is it that there are so many cases involving humanoid ETs and what about the cases 
of ETs that look just like us human-looking ETs all of these raise serious questions 
about our relationship to the ET's and point towards the probability that our relationship 
with them is much closer than we might imagine I have about a dozen cases i'd like to present that 
speak towards our relationship with the ET's and I think each of them provides some insights into 
how closely related we are to them so let's just dive in and the first case i'd like to talk about 
comes from whitley strieber whitley strieber needs no real introduction he's a very well-known 
d and it's written a bunch of books about his experiences and other people's experiences 
and he presents the case of a lady who had a very interesting encounter with ET's that 
sort of looks towards this question and i'll just quote whitley strieber directly as he says 
one witness pregnant was reading in bed one night in 1957 when troll-like figures entered 
into her room when she grew terrified the leader said as if to reassure her 
we aren't interested in you but in the girl child you're carrying
this witness cried out to the ET's that they were hideously ugly and the leader replied to the 
witness just wait my dear one day you will look exactly like us so this unusual exchange whitley 
strieber points out might tell us something about ourselves and the ETs by showing and I quote 
the incredible intimacy and strangeness of the whole contact experience is as likely to mean 
that we don't know what we are as it is to suggest that the visitors are extraterrestrial
Karla Turner
another researcher who has cases like these is carla turner she's a very well-known experiencer 
and researcher who's written a number of really well-received books on this phenomenon and she 
presents the case of a lady she calls anita anita is from texas she's had experiences her whole life 
including face-to-face contact sightings onboard encounters and telepathic contact 
and during one instance of telepathic contact anita was given a very 
interesting message which basically consisted of six letters and the letters were I are you 
you are I and of course if you read that phonetically that translates into i-r-u-u-r-i
so this is very interesting because it's basically saying that ET's and humans are one 
and the same and this is a message that keeps turning up carla turner presents 
another case from an abductee in texas by the name of lisa who's also had experiences her whole life 
and received a very interesting telepathic message from the ET's this was in august of 1993 
when the ETs told lisa that quote they have been genetically altering us gradually 
she was shown ape-like creatures and then heard a voice say they are you and you 
are them this fascinated carla turner because it was very close to the message that anita had 
received and as carla turner writes even the grammar is incorrect in both cases
Kim Carlsberg
another case that i'd like to present comes from kim carlsberg a well-known southern 
california-based ufo experiencer she's written a very good book called beyond my wildest dreams 
about her own experiences and she had a really interesting lucid alien dream that again brought 
up this idea that our relationship with ETs is much closer than just us and them as kim 
carlsberg writes of her dream and I quote the eyes returned I felt them stare deep within me and a 
voice spoke a phrase that chilled my very core you are us I had a startling and profound experience 
a realization on knowing that we are all one one consciousness one mind one being I have never felt 
anything to be more genuine than that moment I guess I had a religious experience but why do I 
feel this had something to do with the grace that doesn't make sense or maybe I don't want it to 
Dr David Jacobs
another researcher who has a case about this sort of thing is dr david jacobs phd a leading 
researcher into ufo abductions and he presents the case of reshma kamal a woman from india who 
actually grew up in minneapolis minnesota and has had ufo experiences her entire life under hypnotic 
regression rashma kamal had a very interesting experience which answered some of these questions 
and i'll just quote david jacobs directly as david jacobs writes during a mind scan procedure with an 
insect like alien reshma kamal was told that she was one of them when she protested the insect like 
alien told her a plan is going to take place and she would be in it that way reshma was told that 
the future would be a very different place and that most people would be confused and frightened 
but that kamal would be okay because she was quote one of them and part of the plan
Jim Walden
many cases speak towards this another comes from jim walden he's a contactee 
from arkansas who wrote a book about his experiences called the ultimate alien agenda 
in 1992 jim walden experienced his first fully conscious face-to-face contact with ETs in which 
he believes he was taken to an underground base this caused him to re-evaluate many experiences 
in his own life and he realized he was a contactee and as a result he sought out researcher 
barbara bartholic who ended up putting jim walden under hypnotic regression 
and jim walden recalled many many experiences and during her hypnotic regressions 
barbara bartholic asked jim walden about humanity's relationship with the ET's 
and one day sometime later jim walden was listening to his own hypnotic regression tapes 
and had a very interesting experience in which he started receiving telepathic answers to the 
questions that barbara bartholic had previously asked him and i'll just quote jim walden directly 
because he says this was perhaps the most significant event in my alien odyssey 
and as jim walden says and I quote I read the statements she made on the tape 
i felt a peculiar sensation in my head and I suddenly knew the answers to the questions 
barbara bartholic provided a mental key that fit a locked area in my brain and then the lock 
opened the only words in my brain were they are us I couldn't process any other thoughts 
alien beings are present with us so often because they are us 
what's very interesting is walden recalled that he himself 
was of alien genetic heritage he believes he is a hybrid this doesn't surprise me at all 
because this is something many contactees have remembered or were told or believe that they 
themselves have actual alien genetics which again shows that our relationship to the ET's is far 
far closer than many people might believe and jim walden believes that the answer to the 
ufo mystery and their origins and our origins lies in this direction and uh that we are all 
human alien hybrids or and or were genetically engineered by the ET's this is certainly possible 
there's a lot of ancient writings from the bible and I mean all different cultures 
many indigenous cultures talk about legends where they believe they were directly 
genetically related to the ET's that the ET's are basically our ancestors so it could be that we are 
all ETs and as jim walden writes he believes the ufo mystery may lie in this direction and not in 
the direction that many people are looking for as he writes and I quote I don't think we'll be 
able to discover the reality of alien beings as long as we have a them versus us mentality 
before we can understand their existence we must discover the truth of ours some of the aliens I 
met were multi-dimensional aspects of myself it's a theme that turns up again and again another case 
Druffle
comes from ann druffle a southern california-based researcher who investigated a case which took 
place in palace verdes california where two men were abducted by what appear to be gray type 
ets one of the gentlemen was told by the ETs that they are from zetta reticula and i'll just quote 
this experiencer directly as he writes the zetta reticulans are our cultural ancestors millennia 
ago they participated in converting earth's ape men to homo sapiens through genetic manipulation
Betty Andreason
one very famous case that talks about this is that of betty andreason a ufo experiencer 
from massachusetts she's had many books written about her case by raymond fowler 
a pioneering and well-respected researcher betty andresen was told by the ETs that not 
the reason that they are doing genetic manipulation is not only to save their 
own species and help them reproduce but because humanity is on a pathway towards becoming sterile 
the ET's told betty that humans and ETs are of quote the same substance this particular statement 
really intrigued raymond fowler because it pointed I mean it answered the question 
how is it that the greys are able to interbreed with humans and the implication is that humans 
and greys share the same genetics so this led fowler to really question our relationship 
to the ETs and as raymond fowler writes could it be possible that alien life forms have really 
been living in such a clandestine relationship with man are the so-called watchers dependent 
on us to perpetuate their own species and if so it becomes quite obvious that their very survival 
is intimately linked with the success of their ongoing genetic engineering program 
one cannot also help but wonder when this symbiotic kinship with man originally came to 
be how could man be genetically compatible with an alien being another researcher who's looked 
Michael Swords
extensively into this is dr michael swords he's a very well-known and pioneering researcher and 
dr michael swards became intrigued into the idea that grays might be genetically linked to humans 
because the fact is their appearance looks very much like fetal humans 
and he began to sort of theorize the possibility that grays are essentially humans but have 
used a process known as nyotni niyatni is a biological process whereby a species retains 
its fetal characteristics long into adulthood this is something that's actually quite prominent 
in many species particularly in insect and amphibious species and as michael swords writes 
nyotni allows the fetal or larva form of a species to bypass normal development in some circumstances 
which results in essentially a new creature and although the dna is the same the quote new species 
looks very different so he's wondering basically if grays are humans but in mature but fetal form 
as he writes and I quote through genetic engineering our future descendants could 
bypass neatney by natural selection and easily produce human beings of 
small stature and large heads similar to the aliens being reported the fetal head 
allowed to develop and grow in an artificial womb would significantly increase the size 
and capability of the new homo sapiens in other words dr michael swords is saying that 
we humans might evolve into beings that look very much like the grays 
Michael Masters
and this is an idea that has been taken up by other researchers among them is michael masters 
michael masters has written a very well received book called identified flying objects in which he 
puts forth the theory that ETs are humans from the future time travelers from the future this 
is a theory that has gained some popularity and it's interesting how he came up with this concept 
michael masters was at home one day when his father brought home the book communion 
by whitley strieber and michael masters saw the cover of the book with the gray e.t and had a 
very strong intuitive flash in which he saw three images the first image was a primate the second 
was a modern human and the third was a gray alien they were all next to each other 
and the implication was that humans evolved from primitive primates to modern humans 
and will one day become grays as we know of them and so this is how he developed the theory that 
gray's might be time travelers from the future and this is all in his book identified flying 
objects it's an interesting book and it raises some interesting points 
uh and what's I think most interesting about the book is it points towards there 
being a very close relationship between humans and ET's I don't know if it really 
presents a convincing argument of time travelers from the future because he presents no actual 
or few actual first-hand cases in which ET's have told this to people or prove this in any way 
and I certainly scoured the literature looking for any cases which would point towards 
et's being time travelers from the future and will there are or might be a few cases that 
might point towards this I couldn't find any that were really solid so I don't know if that's the 
case that ETs are time travelers from the future because the evidence just doesn't support this 
but what it does support is the possibility that we might evolve towards grays or that greys some 
greys might have once looked very much like us which is basically what the experiencer in the 
whitley strieber case was told and which does turn up in other cases so perhaps the greys do in fact 
have the same genetics as humans and that is why as raymond fowler says they are able to interbreed 
with us so there are other cases that sport that speak towards us having a close relationship with 
Other Cases
the ET's there are many cases in fact where experiences are told that they are in fact 
extraterrestrial whether they were ETs in a past life perhaps that seems to be the implication 
that's certainly what sarah shaw was told in the tahunga canyon contacts written by and ruffle 
and d scott rogo another lady was told that same exact thing that case comes from brad steiger in 
his book the ufo abductors a california-based abductee by the name of natalie was taken on 
board and the ETs told her and I quote they said that I had once been as they now appeared to me 
so once again we have this implication that ET's and us are the same
Human Evolution
and one fact that has always been very interesting to me is the fact that there are 
human looking ETs because that raises serious questions about human evolution 
did we even evolve on this planet if there are ET's out there that look just like us where did 
they come from and where did we come from because the theory of evolution while very popular is not 
fact we don't know for sure that we in fact evolved from primitive primates and there's a 
very interesting book out there called humans are not from earth written by ellis silver 
this is a very large book 500 some pages it's gotten mixed reviews but it does raise some 
very interesting points that humans are not particularly well adapted to earth 
the gravity seems to be a little bit too heavy many people suffer from back problems 
he also points out that sunlight itself is very damaging to humans many animals on earth have 
what is known as nictitating eyes or eye eyes with double membranes multiple eyelids humans do not 
and we suffer very badly from all kinds of eye problems such as cataracts this is one 
of the theories ellis silver puts forth that there are many biological aspects 
about us that are different from animals and not well suited to earth 
most animals are able to forage naturally for food eating raw meats and raw foods of all kinds 
while humans cannot often we have to prepare our food he also points out that we are hairless 
unlike most animals and we can only survive in a very narrow temperature range we also 
suff we also suffer from a very wide range of diseases and allergies and all sorts of things 
so he presents sort of an argument a case that humans might not have evolved on earth 
it's a very interesting book and I think it's worth definitely taking a look at 
though again it has gotten some pretty mixed reviews so those are the cases that I could find 
My Experience
which sort of point towards our relationship with ETs and I did have my own experience with this 
i wouldn't really call myself a contactee I have had some sightings i've had some really 
interesting alien dreams and I did have what in a weird experience which i'll call a download 
i've heard many contactees talk about how they've received telepathic messages from the ET's 
and I have had that experience and I did have this one huge unusual experience with what 
appears to be a download at the time I was really meditating a lot on who are the greys and what is 
our relationship to them and I was laying down one afternoon when this vision entered into my head it 
was not a dream I was fully awake and yet I could see it in full living color it was really unusual 
and what I saw was the face of a gentleman a normal human looking guy and it was quickly 
replaced by another image of the same man only he was now bald and then there was another image of 
the same gentleman except now that his his facial features looked slightly damaged his nose had 
started to disappear his ears had fallen off his lips had become smaller it looked as if he had had 
genetic damage from radiation much like we've seen in holocaust victims from the nuclear holocaust 
and this first image of the normal human looking male was proceed followed by a series of 
about a hundred other images one after another flipping through very quickly like a deck of cards 
showing how a normal human looking male became genetically damaged and ended up looking exactly 
like a gray e.t with the large dark eyes the large head the hairless head the small nose and lips 
and ears and so forth so the implication was that grays are essentially human 
and I think this may in fact be true because this is the message a number of contactees have been 
given that's the case there's a case in my latest book wondrous which the ET's basically told her 
that they once looked like human beings so that could be absolutely what's going on here grays may 
look alien but in fact they are human like us but just genetically damaged I don't know we're still 
at the point of speculating I wrote about these above cases in my book not from here volume two 
and uh I think the important thing is to realize that there are human looking ETs 
and that ETs in general are reported in humanoid form even when it comes 
to praying mantis ET's they look humanoid and for that matter the praying mantis ETs 
have their own counterpart here on earth with the praying mantis insect so perhaps genetics 
are universal throughout the galaxy and throughout the universe perhaps genetics is basically the 
template that is used by entities throughout the physical three-dimensional universe I don't know 
hard to say this is speculation but it does answer the question that i'm asked so often 
is who do you think the grays are and what is our relationship to them and my conclusion is that the 
relationship between us and the greys is probably far closer than we realize 
they are perhaps our ancestors or certainly uh much more closely related to us than we might 
at first think so that's it for today I hope you've enjoyed this episode I 
want to thank you very much for watching I really appreciate it and until next time keep having fun
