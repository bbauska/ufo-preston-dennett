Summary:
May 30, 2020
UFO healing cases are more common than you might think. This video presents more than 25 well-known 
UFO researchers, each who have investigated multiple cases of UFO healings. At least one healing 
from each researcher is presented. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are now more than 
300 documented cases, stretching back more than 100 years and coming from all across the world.

If you'd like to know more about the ET agenda on our planet, and learn about the more benevolent 
aspects of UFO contact, my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs: 300 True Cases" takes a comprehensive 
look at UFO healing cases, is now available on Amazon.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett today  I want to explain to you in 10 minutes or less  
why I think the healing of humanity is one of the  main ET agendas reason I feel this way is because  
most major researchers have uncovered cases like  these here are some of them and I'm warning you  
there are a lot Dimity green Beckley he uncovered  a case involving a journalist from New York who  
Dimity Beckley
had cut his hand had a close-up encounter and just  by being in the presence of a UFO his wound was  
healed Richard and Li ke Boylan they wrote a book  together about some of their investigations dr.  
Richard Boylan
Boylan says that he uncovered a case involving  a lady who was cured of an ovarian cyst Joseph  
Joseph Burks
Burks MD he's been in this field for a while and  as I investigated a few healing cases one of them  
involves a man from Florida who was cured of a  torn cornea and was later cured of lung cancer  
another researcher is rt6 Keller Clark who's  written three books probably more upcoming she's  
RT6 Keller Clark
uncovered several healing cases one that comes  to mind is a medicine woman a Native American  
woman from the United States who cut her ankle  with an axe was visited by ETS who cured her  
of her foot wound this is Constance clear she's  a researcher from the Midwest who wrote a book  
RT7 Constance Clear
about her investigations she uncovered a case of  a gentleman from Texas who was cured of kidney  
stones Gordon Creighton he's a researcher from the  UK really the first person to ever write about UFO  
Gordon Creighton
healings he uncovered several cases one of them  involved a man who jumped from a train and broke  
his legs and was subsequently picked up by a UFO  and jerd another english researcher Toni Dodd very  
Toni Dodd
prominent researcher he uncovered the case of  a gentleman in England who was cured of stomach  
problems and druffle she's been in this field for  years and years has uncovered a few healing cases  
Dr Mary Ann Smith
one involves a woman who was cured of breast  cancer following a visit by ETS Edith Fiore  
Dr Edith Fiore
PhD she's actually the first person with a PhD to  write a book about UFO abductions she said fully  
half of the cases she investigated had healings  one involves two sisters who were healed of a  
yeast infection later when the sisters was healed  of cancer she's got a lot of other cases like a  
gentleman was cured of angioma a malformation of  the blood vessels of the brain Timothy good a very  
Timothy Good
prominent researcher the UK has uncovered several  healing cases he reported on one case of a lady  
from Puerto Rico who was cured of cancer bill  Hamilton has been in this field for a very long  
Bill Hamilton
time I was written a number of bucks he researched  a case involving a Southern California woman  
who was diagnosed with the cystic mass in her  breast and was about to have it removed but had  
an encounter went to go have surgery and assist  was gone before and after x-rays the whole deal  
ray narrow Hernandez he's exploded onto the field  pretty recently and after he reports on the case  
Ray Narrow Hernandez
of the healing of his dog Nina so that was just  one healing case he co-founded the organization  
free which uncovered many many healing cases I  mean everything from headaches to hemorrhoids many  
Cynthia Hind
other researchers Cynthia hind was certainly South  Africa's or Africa's leading researcher for many  
years she uncovered a case involving the woman  who was cured of jaundice during her encounter  
Budd Hopkins probably leading abduction researcher  for some time he never wrote about any UFO healing  
Budd Hopkins
cases though I did corner him at a conference in  Sandy and he admitted that yes he's got several of  
them in his files and I believe that one of them  would be Debbie Jordan from his book intruders who  
did reveal that she had a tumor that was cured  David Jacobs he's had a number of books written  
David Jacobs
on this subject it's been researching him for  many years he's uncovered several healing cases  
probably one of the most impressive impressive is  about a young girl named Alice Haggerty who was  
cured of diphtheria Barbara lamb another amazing  research was conducted hundreds upon hundreds of  
Barbara Lamb
hypnotic regressions has several healing cases one  of a lady was struck by a team of light and healed  
of back pain another involving a gentleman who  was cured of a hole in his heart and many others  
Jim Lorenzen
Jim and Cora Lorenzen they're pioneers in this  field for sure multiple books that one covered  
a number of healing cases one involves Sergeant  Charles Moody who during his abductions injured  
his back and the ETS cured him of his back injury  while onboard the UFO using a cylindrical type  
device John Mack MD he's written a number of books  very prominent in the field he uncovered several  
John Mack MD
healing cases one involving a man who was cured  of polio another involving a cure of pneumonia  
Chris rutkowski he's a Canadian researcher who has  of course on cover healing cases one involving a  
Chris Rutkowski
lady in Canada who was cured of kidney disease  Yvonne Smith is a very prominent researcher in  
Yvonne Smith
Southern California as I'm covered healing cases  one involving a possible cure of AIDS and that's  
certainly not the only case I know of bobbing  AIDS Brad Steiger has written dozens of books  
Brad Steiger
on this subject has an interviewed many people  who've reported healings one comes from a lady  
a farmer who gashed her hand on farm equipment  was taken on board a UFO and cured of her hand  
would Wendell Stephen has had a number of books  written on the subject has researched this subject  
Wendell Stephen
for many years has uncovered of course many  healing cases one involving a young boy who  
was cured of supposedly fatal cerebral aneurysm  Leo sprinkle is another pioneer in this field in  
Leo Sprinkle
fact he's the first to use hypnotic regression  to recover memories from missing time but he  
uncovered a case involving the lady who was cured  of sinusitis another involving a gentleman was  
cured of kidney stones and scars on his lungs from  tuberculosis Carla Turner she wrote two books on  
Carla Turner
the subject at least and uncovered at least one  healing case involving a person who was taken on  
board a UFO and observed a gentleman whose body  was being opened and closed using a laser-like  
instrument like we've seen on Star Trek Jacmel  a very well known researcher highly regarded in  
Jacmel
this field he of course reports on a well-known  case involving a French doctor who was struck  
by a beam of light and cured of an axe wound on  his foot and partial paralysis he had received  
from the Vietnam War certainly not the only case  of multiple healings I've uncovered many many  
healings myself a woman from Norway healed of  back pain a guy from North Carolina healed of a  
blood clot a woman from the East Coast cured of  glaucoma a man from England cured a foot pain a  
girl from Florida who was cured of leukemia a  lady from Georgia Georgia fatal injuries from  
a car accident later of assist and other cases  balm tumors pneumonia severe sunburn and more  
so my point is these cases are not as rare  as you might think I've documented 300 cases  
in my book the healing power of UFOs I'm guessing  there are at least a hundred times more than that  
and that's why I think that one of the main et  agendas on our planet is the healing of humanity  
for whatever they seem to be very interested  in us thanks for listening and keep having fun
