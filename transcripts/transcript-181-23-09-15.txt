What is it like to see an alien, to have a face-to-face encounter with an actual extraterrestrial? An experience like this often affects the witnesses on multiple levels, challenging them mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. It is a superlative experience that leaves them changed forever. Here are ten cases coming from across the world, spanning five decades, involving close-up encounters with strange humanoids. These cases provide profound insights into the nature of ET contact. They also contain compelling evidence of UFO reality.

THE QUIZZICAL ALIEN. May 1957, Frances Sticler was working on her farm in Milford, PA when she heard a loud whirring sound and sees a bowl-shaped craft approach and hover a mere 15 feet over her barn. The craft tilted towards her and to her amazement, she saw a humanoid looking down at her with a strange expression on his face.

IT WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. It was 5:30 a.m., on Jul 13, 1959, when Eileen Moreland was working on her farm in Blenheim, NZ. Looking up, she saw a circular craft zooming down towards her. It hovered a short distance away, sending out waves of heat. Inside she saw two humanoid figures. One stood up and appeared to look down at her. It was an experience which would have huge repercussions for years to come.

THE UFO HEADACHE. On the night of July 26, Adilson Batista Azevedo (age 14) joined his two friends to watch a movie at a theater in Carazinho, Brazil. On their way, a UFO swooped down and hovered overhead. Adilson’s friends fled in fear. But Adilson stayed to watch as first one craft and then another landed in the field next to him. Then out came short humanoid figures. Adilson approached closer and saw things that would affect him for the rest of his life.

THEY WERE NOT HUMAN. On the morning of Aug 13, 1965, Ellen Grace Ryerson and her sister, Laura Jean were working in a bean field along Russel Road near their home in Renton, WA, when they saw two humanoid figures. The sisters approached and were shocked to see that the figures had grey skin, bulging frog-like eyes, and wore strange outfits. They were not human!

IT KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW. On the evening of Jul 12, 1968, five children saw a UFO hovering near their home in Saint Stanislas-of-Kostka in Quebec, Canada. Running outside, they saw a short humanoid with a face like a frog. The children panicked and ran back inside. Later, they would find physical evidence in the form of landing traces.

I KNOW WHAT I SAW. It was an early fall morning in Summit County, UT, when Lennis Gines and her son Sam saw a UFO hovering only a few feet above the ground 450 feet from their home. It remained in place for more than 45 minutes before Sam went outside to confront them. That’s when he saw the strange humanoids coming in and out of the craft.

WE WERE FRIGHTENED AND FASCINATED. Mar 28, 1973, Clyde Donahower, his wife and their 8-year-old son saw a UFO near their home in Robesonia, PA. Inside they could see the silhouette of a humanoid figure busily moving around. When the craft remained for almost an hour, they decided to call the police.

I FELT A COLD SWEAT. It was a normal evening at work in a factory at Meylan, France when Julien Hermann received the shock of his life: a sparkling, glowing, green, humanoid figure stood outside his office window, only 50 feet away. At the same time, his radio filled with static. He ran outside to get a closer look.

TWO THINGS CAME DOWN. It was the middle of the night when teenager, Deanne Kerns saw a grayish saucer sending down a beam of light near her home in Ord, NE. Suddenly, two strange beings with arms like tentacles appeared in the beam, levitated down to the ground, and began picking vegetation and taking soil samples.

TWO LITTLE MEN CAME OUT. It was early evening in 1990 when goat-herder, Flores de Mamani and her dog were taking her goats to her home in Tucuman, Argentina, home and suddenly they all became paralyzed. A large spherical object appeared overhead and out came two small humanoids who walked up to Flores and took a blood sample. The other approached her goat and did something she could hardly believe.

These ten cases are only a small sampling of the huge number of humanoid encounters that are occurring across this planet. The time for skepticism is over. Governments across the world are admitting to the reality of the ET presence on our planet. The evidence is undeniable. We are being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrials. And it is the humanoid cases that reveal why they are here and their agenda on our planet.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I love talking about humanoids and that's what I want to talk about today I call this episode I saw an alien yeah it's all about humanoids humanoids humanoids 
sightings are absolutely interesting don't get me wrong but when people have face-to-face contact 
this is when we really start to get a good close look at what is going on with extraterrestrials 
visiting our planet now I've got 10 cases for you today coming from all over the world 
reaching back to the 1950s all the way up to the 1990s that I would like to present to you today 
so yeah that's five Decades of contact these cases come from across the United States Canada South 
America Brazil Argentina there's a case in France one in New Zealand so yeah all across the planet 
this is an important point this is absolutely a global phenomenon and many different types of 
ETS as well a wide variety of humanoids and I chose these cases because I think each of 
them are interesting in their own and unique way offering some level of credibility that perhaps 
other cases don't have or insights into what it's like to have ET contact and so forth some really 
unusual cases here some really remarkable evidence and there's a lot of cases 10 full cases so let's 
just get started in the first case I'd like to talk about today I call the quizzical alien 
and this took place in Milford Pennsylvania and it's quite an unusual case I like this one because 
it involves a absolutely human looking E.T who reacts in a way that I find quite interesting
the main witness in this case is Miss Francis stickler and it was May of 1957 
and Francis was doing the chores on her Farm in the morning when she heard a loud whirring sound 
and looking outside she saw a sort of bowl-shaped object approaching and it stopped about 15 feet 
over her Barn this wasn't a huge object only about 15 feet in diameter which she estimates 
a three foot wide rim and as it hovered this object actually tilted towards her 
and this allowed her to see a man standing inside very near to the rim of this craft 
there was sort of a Coppola or a dome on top and she could only see the upper part of his 
body but she did see that he wore a loose fitting suit and helmet all light gray in color he was of 
normal height but had deep set eyes tanned skin and she said a quizzical expression on his face 
she stared in shock at him for just a few moments at which point the craft left towards 
the southeast making a whirring noise so that is a briefcase but I just find it fascinating how 
this E.T is looking down on the witness with a quizzical expression as if he's somewhat 
amused perhaps by the witnesses reaction I don't know but like many cases it does seem to be an 
intentional display where the ET showed itself on purpose of course that is pure speculation 
but judging how close this was to the witness I think it's a good possibility 
and here's another case that's very similar although much more extensive really quite dramatic 
I call this one it was a terrible experience and that is a quote from the witness who was 
quite traumatized and certainly frightened by her encounter which took place in Blenheim New Zealand 
there has been some recent attention paid to this case and I think you'll find it quite fascinating for a number of reasons on all the cases in this episode 
I think this one is certainly the most interesting to me and it was 5 30 a.m on July 13 1959 when 
Eileen Moreland had her encounter at her Farm which was located at the corner of Old Renwick 
Road and Coleman's road again in Blenheim New Zealand and I'll just quote the witness 
directly because Eileen describes very lucidly very much in detail exactly what happened to her 
as she says in her own words on July 13 1959 I saw a flying saucer very close to me and 
it is something I will never forget I have a small farmlet of nine acres of milk cows 
this particular Monday morning I got up as usual and went to milk the morning was very cold with 
a hard Frost and a heavy Bank of clouds which was estimated later at about two thousand feet 
as I went I noticed a greenish glow in the cloud and at first thought it must be the moon until I 
realized it was the wrong side of the sky for the Moon while I was looking I saw two green lights 
like eyes suddenly break through the cloud and realized that they were coming towards the ground 
I looked around me and noticed that everything was lit up with the peculiar green light so 
penetratingly clear that every twig on the row of peach trees running through the center of the 
paddock was very clearly defined as was every blade of grass and every dried thistle stalk 
I looked down at myself and realized that I was lit by this weird green glow too 
something told me I shouldn't be here and I pelted for the pine trees and Galloping 
among the cows which were also clearly lit up I dived behind a tree and turned to look back 
by this time the lights had come to within a few feet of the ground and I was horrified to 
see a large flying ship hovering only a few yards from me it was a large circular ungainly affair 
so you can see a drawing of The Craft here this was made in detail she also drew the craft she 
estimates it was about 30 feet across eight feet high and silver Gray colored 
and so close and again I'll just quote Eileen directly as Eileen says in her own words 
as it drifted slowly to within a few feet of the ground I noticed that it had two bands of 
jets around it which stuck out all around it like rays of the Sun when the ship stopped the 
Flames disappeared the two bands began whirling at high speed one one way and one the other the 
top was of clear Plexiglas or some similar clear stuff and was lit up with a clear white light 
I then noticed that there were two figures seated in the cabin they were dressed similarly in almost skin-tight silvery suits like aluminum foil which gave off 
little points of light like aluminum does if it is crumpled and held under a light 
huge helmets covered their heads and took an almost from one shoulder tip to the other 
suddenly the rear figure stood up and leaned forward onto his hands and looked at something 
in front of him there was a flickering light which was lighting up the figure in front but 
I could not see what it was suddenly the rear figure sat down the ship tilted slightly the 
bands of jets stopped whirling disappeared then reappeared in the fixed Sun's raised position 
and then shot straight up the sky at a speed that had to be seen to be believed and with 
a high-pitched shriek that was unnerving after a moment the error around me became noticeably 
warmer and there was a strong smell like burning paper which seemed to stick in my throat for hours 
now Eileen did describe this smell later as sort of a peppery smell some have speculated it might 
have been a strong ozone odor which can be quite powerful but Eileen did describe these figures 
that she saw as being about five feet tall now she didn't get a good look at their faces because the 
helmets were sort of opaque looking or reflective and after this craft left she was quite Shook Up 
she did however go and milk the cows and then went directly inside and woke up her husband Frederick 
and she told him what happened and he thought for a moment she was joking or nuts but absolutely 
took her story seriously and then asked her have you rung the police or air Department 
she said she hadn't and told him who was going to believe I saw such a thing 
but he persuaded her to call so they did call and shortly later not only did the police arrived but 
an officer from the Royal New Zealand Air Force showed up and questioned her in fact the Air Force 
took her story very seriously and conducted a lengthy investigation something that they 
would later deny though we do know happened because we've got the documents to prove it 
now unknown to Eileen there were other Witnesses there was a Mr Roy a holdaway who lived three miles to the East and was in his house when he 
saw his room fill with an intensely bright white orange kind of green color and then fade away 
and it really puzzled him because he first thought it was a car but there was no sound and as Roy says it was much brighter than car lights and there was no noise it did 
not pass as car lights do and I could see it traveling from east to west towards Blenheim 
so such a shame he didn't actually go out and take a closer look at it but apparently this object either going towards the farm perhaps or I do think it's related 
because it did occur in the same area at the same time roughly no there are is a quite an aftermath 
to this case because after the incident Eileen did suffer from some pretty severe pains swelling 
brown spots and small blisters which appeared on the left side of her face and left hand where she 
says she had been most exposed to the light or the radiation from this UFO and while the swelling and 
the pain did go away after a short time there was one brown patch on her face which persisted for 
about six years and this was not the only physical evidence there are a couple of trees in the center 
of the field that died shortly after this incident presumably affected by the heat from this craft 
because when they were cut down it was discovered that the center of each trunk was composed of 
dark ash so it looked like they were cooked also the top branches of a walnut tree at 
one end of the field died immediately after this incident and here's what just gets even weirder 
strangely the grass below where this object hovered began to grow at an accelerated rate 
becoming much Greener and taller than in the surrounding areas twice to three times as tall 
this may sound unusual but in fact there are a number of cases involving accelerated 
growth of plants due to having been exposed to the energies surrounding these UFO craft 
so again there was an Air Force investigation there was a commanding officer Arthur Gaines Ford 
who also revealed that the location where this object had hovered showed abnormally 
high levels of radiation so word of this incident got out in the neighborhood and 
found in the days and weeks that followed hordes of sightseers showed up invading the property to 
such a degree that Eileen regretted ever having told anyone about the sighting 
but the case was very well investigated and in fact Jay Allen heineck and Dr James McDonald both 
interviewed Eileen and came away absolutely convinced of the reality of the encounter 
but for Eileen ultimately it was bad news it was just too traumatic and the aftermath was 
more than she wanted to deal with but she did certainly learn some things that we are not 
alone and it wasn't a culture that would affect her for the rest of her life as she says I can 
assure you that I will never forget one detail as long as I live even if I never see another one 
I cannot say what kept me there looking at it I just couldn't move even if I wanted to 
fortunately I am not a nervous type and I am not easily scared so perhaps that is the answer it 
was a terrible experience and one which I never which I hope never to endure again I think there's 
quite a lot to take away from this case which does involve one witness primarily but there is another 
witness there's also Landing traces there's animal effects there's physiological effects 
there is certainly intense interest from the New Zealand government and apparently 
an attempt at covering this event up as well as documents recently released show that they 
were not only very interested but they didn't want people to know that they were interested so a really interesting case I do wonder about the possibility of this being a reverse engineered 
craft given the way it was described can't say for sure she did see a humanoid and that's to 
me the most fascinating aspect of this case but like many witnesses she regretted coming 
forward because of the aftermath that happened from all of this but a truly amazing case 
and this next one I think is equally amazing and involves three Witnesses I call this one the UFO 
headache and as you'll see why I think that's an appropriate title this took place in karazino 
Brazil and is a very unusual case involving a landing and humanoids this case began on 
the evening of July 26 1965 when three teenage friends decided to go walk to the local movie 
theater to catch a movie but instead they caught another show or certainly one of the witnesses did 
Adelson Batista azavedo was 14 years old and he was walking with his two friends Zhao Pereira age 
14 and Nelson Vieira age 17. this was outside the city of kerosino and they had just reached 
a field at the intersection of Alexandre de Mata and David cannabarro streets which you 
can see here now they're all built up but back then there was an empty field and was at this 
intersection that they saw a glowing object descent from a cloud and hover about 1500 
feet in altitude over this field sending down a cone shaped beam of light now this object 
made a very loud buzzing noise and this really frightened both Nelson and Zhao to the point 
they ran away they thought this was a shooting star a meteor coming down but as the buzzing 
noise increased they thought it might be a swarm of these I'd either case they took off running 
but Adelson didn't he stayed and watched from the street as this object came in for a landing 
he said the object was roundish about 15 to 18 feet long approximately four and a half feet high 
and as he watched it landed about 120 feet away in the field maybe not directly on the ground because 
it looked like it was hovering perhaps three feet from the ground on a beam of light and he 
washed this for about three minutes when a second object appeared above again lighting the ground 
with its brilliant light and then landed about 20 or about 12 to 15 feet away from this other craft 
so this second craft was considerably smaller about six to nine feet long so shortly after 
the second craft landed two short figures came out of the larger craft and started walking around it 
uh Allison described these figures as being about four and a half feet tall 
wearing dark clothes dark boots on a sort of helmet that appeared to Glow 
these figures started gesturing to each other and talking in a weird sort of whistling foreign 
language with lots of s's and Z Sounds and it kind of reminded Adelson of old people talking 
so they started walking around the craft and this really intrigued Adelson because he's realizing 
at this point that these are not normal people so he decided to approach closer there was a little 
abandoned well so he crept up to that until he was about a hundred feet away from these figures 
and he crouched down behind this well as you can see Illustrated here and continued to watch 
he watched for about five more minutes after which time three identical looking figures came 
out of the smaller craft and also began talking in the same weird sort of whistling language 
now one of them was holding a glowing wand-like object in his right hand 
and he was kind of pacing back and forth as if measuring or looking for something with this wand 
while the two figures from the first craft continued to walk around their craft at least 
three times and then entered inside this point the first craft took off vertically the buzzing 
noise increased in volume considerably as it took off and went straight up and disappeared 
Among the Stars the remaining three figures remained for just a few minutes then they 
kind of bent down and climbed back into their craft which also Rose vertically and disappeared 
at this point Adelson ran to the theater and joined his friends and he wanted to watch the 
movie but he couldn't he actually said he had to leave because he now had a very strong headache 
he stopped by and got some pain reliever but it didn't help his headache persisted the next 
day so his father Gomer sindo actually took him to the doctor the doctor gave Adelson a 
sedative but it had no effect on his headache and in fact this headache lasted for about five 
days and five nights and then suddenly went away what an amazing case it's such a shame 
that adelson's friends became so frightened that they ran away otherwise we would have had three 
witnesses to see two of these cropped Landing the humanoids coming out and doing what they did 
it's such an interesting case because the witness Adelson saw these et's so close it was absolutely 
no mistaking them for normal human beings and of course he did suffer some pretty severe 
medical effects a headache following an encounter is actually not that uncommon I know of a number K 
of cases like that I'm not sure if it's just the trauma of seeing all this or exposure to perhaps 
the radiation or the energy fields surrounding these craft but it's certainly a compelling case 
that is really quite well known in its country but I don't think a lot of people know about it 
which is why I wanted to present it here today and here is another case which is equally interesting 
I call this one they were not human this is a really interesting case because it does involve 
primarily to Witnesses but really three and I love the drawing that was made of the 
ET scene in this case which is a daylight case and these Witnesses saw these two ETS perhaps three 
According to some accounts so I'm quite close up and a really interesting case which took place 
in Renton Washington this is such an unusual case it was around 7 7 30 a.m on August 13 1965 
when Mr Ryerson dropped off his two children Alan Grace age 16 and Laura Jean age 13 at 
yasna Rita's at beanfield on Russell Road where these two girls were working 
so he drove off and as he drove off he did notice two unusual looking figures walking alongside 
the road next to the bean field but he was quite distant from them so he didn't pay them too much 
attention but meanwhile his daughters Ellen Grace and Laura Jean also saw these two figures and 
decided to approach them and boy did they get a shock because as they got close they saw how truly 
unusual these figures were as they got closer and closer they saw that they didn't look quite right 
they thought at first that these figures might be humans wearing some sort of Halloween costume 
but this is August 13. it's not Halloween and as they got even closer they realized 
that these figures were not people in costumes they were quote not human both Figures were 
fairly short about five feet but had gray skin a very unusual skin because it had large pores 
both Figures were dressed in sort of grayish pants white shirts with a sleeveless purple vest 
and according to Ellen Grace and Laura Jean the first figure had almost a gnome-like appearance 
with very wrinkled skin and a funny little hat and he seemed to jump around in front of 
the first being as the girls approached and as they got right up next to these guys they could 
see that these figures their eyes were not normal they look like bulging frog-like eyes 
and the other being had this really large bulbous head and they saw what looked like veins on it 
his mouth was strange in that he held a strange sort of whistle-like object 
and their faces were also weirdly expressionless so at this point they realize that these could 
not be human and they thought that this might be too dangerous to get too close and they fled 
and when they had run about 50 feet away they turned around and saw these creatures were now 
gone they never saw a UFO but they did go to the police and reported it the police did not 
know quite what to make of this report but it did eventually find its way to UFO researchers 
but such an interesting case because no UFO was ever seen and these figures are just absolutely 
I mean I've never heard ETS described in quite that way as you can see from this illustration 
some don't think that that case was officially investigated but it certainly is interesting 
and no I don't think those were human beings dressed up in some sort of Halloween costumes 
the two witnesses the girls got quite close to these figures and fled in fear as often 
Witnesses do and yeah just a a really strange case all around and there's always another case 
I don't think people realize how many people are having these direct face-to-face encounters 
it is a lot and here is another case which I call it knocked on the window 
this is a really extensive case involving four Witnesses who yes are all young children but the 
parents believe him and there are landing traces so it's a truly interesting case which took place 
in Saint stanisla of Costco in Quebec Canada I think you'll find this case really interesting 
it was around 9pm on July 12 1968 when 12 year old Dennis Leisure looked out the window of the 
sov family home and saw it kind of glowing red object circular hovering just above a field of 
oatsun corn next to the soul house now the parents weren't home and he was alone with some other 
children so Dennis called to his friend who lived the house Paul sov Paul's sisters Nicole and Joan 
and Dennis's brother Regent and they all rushed to the window to take a look at this glowing object 
and at that point they saw another object appear and these two objects began moving 
back and forth in a real smooth manner over the field for just a few moments when one of 
them dropped down and actually landed in the Outfield only about one thousand feet away 
now Dennis had seen a UFO before one year earlier and he shouted out to the others 
that this is a flying saucer and he was very curious and a bit more Brave apparently than 
the other children because he grabbed the flashlight and went outside followed by 
all the other kids except for his brother Regent who stayed downstairs and looked out the window 
now Dennis is shining this flashlight into the field and it immediately shines upon a figure 
and they can see this figure is standing just behind the fence not far away and it was not a 
normal human this figure was under three and a half feet tall had brown skin that looked quote 
wrinkled scadius with bumps it had wide round eyes which were surrounded by wrinkles a large 
head was bald on top but they said it looked like he had black curly hair around the ears flat nose 
but the skin reminded them of a Toad's skin they didn't see any neck the head just kind of sat 
there right on the Torso very broad shoulders but this figure held up its hand and began to open and 
close it reminding the witnesses of like a baby who's trying to bring call to people or say hi 
so while this figure was sort of gesturing to the witnesses it started moving towards the barn 
this completely freaked out the witnesses they basically panicked and ran into the house 
now Dennis and Paul ran upstairs Nicole ran to the phone to call her parents 
Joanne ran to the bathroom shaking and locked the door and meanwhile a regent 
who had stayed in the house watched everything from the window and he washed this figure walk 
straight up to the house to the window he was looking out at and knock on the window pane 
so at this point he is like one foot away he was absolutely paralyzed with fear he said he couldn't 
move couldn't speak and this figure made a sort of growling sound which he said reminded him almost 
of a mowing cow at this point the creature moved back into the field and disappeared 
the children were still in a near Panic they all gathered together on the second floor and 
looked out the window and could see that this glowing red object was still there but as they 
watched it Rose silently upward moved higher and higher until it disappeared into the clouds 
now it wasn't long after this that their parents arrived home and the children told them what happened and the parents could see that their children were 
upset and absolutely believed them and in fact Mr Sobe said that he himself had seen a UFO 
now they weren't sure what to think about this creature that the kids were describing but the next day an inspection of the Oatfield where this craft had landed did show evidence 
there was a 15 foot wide circle of crushed grass which was pushed down in a whirlwind pattern 
now reporters did arrive later to interview the children and wisely they separated them 
and questioned them extensively and the reporters were very much impressed as the 
children's stories matched perfectly all of them showed genuine emotion and fear answered 
all the questions consistently despite attempts by the reporters to trap them into contradictions 
what's also interesting about this is that Dennis did have a previous encounter one year earlier 
in July of 1967. and I'll just quote Dennis leisure in his own words as he says and I quote 
I know it I am sure I saw one last year at about the same date but during the afternoon 
it had followed me during five minutes approximately 20 feet from the ground 
I was within 500 feet on a bicycle I saw the interior it was easy because the top of the 
saucer was made of glass approximately three or four inches there were three 
people one set at an end and two others at the other end they seemed small and black 
it was a round shiny saucer there was nothing below and above and it made no noise I must 
acknowledge that I was really afraid and that I am glad I did not see it anymore when I entered the 
woods to return home so what an amazing case that was with four Witnesses Landing traces very well 
researched and I find it's super interesting not only the appearance of the CT but how he behaved 
coming right up to the window and knocking on it like that scaring the poor kids out of their wits 
but certainly a fascinating case and another very interesting aspect is one of the witnesses 
Dennis had a previous encounter or a craft followed him and he saw humanoids in that one 
so I'm wondering if those two events are connected in some way it wouldn't surprise me because it's 
quite unusual to see humanoids especially twice unless you're a contactee of some kind so that 
could very well be what's going on here hard to say for sure but absolutely an important case 
and here's another one which I call I know what I saw that's a phrase I hear a lot from contactees 
and I can see why because having an encounter close up can really affect you profoundly 
this one took place in Summit County in Utah and involves the guidance family guyns the mother and 
her son are the primary Witnesses but again a super interesting case because this one also 
involves Landing traces physical evidence this next case is really quite profound it was around 4 
30 a.m one fall morning in 1972 when lennis guines woke up and saw a UFO right outside her window 
I'll just quote lennis directly as she says I turned the light on and this thing whatever it 
was went right up in the air to the top of the trees that's when it scared me I turned 
the lights back off and it went down again if hit if it hadn't gone up without a sound I may 
have convinced myself in my mind that it was just kids driving around but I know what I saw 
so lennis did the right thing she immediately got another witness she called her teenage son 
Sam over to watch he was also up at this time he had been getting ready to milk the cows but seeing 
this craft he was quite reluctant to go outside as this craft was very close only about 450 feet away 
now their dog they tried to get the dog to go outside but the dog refused he whimpered and ran inside the house to hide 
craft was hovering right above a nearby riverbed and casting down brilliant blue and yellow lights 
now their father was not there he was working the night shift but Sam knew that his father 
would be furious if the cows weren't milked on time it was quite particular about that 
but they didn't want to go outside because this craft was so close and they watched it for about 
45 minutes when Sam decided he was going to go outside and I'll just quote Linus his mother 
directly and she says my boy gets in the truck and goes over and he said he could see a doorway 
windows and shadows going in and out it was like someone was going in and out on the ground 
cows were bunched together he said and he had quite a hard time getting them out of 
the field without the dog but they did come down the road and into the Corral the cows were nervous 
and didn't give them milk they usually gave so we're seeing multiple interesting effects here 
now lettuce's daughter Mary slept through the whole incident mostly because her mom didn't wake 
her up something that both of them regretted but Mary absolutely believes her mother and brother 
especially what happened next as Mary says I don't know how a car could have gotten in there because 
it was real swampy there were no tire tracks my mom doesn't make up stories she's always been 
real Down to Earth so I really believe her and she believed even more because when the sun rose 
that morning she and her mother lennis went out to the where the craft was and they saw a 25 foot 
diameter of grass flattened in a clockwise swirl so some really impressive Landing traces here 
and as Lance says I wish to this day I'd called somebody to have this site tested to me it was 
really an experience I really think it was a small craft that had come down and was taking samples 
now this case was researched by mufon field investigator Mildred B cell was quite experienced 
has investigated a lot of cases and she absolutely came away convinced as Mildred says it sounded 
credible they weren't making a big deal of it they were inclined to sort of underplay it we 
had to find them they weren't coming forward as an attempt at publicity yeah I like that case because 
it was thoroughly researched by an experienced mufon field investigator there are multiple 
Witnesses it's got physical evidence there's a lot to learn from that case and cases like it 
are so so many involving evidence and multiple Witnesses here's another really remarkable 
case and I call this one we were frightened and fascinated and I call it that because this is a 
common reaction to Witnesses who are are both scared and also amazed at what they are seeing 
and that's certainly true in this case involving a family a small family a husband wife and child 
who watched a UFO with a humanoid right outside their home in Robesonia Pennsylvania it's a super 
interesting case it's amazing how profoundly the Witnesses are affected in these cases and that's 
certainly true of this next case which occurred around 1am on March 28 1973 when Clyde o donahauer 
woke up in his bedroom hearing a loud rumbling noise followed by a strange screeching sound 
now he immediately woke up his wife Catherine and asked her if she heard anything 
and as Catherine says I'm a heavy sleeper and I told him that I hadn't heard anything 
the point Clyde got up and looked out the window and told his wife that she had better get up and 
take a look because there was something very unusual right outside their window 
and I'll just quote Catherine directly Catherine says he couldn't believe what he was seeing and 
he wanted me to see it it looks to be sitting on a hill in a field near the house but it may have 
been hovering beyond the field I can't say how big it was because it was hard to judge the distance 
but it seemed to keep changing shape as it changed color the shape change probably was caused by the change of the lights I don't know my husband 
said that the thing lit up so brightly just before I came out that he thought it was going to explode 
so they said that this object was changing color first glowing red and then glowing green 
they quickly woke up their eight-year-old son so he could see it too and as they watched 
they were amazed to see somebody inside the object moving around 
and as Catherine says it was a black figure like a stick figure only thicker moving in the center was 
bending over and moving about it was really scary we were frightened and fascinated at the same time 
so mostly what they saw was sort of a silhouette and they watched this silhouette moving around 
inside this object for about 20 minutes at which point Clyde decided it was time to call the police 
and he got a hold of police chief Norman Brunner of Heidelberg Township who said that he would come 
right over to investigate so they continued watching this craft and were waiting for him 
to arrive when suddenly a pickup truck from a nearby dairy farm pulled out and at that moment 
the lights on the craft dimmed out and the craft itself seemed to disappear as Catherine says we 
didn't see it take off or anything it just faded out when the pickup truck turned off a dirt road 
I was so doubtful of what we were seeing I'm really pretty skeptical it was like a weird 
Apparition our son was very quiet during the whole thing and that's not like him yeah I think 
that is an important case because there were three Witnesses and as it turns out there were in fact peripherally at least other Witnesses who are seeing UFOs in that area at that time 
so I think that adds another level of credibility to their account and it certainly I think an 
interest well yeah an interesting case and here is another one and this one is from melon France 
and it's an interesting case because this person the main witness saw an E.T right 
outside the window of the factory where he was working and I call this one I felt a cold sweat 
that is of course a direct quote from the witness who was understandably very much 
shocked when he saw this E.T standing so close to him right outside the window of 
his office so it was around 6 a.m on September 12 1978 when a factory worker Julian Herman 
was in his office and observed an apparent extraterrestrial right outside his window 
this is in Milan again near iceer France and I'm going to quote the witness directly that's what I 
love about this particular case the witness Julian left a long written statement about what he saw 
as he says in his own words a few moments later I was in my guard's office while turning my head to 
my left side I perfectly saw through the window Bay of my office a human form of a size ranging 
between 1.65 and 1.75 meters five or six feet and of a green fluorescent color surrounded by 
a multitude of small scintillating green lights on his profile this human form was at some 20 meters 
from the place where I was I clearly distinguished his legs and arms which were along the body 
on the other hand I could not see the face nor even The Head and Shoulders but it seemed to me to 
see in the night like a motorcyclist or astronaut helmet that formed a Halo towards the head 
the human form stood motionless at the center of a visible luminous circle on the ground 
this circle was of a color I had never seen before and that resembled an orange yellow of 
a diameter of two meters approximately I could not tell whether the feet of this human form 
were in contact with the ground or not in the same way it seemed impossible to need to tell 
if the human form faced me or presented its back to me I felt a cold sweat in my radio set that 
was on started to crackle and to emit static noises I then rushed outside by circumventing 
the angle of the building I again saw the motionless green human form at the same place 
suddenly it disappeared on the spot suddenly like a lamp that would have been turned off 
now again this was at a factory so quite unusual he didn't see a UFO but this does involve a parent 
electromagnetic effects and the chief of the factory had said that this witness was a very 
honest person and was very much affected by this encounter well that was a single witness case 
the witness as we saw is wauschvar by the chief of the company so apparently a legitimate case 
and super interesting and here's another one that I also find interesting largely because 
the description of the the ET scene the humanoid scene is a little different than you normally hear 
I call this one two things came down this is a single witness case but apparently quite affected 
the witness really profoundly this took place in Ord Nebraska this case is quite brief but 
certainly interesting was about 2 A.M on October 9 1978 when teenager Deanne Kearns she's in was 
in 10th grade at the time of this encounter and yeah 2 A.M she saw a gray metallic disc 
hovering in the air about two miles north of the loop River Bridge which you can see here 
she said this object was about the size of a three-story house and it looked like a classic 
saucer with sort of like two dinner plates she said placed end to end with a little spire on top 
she could see several portholes this object was flashing red and green lights as she watched it 
dropped to the ground and then was back up to a height of about two to three hundred feet she 
could hear a loud buzzing noise like an electric motor and she watched this for about 10 minutes 
during which time she said two quote things came down on this yellow beam of light levitated down 
on this beam of light to the ground she said they were about five to six feet tall appeared to be 
brown or black in color with blob-like heads and what she perceived to be tentacle like arms 
so remember this is quite dark so hard to say how accurately she perceived all this 
but definitely something came down out of this object and reaching the ground she said these 
two figures she believed began to take samples of the soil and the plants this didn't go on for very 
long because shortly later they returned back up into this yellow beam of light and into the UFO 
which promptly took off and she said darted out of sight so fast it was literally gone in two seconds 
I think you'll agree the description of the humanoid scene is quite unusual but what's another 
really interesting thing about this case is how they behaved which is a way a thing we see with 
a lot of ETS and humanoids apparently collecting samples of soil and vegetation I find that super 
interesting it shows again how interested they are in all things Earth all things human 
and just an all-around interesting addition to the UFO field and here is the final case for today 
this is a really unusual case which quite surprised me because I don't think I've ever heard 
ETS behaving in this way I call this case two little men came out 
and this took place in tukuman Argentina a lot of activity in South America and Argentina certainly 
and this case is just so interesting as I said because what the ETS did this case is also brief 
but so interesting it occurred in 1990 and was investigated by researcher Pablo via rubia mauso 
was around 4 pm one afternoon 1990 when a goat herder by the name of Flores de mamani 
and her dog were walking her animal's home and suddenly she found herself unable to move 
so she couldn't move it was then that she saw a glowing spherical shaped object she said it was 
silver and covered with multi-colored lights the fact that she was unable to move before she saw 
this object shows that this is a physiological effect and not something caused by fright 
at any rate her normally very protective dog was very quiet did not react as he normally would and 
her goats also remained perfectly still as a door opened up from this spherical shaped object and 
she says two little men came out each of them wore shiny brown suits with what looked like stripes on 
them and helmets with glass visors and a small antenna coming out on top they also wore what 
looked like small backpacks or knapsacks now these beings didn't walk they sort of glided and floated 
towards Flores coming right up to her in fact one of these beings actually touched her grabbed her 
by the arm put this device around her arm which she kind of likened to a rubbery hose-like device 
and it used a syringe type instrument to withdraw blood it wasn't a syringe caused no pain at all 
and meanwhile this other figure approached the goat and began to get this milk the goat 
so this was a pretty quick encounter they got their samples afterwards the two little men 
again floated in a gliding motion back into their craft which shot away at high speed 
following this encounter later Flores did notice that the ground where this craft had 
hovered turned white the vegetation sort of looked like it had been exposed to high heat 
and in fact nothing would grow there for a very long time so that's the tucumen Argentina case 
which is interesting for a number of reasons there's physiological effects and not the main 
witness was rendered temporarily unable to move as apparently was her dog and her goats 
and yeah I've never heard of ETS coming out and milking a goat before but it I mean it does 
surprise me in some ways and others it doesn't I think it does show that the gander interested in 
all things about Earth and us the animals and the plants and so forth it's certainly a fascinating 
case as I think all of these cases are each one has something to tell us about the UFL phenomena 
the ETS visiting our planet and their agenda why they're here so many cases coming from all 
over the world all different types of ETS so much evidence Landing traces animal reactions 
medical effects the list goes on there are of course Skeptics but I really feel like they're 
just not doing their homework because anyone who takes a good long hard objective look 
at the evidence for extraterrestrial visitations I think can only come away convinced and sooner or 
later even those who don't believe are gonna get a wake-up call because this is a real phenomena 
and sooner or later the truth will come out and everyone on this planet is going to have 
to accept the fact that we are not alone simply put so that's it for today I really want to thank 
you once again for watching I hope you enjoyed it and perhaps learn something but until next time 
keep searching for the truth keep asking questions and most important of all keep having fun bye now.
