Summary:
Jun 27, 2021
There are many different types of extraterrestrials: grays, human-looking ETs, reptilians, tall whites, little blue beings, hairy dwarves and strange humanoids of all kinds. One well-known species are called praying mantis (or mantids.) These are usually described as being anywhere from six to nine feet tall, but can be both shorter or taller. Witnesses say they have an insectoid appearance much like a praying mantis or even a grasshopper, with long stick-like limbs, thin torsos, and massive dark eyes.

This video presents three separate cases, each involving a person who has had a face-to-face encounter with a praying mantis extraterrestrial. You will hear about a young married woman whose encounter was revealed during a hypnosis session. Another involving a college professor who had a missing time episode and then began having nightmares about being chased by a giant humanoid grasshopper. And a third case involving a teacher/daycare worker who encountered a praying mantis ET while out for her morning jog near her home.

What do the mantids look like? What is it like to have an encounter with a giant humanoid praying mantis? These three cases answer these questions and more. The witnesses have bravely stepped forward and revealed their encounters in the hopes of helping others who may have had similar experiences.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of UFOs in the paranormal today's episode is called three encounters with praying mantis extraterrestrials 
praying mantis is probably one of the most common types of ET's that people report to me 
i've covered a couple of other cases in some of my previous videos but the three cases that I'd 
like to cover today are all brand new and the first case I call case one they come from afar 
the main witness is a southern california woman by the name of genie she did allow me to use her real 
name but I'm only going to use her first name here and she had an amazing series of incidents 
actually which led her to the realization that she was in touch with praying mantis extraterrestrials 
and the first incident occurred in 1998. she and her husband now her ex-husband had gone out to 
dinner and they returned home watched some tv and then went to bed and at around 2 a.m genie 
woke up for a very strange reason as she says I was awakened because I had this horrific taste 
of garlic in my mouth it was as if I had eaten a complete head of garlic the whole thing raw that's 
how strong it was well if you can imagine it woke me up so I thought what in the heck is this 
genie had no explanation she hadn't even eaten garlic that evening 
she woke up looked at her husband he was sound asleep she went to the bathroom checked her 
mouth in the mirror there was nothing strange she gargled she brushed her teeth but nothing 
could get rid of this garlicky smell and she ended up just going back to bed and 
falling asleep but this is how it all started this is when she really started to question 
what was going on in her life this was not the first time that strange incidents had occurred 
to her and now looking back on her life she could count dozens of other weird incidents that 
she would call unexplained and many of these involved weird nighttime incidents during which 
strange figures would visit her and give messages to her while she was sort of in a half-sleep 
half-waking state and whenever this occurred she would write them down in a little diary that she 
kept but she didn't know quite what to make of them she did not associate this with ETs 
despite this she was developing a strong interest in UFOs she had had a lot of dreams about UFOs 
started reading books about UFOs and pretty soon had a pretty good library of UFO books 
but she never connected the dots until the year 2000 at that time she was reading the 
newspaper and saw that there was a little UFO group near where she lived 
and they were hosting a speaker a UFO investigator by the name of daryl sims daryl sims is 
of course a pretty prominent UFO investigator and jeannie decided that she would attend the meeting 
just because she was interested in the subject of UFOs she did not think she was involved 
she enjoyed the meeting very much daryl sims had a very interesting presentation 
and afterwards she approached him and told him about her experience with waking up 
and tasting this strong taste of garlic in her mouth daryl seemed to be very interested in this 
he told her he thought that it was a screen memory and he offered to hypnotize her jeannie was a little nervous about it at first but she agreed and daryl came 
to her apartment and conducted a hypnosis session and at first jeannie didn't recall anything 
she went into hypnotic trance pretty easily but seemed to be blocked and it wasn't until the very 
end of the session that something did happen she did recall something very profound that was 
related to that evening when she woke up tasting garlic in her mouth as she says and I quote 
towards the end of that session I could see myself myself standing between the bathroom and my bed 
and I saw what looked like an ant creature like a praying mantis I'm not sure I saw mostly its 
head in its face but I saw this creature shoving something down my throat I don't know if it was 
a tube or what it was I know I was fighting it it was big a lot bigger than me it scared the 
daylights out of me when I saw it there and that flash I was terrified I was trying to fight off 
this thing because it was shoving something down my throat like I said I couldn't tell if it was a tube or if it was trying to inject something down my throat or what it was but I could see 
and feel that thing going down my throat and this creature was holding me down so he it 
could do this I just felt a force holding me down so that I couldn't fight it although I was trying 
it was a brief flashback but it really quite traumatized her and daryl sims 
was very much convinced that this was a memory of an actual encounter 
jeannie was of course shocked she wondered how could something like this have happened to her and 
how long had this been going on and her first step was of course to examine her entire life and look 
for any weird happenings that might be related to this event and she didn't have to look very 
deeply there were lots of clues that something had been going on in her life for a very long time one 
early incident that immediately stood out occurred when she was about eight years old her parents had 
sent her to a six-week long camp for girls in the hollywood hills in california her and her sister 
and uh there was all kinds of fun activities for the pre-teens but jeannie didn't really want to go 
there she wanted to stay at home with her friends and one of the reasons was because she did not 
like sleeping outside she had a very deep-seated fear of sleeping outside 
and also a fear of coyotes although she had no idea where this fear came from 
thankfully there were little bungalows for the girls to sleep in however many times people would 
want to sleep outside next to the campfire and this of course made jeannie very concerned and she 
always chose to sleep inside but then one evening came where everybody all the girls decided that 
they were going to sleep out under the stars and one by one all the girls left the bungalow except 
jeannie and her little sister who refused they wanted to sleep inside and that's what they did 
jeannie was in the top bunk next to the window and her sister was in a lower bunk and sometime 
in the middle of the night jeannie was woken up by a weird disturbance it began without any warning 
suddenly there was a bright flash of light filling the room accompanied by a strong rush of wind 
and it was quite traumatic jeannie thought at first that she had actually been struck by lightning and she didn't bother to stop and investigate she 
left out of bed and along with her little sister ran outside screaming and ran to the camp
all the other girls were already asleep it was just a few hundred feet away 
at this point jeanne's memory becomes a little bit confused she remembers finding a spot and climbing into a sleeping bag and then she remembers something that 
really scared her she remembers waking up and seeing several very large coyotes surrounding 
her and glaring at her with these very cold staring eyes and her memory ends at this point 
she didn't know how to explain this incident she just knew that she was afraid of sleeping outside 
and now that she knew about this other encounter with the praying mantis she wondered if this might be connected and she contacted daryl sims who agreed to do another hypnosis session and he 
arrived at her apartment she sat down in her easy chair while daryl sims placed her under hypnosis 
and uh she was surprised how well it worked she could vividly remember going back to this 
incident reliving the whole scene as if she was really there and as she got closer and 
closer to this moment of this quote lightning strike she began to get very very anxious 
she started to shout out I need to get out of here I need to get out of here daryl had 
done hypnosis before he knew how to calm her down which he did and he continued the hypnosis session 
bringing her closer and closer to this moment and suddenly she was there and she saw 
the cause of her fear it wasn't lightning at all and as she was laying there in her bunk bed she 
woke up to see the room filling with a bright blazing light and seconds later 
two extraterrestrials began to come in through the closed window as genie says I saw four arms 
coming through the window they were long skinny arms with something like three or four fingers at 
the end of them and a real bright light behind them I ran out of the room jeannie continued 
the hypnosis session and she was very resistant at first but daryl sims was very persistent and 
led her to the next incident that she remembered where she was being surrounded by coyotes 
and uh as she came upon that memory that's exactly what she saw the only difference was the cut the 
coyotes appearance they were much larger than she remembered and all of them were staring at her 
with eyes that glowed a bright brilliant glaring blue color and that's all she could remember 
and daryl told her that the coyotes were probably another screen memory 
but it was clear to her that he was probably right these were definitely not normal coyotes 
but she ended the hypnosis sessions at this point because it was just too frightening for her and 
taken alone I think this would just be one piece of the puzzle that she couldn't make sense of but 
there were quite a few other strange incidents that she recalled one thing that she recalled 
was having lots and lots of UFO dreams pretty much her whole life as jeannie says all through my 
childhood and into my adulthood I would have the same dream over and over again and as I grew older 
i was always age appropriate in the dream and the dream was I was in a park it was nighttime 
and there were lots of people around all of a sudden the night sky filled with all kinds of 
saucers or flying machines they were filling the sky and everybody was panicked and running 
so because they were running I was running and all of these people were scared to death but I was never afraid I've had this same dream over and over 
and this was not jeannie's only e.t themed dream she had many other dreams about UFOs 
as she says I had a dream where I was fixing a meal and I was excited because I knew 
that quote the visitors were coming and I was getting ready to welcome them then shortly 
after that I had another dream that there was a mother ship hovering over my apartment 
more recently I've had dreams where I was sitting in a park at night time I was sitting in the grass 
with a person and then all of a sudden out of the sky these UFOs were coming straight at me 
in a v formation they were all identical and I said to the person sitting next to me see I told 
you they were real I told you another repetitive dream she wrote down in her diary she called it 
the star people as she says in this dream I was in a city like new york walking on the sidewalk 
and a crowd of people and out of the crowd a young man holding a big stack of newspapers came up to 
me he found me out of the crowd handed me one of the papers and then disappeared and I looked down 
at the headline of the paper in big huge black letters it said star people and that was the dream
jeannie uh in the past had always looked at these dreams as just a reflection of her interest in 
ufos and now she began to wonder if it might be the reverse that maybe these dreams were 
reflections of actual contact and the more she thought about it the more this seemed 
like the case because she was having other very strange experiences with these nighttime entities 
coming into her bedroom time jeannie was laying in bed kind of dozing when she had the distinct 
impression that a gray alien or something was standing in the doorway as she says I felt that 
there was a gray peeking into our bedroom and as soon as I opened my eyes it was gone 
then a while later I felt that there were two of them standing at the foot of my bed with these two 
at the foot of my bed it was like we were talking telepathically and they knew that I wanted to know 
what was going on what the truth of all of this was and I could hear them talking with each other 
wondering what they were going to do with me because I wanted to know so badly those were the words I heard then I opened my eyes and they weren't there 
this was all before she had gone to meet daryl sims but now aft having gone under 
hypnosis and recalled these incidents she started to really connect the dots 
and realized that she was probably in having contact with extraterrestrials on some level
one incident really convinced her that uh it was related to all of this for a period of about a 
month jeannie found that she was unable to sleep peacefully at night normally she had no trouble 
sleeping but for a month she would just toss and turn and felt like she was constantly on guard 
and then something was trying to get her as she says I'd fall asleep and find myself kicking and 
fighting and I never do this this is very unusual behavior for me this lasted about a month and then 
one night I was kicking so hard all the covers were at the end of my bed this actually happened 
towards the end of the night in a flash while I was kicking and fighting I saw myself in 
an examination room and I saw one of these creatures standing at the foot of this table 
and it was huge it looked like a mantis or some kind of animal looking thing it must have been 
seven feet tall and it was leaning over me and there was another in the background it was either 
either shorter than this one or possibly as tall but because it was standing further back I couldn't tell the size of it and that was just in a flash 
in an instant I saw that scene and I thought well this must be what I have been fighting 
that evening she began to sleep peacefully again she reverted back to her normal sleeping habits 
but again she connected all of this together and realized that she was in contact with ETs and 
it was shortly later that she underwent hypnotic regression with daryl sims 
and confirmed this following this she became very active in the UFO field she actually 
led a UFO group for a short time which she gave up eventually because it was just too much work 
but she continued to have experiences often these what she perceives to be greys would come 
into her room when she was in a quasi-sleeping quasi-awake state and they would give her messages 
and she would always write them down one phrase one message that she wrote down was very short 
it said and I quote we are trying to communicate with you but you don't understand 
other messages were more profound one time she woke up and wrote down the 
very provocative message those that come from afar will show you the way interestingly while 
jeannie does have a lot of the markers pointing towards being a UFO abductee she has never seen 
a UFO nor does she have any unexplained scars or scoop marks on her body which are typical of many 
ufo contactees but she did notice a few other symptoms on several occasions she woke up to 
find that her navel her belly button was red sore and inflamed that always puzzled her but she now 
links it to her UFO experiences probably the most inexplicable physical symptom that she had 
was fluorescence on her body after reading about this weird effect that some contactees report 
that their bodies will fluoresce under a black light she decided she would check herself with 
the black light and see if there was any evidence there and to her surprise there was and she found 
that under a blacklight the palms of her hands glowed with a bright fluorescence her friend was 
there her friend didn't have any of this jeannie went and washed her hands vigorously but still 
they glowed under a black light and glowed for the next several days before finally fading away
so while some of genie's encounters have been somewhat traumatic she 
has dealt with them as best as she can one thing that she says unnerves her is seeing other 
people's drawings of praying mantis ET's they look very familiar to her and as she says when people 
start showing me pictures of different ET's there are some that I can't look at I get goosebumps all 
over and it makes me want to throw up some of them make me cringe I can't look at them
the next case I'd like to talk about I call case 2 the giant grasshopper dream 
this is a very interesting case it occurred to a man I call tom that's a pseudonym 
and this case shows how people can have ET contact and not be aware of it for a very long time
for tom it all began with a dream the first time he had this dream tom had no reason to 
think much of it other than it was an extremely vivid and terrifying dream in this dream he says 
i am being chased around my grandparents farmhouse by a giant grasshopper 
uh he's wasn't hurt in the dream but every time he dreams this the fear of the dream wakes him up 
at the time he was just a kid around 10 or 11 but along with this dream came a dread 
phobia of grasshoppers and the dream would repeat over and over again all through childhood 
up into adulthood interestingly it was about the time that he started having this repetitive dream 
that there was another strange incident tom and his family had gone to visit his grandparents farm 
tom doesn't remember anything unusual happening at the farm itself however when they arrived home after the visit everybody was puzzled about one strange mystery 
it was one hour later than they sh than it should have been they had a missing time driving home 
none of them have ever ever heard of such a thing they didn't know what to make of it and unable to 
explain of it unable to explain it nobody made much of it and didn't know what to think of it 
meanwhile tom continued to have his very terrifying grasshopper nightmare was always the 
same and it continued right up through adulthood and his dread fear of grasshoppers also persisted 
time marched on he had ended up going to college he earned a master's degree in education 
and another in psychology he moved to florida where he became a college professor 
and it was around this time that he began to connect the dots he became interested in UFOs 
and he noticed a couple of strange things that seemed to be related to the UFO phenomenon 
as tom says and I quote I have scoop marks I have chronic sinusitis I have three dots in a triangle 
pattern on my throat a doctor looking at an mri of my sinuses said it appeared 
that I had broken my nose though I am unaware of any such injury 
in 1983 he had two UFO sightings and this is when he really began to research UFOs 
he joined afro the aerial phenomena research organization and mufon the mutual UFO network 
his interest in UFOs continued to grow to the point where he actually wrote a small UFO 
newsletter and meanwhile his terrifying dream about being traced by a grasshopper continued 
by this point he was pretty sure what this repetitive dream meant not only the dream but all 
the other signs he figured it out he connected the dots and realized there was a pretty good 
possibility that he was an experiencer a UFO abductee and he considered regressive hypnosis 
but wasn't quite ready to pursue it uh he still felt a little bit ambivalent about all of this 
and wasn't entirely sure that uh he was you know just jumping to conclusions all he had were small 
clues pointing towards the possibility that he was an experience or he didn't have any real proof 
but then came another strange incident one day tom was talking with his younger brother 
who related a strange memory involving tom that took place at their grandparents farm 
as tom says my brother recalled seeing me outside at my grandparents farm covered in grasshoppers 
his brother recalled seeing him covered from head to toe in grasshoppers all over his body that 
really raised alarm bells in tom's mind and he felt like it's probably related to his own dream 
of being chased around by a giant grasshopper and some years later tom asked his brother again 
about the dream and his brother had no memory of it he denied ever saying this to tom 
this is another clue as you may know there are often memory problems associated with 
ufo encounters and now here was tom's brother denying that he had ever had the stream 
uh but tom's sure because uh it left a very deep and vivid impression on him 
so it was this clue that pretty much convinced tom that he was in fact 
having or had an encounter with a giant grasshopper-like extraterrestrial 
and he's still considering hypnosis he hasn't done it yet but he knows enough about UFOs to 
put all the pieces together the dreams the marks on his body the missing time his sinus problems 
his brother's dream all of this comes together and he's pretty sure that he's probably a contactee 
and for now that's enough for him and as of uh yet he does not recall anything else
so the third encounter I'd like to talk about is I think the most interesting one I call this 
case three it walked upright this involves a lady by the name of eleanor that's not her real name 
and this is a very interesting account at 4 30 a.m in mid-november of 2006 eleanor began to get 
ready for her morning jog she lived in a very rural area of o'fallon illinois this is a small 
neighborhood subdivision intermingled with cornfields and swathes of forest it's a very 
pretty location with lots of greenery less than 10 miles to the south east is scott air force base 
this might be significant eleanor herself is a school teacher and a day care worker at the time 
of this incident she was in her mid-30s she has five children and to keep fit she would regularly 
take early morning jogs along with her dog through her neighborhood on this particular morning events 
began as normal she got up at around 4 30 a.m and with her dog started jogging down the street 
she turned off her street onto another street and then she turned onto a little road called 
illini drive and began to head north she was just passing fulton junior high school on her left 
on her right was a cornfield and ielini drive ended in a t-section just ahead of her onto kyle 
road she was about 200 feet approximately from the t intersection which was illuminated by a 
street light and this is when something very strange happened and I'll just let 
eleanor describe it in her own words as eleanor says suddenly my dog became alert 
she slowed her pace lifted her head and ears and locked her sight onto something ahead 
i casually looked up expecting to see an animal it was normal to come across deer coyote foxes 
or occasionally other pedestrians in the road ahead was something I couldn't make 
sense of I slowly came to a stop as I tried to figure out what I was looking at it was walking 
adjacent to the streetlight it was almost as tall as the streetlight and moving to the right 
it was very dark gray and walked upright my first thought was that someone was in costume 
doing some kind of acrobatics on stilts with extenders on their arms as I watched I could 
tell that it moved with ease and intention and that no one could make stilts bend at the knees 
and elbows it was long thin and had what looked like points for hands 
i was thinking grasshopper at first because of the jointed legs and the tips of the appendages 
and it appeared to have a kind of an exoskeleton the creature was very dark gray not quite black 
and it seemed to be all one color I decided later that it was more praying mantis-like 
its incredibly long legs were taking massive strides as its arms were held up forward and bent 
at the elbows with the forearms and hands moving up and down in a pumping motion the profile of the 
head seemed almost rectangular but wider at the top and narrowing where it connected to the body 
and as its gaze swept from side to side almost like it was looking for something on the ground 
each stride was approximately six or seven feet it covered a lot of ground in only a few steps 
it seemed unhurried and focused it did not seem to be worried about being spotted 
i did not see any clothing it looked exactly like an upright walking praying mantis 
with more insect quality to it than human so I stopped where I was and watched what I was seeing 
it was just walking down the road and I realized it was a real and solid creature living 
as it walked its legs lifted up and would reach and stretch in very long strides it was long 
dark and skinny and as it was striding its arms were moving in a pumping motion above its head
eleanor had never seen anything like this she'd never seen a UFO before aliens were the farthest 
thing from her mind and now seeing this figure she really struggled to orient herself she says my 
mind was whirling with trying to decide what to do I really thought about turning back and racing for 
home but for some reason I was more compelled to get a closer look it had not seemed to be aware of 
me and was continuing its movement down the road heading closer to the wooded and darkened section 
i slowly started running forward and I never took my eyes off the creature my dog was very alert and also watching but she did not pull on the leash or bark by the 
time I got to the corner it moved far enough into the darkness and I could no longer see it 
i knew better than to follow it into the darkness and I turned left onto my normal route 
i kept my eyes wide open for the rest of my run and every run after that I've never seen it 
again this encounter of course unnerved her and left her with all kinds of questions 
it actually completely changed her world view she had no idea that things like this existed 
uh as she says I went back to that area later in the day during daylight and I stood under 
the street light I am five foot five inches and the street light was at least three times 
my height so I know that the being was close to 15 feet tall I have never given much thought to 
aliens until this time and it has still taken me years to conclude that it was likely some kind of 
interdimensional being I compulsively wonder why I saw this 
why would it let me see it was it a mistake what am I supposed to do about it sometimes I 
never I wish I never saw it but at the same time I now have an awareness that there is something more
she did tell her family her husband and her children who were very supportive 
they didn't know what to make of it neither did did she she began doing research and did run 
across a similar account of a gentleman who also saw praying mantis about 40 miles away crossing 
the road late at night in his case he saw a praying mantis that was on all fours crossing the 
road so he doesn't know how tall it was another interesting factor to this particular account 
is that it occurred in the year 2006 only a short time after the very famous 
chicago o'hare airport sighting so this really made her wonder chicago o'hare airport was only 
about 300 miles away from her location which as the UFO flies is not very far away she 
wondered if possibly there was a connection there another thing that concerned her was that this 
incident occurred so close to scott air force base I was also intrigued by this fact 
and I immediately thought of the sighting that occurred six years earlier when a group of 
police officers across the state of illinois in this exact area tracked a triangular shaped UFO 
which actually went right along the outskirts of scott air force base directly between scott 
air force base and o'fallon illinois where eleanor lived at this time so there does seem to be other 
activity in this area but eleanor does not know if there is a connection to scott air force base 
but as I spoke with her you know I thought perhaps this was a one-off a singular event but that's not 
usually the case when someone sees ET's close up they often this is often an indicator that they've 
probably had other encounters often which start in very early childhood 
and I asked eleanor had she had any strange experiences in her childhood and she said that yes 
in fact she had she remembered seeing strange figures strange hooded figures come into her room 
when she was just a little girl this would always occur late late at night or early early morning 
she would scream call for her parents who would come running in and of course nothing would be 
there it happened often enough that her parents forbade her from waking them up any further so she 
was kind of on her own with this and she did have one really vivid memory which she recalled as the 
nightmare in which she wasn't in her room at all she was in what appeared to be a UFO presumably as 
eleanor says and I quote in this nightmare I awoke on a metal bed with a sheet pulled over my face 
i could hear what I thought were doctors discussing a very serious medical procedure 
i could see shadowy figures moving around through the sheet but I could not move I felt 
nervous but was wondering who was getting an operation and what might be going on as I lay there someone began to lift the sheet off of me there were doctors standing around my body 
with trays of metallic surgical tools the doctors seemed to be wearing something like surgical gowns 
i could not see their faces I was fully engulfed in the deepest terror knowing that 
they were going to fix me I don't know what happened next I woke up and it was morning
following this eleanor did start having some anxieties and night terrors which slowly faded 
away and ended but this was not her last unusual experience there was one incident that occurred 
in 1986 when she was a senior in high school at the time she lived in elk grove california 
and one morning she was going to school to attend a field trip a friend was driving 
eleanor was in the front passenger seat and a young preschool aged child sat in the backseat 
and eleanor was looking out of the passenger window when she heard the child sitting behind her 
gasp loudly at that exact moment a car was pulling up next to them and eleanor looked 
at the driver and she also gassed because the driver did not appear to be human as eleanor says 
i was pretty shocked to see the profile of an elongated oval shaped head it was smooth 
with minimal profile features the color was extremely pale and had a corpse like look to it 
there were just a few spriggles of hair coming from its head as suddenly as I could take this in the head slowly turned and made eye camp eye contact with me 
the eyes were dark sunken pools of black I jerked my head away and said nothing
this shook eleanor up pretty badly it was clear that this figure whatever it was was 
not human and she didn't know what to make of it she didn't think e.t at the time but now she 
wonders if perhaps this was some sort of strange hybrid and uh other strange experiences followed 
she grew up she became an adult she moved to oath found illinois and in 2006 had that strange 
praying mantis encounter but it was about five years later she was out jogging in 2011 
when she had another strange encounter she was again jogging with her dog a different 
dog and went off illini drive turned left onto kyle road and had just turned left 
there's a massive water tower being constructed on her right and again it was her dog who noticed 
something strange first her dog suddenly became very excited about something up ahead 
and she assumed that it was going to be an animal or another person and about 25 feet ahead of her 
she saw something crawling across the road and it was this weird foggy looking kind of thing 
she knows it wasn't normal fog because it was very concentrated as she says and I quote this 
was a concentrated ball of illuminated mist it was distinctly round and compacted and seemed to 
be illuminated somehow it was about three feet tall and had tendrils of mist that looked like 
octopus legs rotating up and over from behind the ball and moving itself forward in a rolling motion 
my dog was excitedly pulling me forward and even though it was insanely weird I did not feel scared 
about it and hurried to get closer and as it moved up to the grassy area of the schoolyard 
it began to slowly fade and vanished by the time I got closed 
it was one year later in 2012 that eleanor had her first UFO sighting looking at her backyard 
she saw a large gold golden colored orb hovering over her neighbor's house she quickly called out 
her daughter who also saw it and it hovered there for quite some time before finally moving away
and she continued to have encounters it was two years later in 2014 she had a very 
strange encounter while visiting the sam's club department store 
she was actually in line and looking ahead of her in line she was surprised to see a very strange 
looking figure uh she appeared to be female as eleanor says her head was oblong pale 
and mottled with veins she had a few spriggles of hair I wasn't really thinking but as she slowly 
turned around she made eye contact with me and she had dark pools of blackness for eyes I jerked 
my head away as I felt ashamed for inadvertently staring the store doors opened and I looked back 
just a moment after the eye contact and she wasn't there it seemed that she had vanished
what was really strange is not only the appearance of this being but how quickly it disappeared it seemed to disappear much more quickly than just walking away eleanor 
does not know what to make of this sighting and again wonders if this could perhaps have been 
a hybrid ET that was showing itself to her on purpose she doesn't know but it was shortly after 
that she moved out of elf o'fallon illinois and that was her last really unexplained experience 
but there was one weird thing that did happen shortly before moving out of this home in o'fallon 
she and her husband had invited a couple over and the husband of this couple was a retired air force 
officer who had actually worked at the nearby scott air force base and normally 
eleanor does not talk to anyone about her 2006 sighting of a praying mantis e.t 
but for some reason she found herself telling this guy a colonel the whole story and uh after 
telling the story the air force officer seemed to be very awkward and uncomfortable as eleanor says 
they sat in quiet quiet silence as I regretted my mistake when I finished they were quiet after a 
few moments he told me he didn't believe in that kind of stuff seemingly hesitant he proceeded to 
tell me that he had worked with the guy at scott that lived somewhere along kyle road who told him 
that weird things happen over on kyle road I know he didn't mean weird stuff like cops and robbers 
sort of things by the way he said it I asked if he could tell me exactly what and he said no
and that was the last of that so eleanor uh is ultimately happy that she's had these 
weird experiences she feels that they've enriched her life and enlightened her to what is truly out 
there but it was her encounter with a 15-foot tall praying mantis that impressed her the most that 
was actually why she contacted me because she had heard of she had read another encounter involving 
a praying mantis in one of my books and in that encounter the praying mantis was also 15 foot 
tall I would call this an outlier most of the praying mantis type cases are usually 
they're eight maybe nine feet tall but in her case she's insistent she's absolutely 
sure that this figure was 15 feet tall as she says it was a 15 foot tall praying mantis man 
striding down the street early one morning while I was out for my run it has definitely changed my life in my perception about what exists here and in other places
so that's it those are the three praying mantis ET encounters that I wanted to share with you 
i covered jeannie noble's case in my book inside UFOs the other case involving tom and the strange 
grasshopper dream and eleanor's case with the 15 foot tall praying mantis are both in my new book 
wondrous 25 true UFO encounters so you can read more about what happened in that book but yeah 
these cases show that there does appear to be praying mantis visiting our planet and again 
this would be probably among the most common certainly next to grays and human looking ETs
of the type of vt that people tell me about it's not unusual and eleanor's description 
matches perfectly what I've heard from other people as well as for that matter 
tom's description and genies so that's it for today I hope you've enjoyed this episode I 
really appreciate you watching thank you very much and until next time keep having fun
you
