Summary:
Sep 6, 2024
Seeing a UFO is an incredible experience. But far more shocking is having a very close encounter with a humanoid extraterrestrial. When someone has very close face-to-face contact, there is no chance of misperception. It is an undeniable experience that instantly changes a person’s worldview. This video presents ten shocking cases of people who have had direct contact with UFO occupants. The cases span from 1923 to 2012, come from across the planet, and involve a wide variety of humanoids. These cases are supported by multiple eyewitness testimonies, radar returns, photographs, landing traces and more.

UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS. One summer morning in June 1923, ten-year-old Norman Wilson Massie went outside his home in Mount Erie, Illinois to check on the family’s horses. To his shock, he came upon a landed UFO with five little blond men, each about four feet tall. They rushed back and forth, apparently repairing their craft. After five minutes, the craft flew away. Norman told his family, but nobody else for many years.

MANY SURPRISES AWAIT TERRESTRIALS. It was a summer morning in 1945 when nine-year-old I. Chebotaryov went fishing along the shores of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov, Russia. He was about to return home when a silver craft dropped from the sky and landed in the water just off shore. A silver-suited humanoid exited and approached the witness, saying that he came from another planet, and invited the witness to come onboard.

HUMANOIDS VISIT A NAVY SHIP. In 1952, the USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt aircraft carrier had the first of what would be ten separate visitations by UFOs. This first encounter involved a metallic disk, as did a second and third encounter in 1956. In 1958, Navy officer Chester Grusinski was on deck when another craft appeared, and through the portholes he and many others saw alien figures looking down at them. The event was covered up as were the previous and future encounters.

THE DOCTOR AND THE ALIEN. On August 26, 1966, Dr. Juan Jose Rivera was driving his motorbike near Punta Carnero, Spain when he saw a monkey-like figure wearing a jumpsuit float across the road ahead of him. He chased it down a hill to a landed flying saucer. He snapped one quick photograph before fleeing the scene in panic.

THE HUMANOIDS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. At 10pm on January 29, 1967, Enid Campbell looked out the window of her home in Knox City, Missouri to see a white spherical-shaped object approach her home and hover in her backyard. Looking inside, she saw two beings wearing “shiny silvery wetsuits.” She alerted her two children who also saw the craft. Afterward, they found burned vegetation in the backyard.

UFO AND HUMANOIDS LAND BY A TRAIN. On April 20, 1967, several railway employees riding past the Casalegno Station in Argentina were shocked to see a strange craft with multicolored lights and tiny three-foot-tall humanoid alongside the railroad tracks. They slowed down the train and watched in shock as these beings moved hastily around the craft. They discovered that an earlier train had also seen the UFO.

WE DID NOT LOOK BACK. At 3am on September 30, 1968, two young men were walking along a rural road near Roncenay, France when a glowing red UFO flew across the sky ahead of them. Coming around a corner, they saw that the craft had landed and two little humanoids were floating around it, shining flashlights on the ground. Then one of the humanoids approached to within 15 feet. The men fled in fear.

ROCK COLLECTING ALIENS. Around dusk one evening in 1976, nine-year-old Hercilio da Costa was walking to her home in rural San Goncalo do Amarante, Brazil when she walked right up to a landed UFO. Seven human-looking figures in dark jumpsuits stood around it. One was collecting small stones and putting them in a sac. When one of the beings spoke, Hercilio fled in fear. Later, landing traces were found.

THE FLOATING HUMANOID. At 1:30 am on December 30, 1979, Sebastiano Pannitteri woke up in his home in Sicily, Italy to his dog barking and his bedroom filling with light. Rushing to the window, he was awestruck to see a short humanoid dressed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, floating in his yard. It remained there for five minutes before gliding away and disappearing behind a wall.

TWO ALIENS ABOVE SECOND STREET. On the night of May 25, 2012, six people in two cars were traveling west on Highway 7 in Clinton, Missouri when their journey was interrupted by an unusual sight: a large craft with glowing portholes was hovering just above 2nd Street. The witnesses were frightened to see two skinny humanoids looking out the window. More sightings soon followed.

So many cases of humanoid encounters! These ten cases may be shocking, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. These kinds of events are much more common than most people know. And they have lots to tell us about what’s out there beyond Earth. Are we ready to learn?

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's episode
is called very close encounters with humanoids 10 Shocking True cases got
some really amazing cases for you today stretching all the way back to 1923 and
up to 2012 and these cases of course come from all over the world I've got cases from
France Italy Spain Russia the Caribbean Argentina and
Brazil and three cases from the United States and as always a wide variety of
humanoids short little guys quite tall ETS human looking ETS strange humanoids
of all kinds really and of course supported by some really amazing
evidence in these cases some involve photographic evidence radar returns
Landing tra es and more so really undeniable evidence these are the kinds
of cases I think that do have something new to offer in terms of our
understanding of extraterrestrial contact and I think they're just darn
fascinating so I do have a lot of cases to cover today let's get started first
case I want to talk about today I call a UFO lands for repairs I like this case because it
occurred very ear early in terms of UFO history June of 1923 it occurred in Mount Erie Illinois
and yeah it's a very early case and one of very few in which people report that
a UFO is apparently Landing for repairs it's also very interesting because of
the type of ET described and the witness himself is quite credible the witness in
this case is Norman Wilson Massie and a good Witness as I said he grew up to be
a teacher a basketball coach a school principal his encounter did occur way
back on a warm summer morning in June of 1923 when he was only 10 years old and
I'll just let Norman describe in his own words what happened as he says I opened
the gate to let the horses into the pasture I looked back down the field and
there was an object with lights all around it I kept walking closer to the object until I got about 50 feet away I
stood there and watched the five men who were on board the machine was metallic
and stood on three legs the top was a dome with holes in it the best way I
could describe the top was it looked like melted glass I got close enough
that I could hear them talk one guy sat in a chair and the others called him the
commander four others made trips back and forth forth in the ship I didn't
know what was going on until the end then one of the crew members told him
that the repairs had been made so Norman watched all of this for about 5 minutes
the beings he said had blonde hair and were no more than 4T tall but looked
pretty much human then without warning the craft rose up the three Landing legs
telescoped back into the bottom section of the craft which rose vertically about
200 ft and then accelerated away as fast as a bullet to the West now Norman immediately ran inside
and told his parents Grover and lo Laura and his brother Floyd Lair what had
happened and they were all skeptical they thought initially he was making up the whole thing and as Norman says Mom
and Dad tried to convince me that I really hadn't seen anything and was making up the whole thing now his dad
said not to tell anybody anything as they might think Norman was quote crazy
in the head or an idiot so Norman listened to his parents and ended up
keeping this encounter secret for most of his life but decades later in 1990
now in his 70s he found the courage to share his encounter with his son Jerry
who was actually a colonel in the Air Force at the time and his son was surprisingly not at all surprised as
Norman says when I got done telling him the whole story he told me that there
was nothing wrong with me that the Air Force files are full of pictures of UFOs
he accepted the story as the truth it doesn't bother me one bit that people might think I'm a crazy old man in my
own mind in my own heart it existed and I saw it with my own two eyes certainly
a very unusual case and yeah when the witness is a teacher a school principal
he's very well-respected he kept his experience secret for so many years I
find his testimony quite compelling and the fact that it occurred so early
1923 If This Were A later case I might be persuaded to think that this could be
a reverse engineered case but way back in 1923 I don't know and the fact that
these ETS are described as three foot 4ot tall
humanoids certainly doesn't sound like normal people it's a really amazing and
unusual case and now we move to another one that's equally unusual and also
quite early this one I call many surprises await
terrestrials and this case occurred in the summer of 1945 in tangaro Bay this is in the sea
of aav in Russia don't hear a lot of cases coming out of this area but there are tons of them this is a single
witness case like the previous one but very unusual I like it because the
witness had quite an interesting interaction with this alleged ET the
researcher of this very unusual and early case is Alexi K primia he's the
author of UFO witnesses to the unknown and this case was also present presented
by Albert Rosales in his book humanoid encounters again it is a single witness
Case by a 99-year-old boy known only as I
chiov it was a summer day in 1945 and the witness was fishing for his family
in the tarog bay this is located on the east side of the Sea of of azaz in the
rostov area of Russia he had filled his bucket with fresh fish after fishing for a while and
was about to return home when suddenly he says an object that looked kind of
like a quote giant plate descended from the sky and dove into the water with
such speed and force that the witness was actually soaked by the water he said
this object was 15 ft wide composed of shiny metal and it came to rest on a
sandbar several feet offshore away from the witness immediately a series of
bubbles emerged from the water surrounding the craft and suddenly a quote man came out of the desk jumping
from out of the top and he immediately began to approach the very surprised witness to a distance of about 20 ft the
winess had no fear he said that this figure was dressed in a silvery overall
he wore a Dark Helmet which covered his head completely on his back he wore a can
shaped object which looked kind of like tinted glass he also had a small sack
hanging from his chest area and was holding what looked like a blue stone in one of his
hands so the two of them stood there looking at each other in complete silence for about a full three minutes
so curious the witness finally asked the being speaking in Russian do you come from the Moon the being paused for a
long moment then replied also in perfect Russian no I am from another
planet so the witness then asked what is the name of your planet there was another long pause and the ET apparently
ignored this question and said instead many surprises await
terrestrials and they will be happy for them so the boy continued to ask questions and he said please tell me
about your planet and the ET pointed to the disc in
the water and said if you want come into my ship and soon you will be in my
Planet so the witness considered this offer but then he thought of his family and became concerned about what would
happen if he didn't return so he told the ET I do not want to fly with you and
I want to go home my mother waits for me there he pointed to his bucket of fresh
fish and said we are going to eat fried fish for dinner and the being's response was it's
a Pity that you do not want to come and then he turned around and walked back to the craft at this point the witness did
notice that this being was actually Barefoot had long feet with long toes that looked pretty much human-like but
before entering the craft the being did have one more message for the witness informing him that the witness could
tell people about the encounter but that nobody would believe him he then climbed
back into the craft which rose briefly then re-entered the water the witness
took his bucket and went home and of course later spoke with researchers and that's
how we found out about this case that case definitely does have some unique elements and yeah the witness was a
child and this occurred quite some time ago there's no real physical evidence to
support it it's purely anecdotal but apparently was investigated by a
researcher and you can make up your own minds about it but it's definitely fits the pattern we see in so many other
cases it's a shame that the witness did not take the invitation to go on board the craft this might have been a very
different story but certainly I think an important contribution to the UFO
field and now we move to the next case which is by far my favorite in this compilation a really important case you
may have heard of it probably haven't heard the whole story though I call this one humanoids visit a Navy ship this
actually occurred over a period of many years but the main incident occurred in October of
1958 in the Caribbean Sea this is not far away from Cuba it's a really
compelling case involving photographic evidence many many witnesses radar
returns and it deserves to be far far more well known than it is this case has
been investigated by John Bowman who wrote about it but primarily the
investigation is done by the witness himself he is a Navy officer by the name
of Chester guzinski who is assigned aboard the USS aircraft carrier Franklin
D Roosevelt which by the way and this could be important was the first carrier
to hold nuclear weapons this is a large ship it had a crew of about 3,000
people but as it turns out it's also a major UFO magnet with a total of at
least eight or 10 10 UFO encounters the first that's known about
took place in 1952 after the FD left Portsmith the witness was an Electronics
technician by the name of John S Lawrence who says and I quote one night
I was in my bunk reading when my compartment buddies who were outside called for me to come out quick they
pointed an object out to me that was in the sky it looked like a very bright star that moved in an erratic pattern
accelerating very rapidly it would stop for a short period of time and again
accelerate ve very rapidly and again stop we followed the object across the
sky with the same start stop action and not in a straight line until we lost it
in the light of the Moon which was just starting to come up to this day I am not
sure what we saw now of course he was not the only witness reportedly many photos were
taken by a journalist who was on the deck at the time another sighting took
place when the ship was off Rio de Janeiro in Brazil this was on July 26
1956 when as Chester ginski says two disc objects were suspended in midair
they were over one another they had two rows of counter rotating lights the
upper desk released a fireball object that dropped into the top of the lower now the main witness in this case
was petty officer third class Leon Treadwell who says that he was actually
forced to sign a 20 yearlong non-disclosure agreement and I'll just
quote Leon Treadwell directly because he describes his experience in detail as he
says these objects were seen by me as well as several dozen others including
officers while crew members of the carrier Franklin D roosevel the time was
in the early morning hours of July 26 1956 while at anchor in the port of Rio
De Janeiro Brazil most of the crew were asleep and unaware of the sightings as
members of cic radar division these objects were watched through high power
binoculars for several minutes before they finally vanished with tremendous
speed when first cited the objects were suspended in midair over one another
with 700 feet between them a radar fix placed them several miles from the FDR's
position at a height of about 2,000 ft two rows of bright counter rotating
lights could be seen through the middle of each object that made them appear to be round in shape for several minutes
they never moved then the upper One released a fireball object that dropped into the top of the lower one within
seconds they both vanished with tremendous speed speed radar contact was almost impossible was estimated the
objects could have been between 75 and 100t in length all involved were told to
keep a tight lip on what we saw a report was filed signed and sent to the defense
department along with a color sketch by me of what was watched that night by
many and there were more cases one month later around July 25 to 27
1956 Chief Warrant Officer John C how witnessed what he described as a
cigar-shaped object which was not only visually seen But tracked on radar and
again I'll just quote the witness directly as John says in his own words as I recall the signal Bridge was
called by combat information center asking for visual verification of an air
search radar contact in our vicinity holding stationary inspection revealed a
cigar-shaped object estimated to be at 5,000 ft close by the Zenith it was
displaying at least one row of white lights I do not remember if any were flashing after about 10 or 15 minutes it
suddenly started moving in a Northerly Direction accelerating smoothly and rapidly until it disappeared from view
in one or two minutes it may have disappeared more quickly than that as
cic later said it went off their radar scope in two or three
sweeps the incident was reported to the officer of the deck and I am sure to the
commanding officer Captain John T Hayward The Sting was certainly
noteworthy enough to have been logged both in the cic watch officer's log and the smooth deck log copies of the latter
would be available from the ship's histories Branch Naval Historical Center in Washington Navy Yard Washington
DC here's where it gets interesting because a later examination of the ship's logs showed that both of these
events had been removed or blacked out now perhaps the most interesting
Encounter of all on the Franklin delanor Roosevelt is the sighting by Chester
guzinski he was only 18 years old at the time and serving as a fireman's
Apprentice the ship was in the Caribbean near Cuba was about 10 p.m. one evening
in 1958 and this is when Chester first noticed something was out of the
ordinary he was below decks and suddenly a number of seamen started hurrying up
to the flight deck as Chester says I was down below when I was told to go topside
to see something strange so I went up and I couldn't believe my eyes I saw a
bright white ball of light there was a small light that was following our ship
it headed straight for us getting bigger and brighter the light came right at us
it was spherical approximately 75 to 100 ft long it turned red orange and I could
feel the heat on my face now at this point all the ship's Maneuvers immediately stopped dead
Chester could see at least 25 other officers also watching this object which
was now moving in a sort of wobbling fashion you could see now that it was actually sort of cylindrical shaped or
cigar shaped said it moved directly towards the ship only stopping when it
was a few hundred feet away and now he could clearly see a row of squarish
Windows each glowing with an orange light as this was occurring the man on the bridge watch was yelling into the
intercom for the deck officer to get up on deck on the double meanwhile Chester
was amazed to see what looked like human figures of some kind looking down at him
from this row of square Port holes lining the circumference of the craft as Chester says it came in close enough to
us so you could see the shape of the object and also see that there were figures inside it I could see
silhouettes of figures looking at us they had no features but you could tell
they weren't human the impression I got was that those Figures were not human I
was kind of shocked because I was wasn't expecting something like that then the bottom turned cherry red and it vanished
in a Flash so per Chester one of these beings was sort of leaning against the glass
and appeared to be looking down at the witnesses while the other could only be seen from the neck up but before this
object left both of these figures appeared to move away from the windows and the whole incident lasted only about
2 to 5 minutes but things weren't over yet the
next day Chester says he felt strangely dehydrated had to drink a lot of water
the first thing he did was check the ship's quote plan of the day this is a new
sheet uh and he was looking to see if there was any mention of the incident
not surprisingly there wasn't anything a few officers asked him about it but he
decided to deny the incident he asked other people they didn't know anything
but it turned out his decision to deny the incident turned out to be a pretty wise decision because Chester says that
shortly after this encounter any crew members who had talked about the
incident were transferred the CIA came on board to investigate a so-called quote gambling
problem this is apparently a coverup because as Chester says it was a massive
cover up there was no gambling now it it's even weirder because several months
later in 1960 Chester still on duty he accidentally cut his finger and had to go under
anesthesia to have it stitched up and he says that as he was coming out of
anesthesia a doctor was actually questioning him about the incident he's
not sure exactly what he said in response but later while recovering he
was asked more questions about this sighting but he denied seeing anything
now there was more counters in 1963 another major sighting occurred radar
officer Harry a Jordan who you can see here was a witness he was interviewed
directly by Chester ginski and in fact in 1998 Harry Jordan
spoke before the US Senate's UFO hearing he stated that after a UFO was
detected on radar Phantom F4 BS were launched in an attempt to intercept it a
20 minute long Chase ensued finally the Jets returned to the ship at the time
they had actually chased this apparent craft about 600 mil away and then they
landed back on the FDR and in a matter of about 1 second the UFO darted back
and flew right over the ship so here is a little quote from Harry Jordan as he
says I detected a very large UFO during my midwatch on radar off the coast of s
inia in late 63 I provided the Senate intelligence committee with an affidavit detailing my
experience during this particular Cruise there were several photographers on board to document the NATO Fleet
operations they were present on board the night of my contact on radar I was
told in no uncertain terms to keep my mouth shut for 20 years but what I
experienced that night will never be forgot gotten so the FDR was eventually
decommissioned in 1977 and one year later in 1978 was sold
for scrap metal but Chester ginski could never forget what happened to him years later
he decided to step forward publicly with his sighting and he began to talk to other former crew members and soon
learned that the ship had experienced multiple visitations by UFOs he
single-handedly opened up a huge can of worms and discovered that there was in fact a coverup of UFO events that have
taken place on the FDR he interviewed many of the other Witnesses got written statements and
letters from them describing these many encounters it was he who found out that
the ship's logs had been purged of any information regarding these cases he did
file requests with the Freedom of Information Act all of these proved
fruitless as Chester says the Freedom of Information Act requests
to the Navy Department the CIA and the NSA did not produce any
information why all of those sightings from one Navy ship the USS FDR was the
first Navy aircraft carrier that was allowed to carry nuclear weapons and this was including the
hbomb so I think that's a significant factor here we do know UFOs are very
much attracted to anything involving nuclear material in any capacity they're
very concerned about this we know this from firsthand contact te reports so Chester worked hard to
publicize this story and it did get quite a bit of attention it was featured in UFO magazine later on the TV program
sightings but even today he's still searching for information about this and is still suffering backlash from coming
forward as he says I get teased about this all the
time but this whole series of events continues to be covered up and as Chester says I just want the truth to be
known in fact he's currently working on a screenplay about all of this called out of the sky man oh man that case that
series of events is so important and I think really cements the fact that ETS
are very concerned about our use of nuclear weapons I think that's probably why the this ship was visited so many
times I really feel for the witnesses especially Chester grusinsky not for him
we probably wouldn't even know about these events and yet he's been able to gather together many witness
testimonies so it's an undeniable event with radar returns photographs uh some
of these Witnesses testifying before Congress it's really incredible and I'm surprised it's not more welln it
honestly should be front page news and it's not and we can blame our own
governments for that fact this coverup has had a devastating effect on the progress of euphology it simply can't go
on it's why I do this research the subject is very important and everyone
deserves to know the truth about what's going on here so yeah a really amazing
case and I bet there are many many more like it and now we move to another case
which is not very well known but certainly deserves to be I call this one the doctor and the Alien and what a case
this is this occurred on August 26 1966 this is in Punta carero Spain and I
like this case for a number of reasons the main witness is a medical doctor and
he had a very close encounter with a very unusual humanoid but apparently was
able to get an incredibly clear photograph graph of this
UFO so that alone makes this case quite important now this humanoid encounter
case comes from researcher Jose Antonio kavaka the main witness is a
gynecologist Dr Juan Jose Rivera he was 26 years old at the time of his
encounter this is 5:00 p.m. August 26 1966 he had decided to take a ride on
his motorcycle in the Punta Caro area he was planning on taking pictures of The
Straits of Gibralter and also collecting fossils now suddenly he became aware
that the environment around him was unnaturally silent there were no insect
sounds no sounds of wind no sounds of the waves from the nearby ocean no rustling rustling of branches nothing
and he had a very distinct feeling that something unusual was about to happen
and he was right cuz immediately he was shocked to see what he first thought was a monkey crossing the road in front of
him but it clearly wasn't a monkey as it appeared to be floating and it was
dressed in a skintight jumpsuit of some kind it was dark in color about 4 feet
tall it had a bulging head he said a small chin its face was pretty much
humanlike but had very large round black eyes this figure had very long arms
which it held rigid and unmoving against its body as it made these weird floating leaps across the road he said these arms
almost reach the ground he did see what looked like wristbands and ankle bands
on its arms and legs so he watched this figure disappear to the brush on the
side of the road he immediately jumped off of his motorcycle leaned it up against a tree and chased this being and
boy was he shocked when he followed it to this clearing where he saw an object
landed about 60 ft away he said it was roughly saucer or oval-shaped 45 to 50
ft long it had two sort of fin-like protuberances on the back side of it he
said he saw a doorway what looked like a clear glass-like Dome on top of it and
I'll just quote him directly as Juan says it was there in a small Valley
where there was a piece of land cleared of trees and undergrowth it was metallic matte grayish in color and at the back
which was the best part there was a door similar to those in chops with a shutter
closure the edges standing out it also had two pointed protrusions at the back
like those on some American cars of the time at the top of the front there was a kind of transparent cabin that I think
must have been the bridge of command of that device I cannot be sure if it was resting on the ground or floating a
short distance from the ground now Juan was a amateur
photographer he always carried a camera with him and seeing this strange craft he immediately pulled his camera up and
snapped a quick photograph and he says it was weird because at that exact
moment he felt a quote tremendous fear that penetrated him to the
bones so he fled the area in a panic however he did later return to
search for evidence of it couldn't find any evidence of it this Photograph did come out and
researcher Jose Antonio kavaka says that this is probably one of the best
photographs in eological history the winess himself regarding the photo says it looked perfect it was just
a little bit blurry but you could see that thing perfectly in full color keep
in mind that whatever it was took up almost the entire slide out of fear and
because of my position I showed it to very few people so this encounter really had a
profound effect on the witness in fact he did have some memory problems surrounding the whole event as the
researcher Jose kavaka says and I quote he tells me that he has serious problems
remembering everything that happened that afternoon he has blackouts he says
that this has not happened to him with anything else throughout his life is one of those cases that seems to have
no explanation that persists even after years these are events that have
remained latent in the history of euphology in our country and we could consider that it is probably one of the
most important eological incidents that have taken place in our
geography so the witness has agreed to very few interviews he kept quiet about
the incident for many years but as he says I have no idea what it could have
been I have no answers and I have thought about it a lot that this was not
from this world I am sure of that look the first strange thing that happened was that silence you couldn't hear the
cicas in the field or the wind nothing that was very strange and look suddenly
that thing appeared about 2 m away I can't forget it it's in my head and I
remember it as if it were yesterday now later he would have some other sightings of UFOs but nothing
compared to his encounter with that strange humanoid and the landed craft what a fascinating and unique case that
is with this doctor having such a close interaction running up to this landed
UFO apparently getting a photograph of it it's very well researched and like
many witnesses he kept it secret for quite some time to me that always argues
for the authen icity or The credibility of a case because these are not people
who are seeking attention by any means I mean this doctor refused most interviews
doesn't want to talk about it they're not making any financial gain from it and they're so so many cases like these
so yeah an important and certainly really interesting case and now we move
to another case which I call the humanoids outside the window this occurred on January 29
1967 in Knox City Missouri the show me state and yes the UFOs definitely showed
up I like this case for a number of reasons it's got multiple Witnesses it
was thoroughly researched there are landing traces as well it's a very close-up encounter and a really
fascinating described UFO and humanoids as well this very interesting case comes
from esteemed researcher Ted Phillips he's considered the leading expert in
UFO landing traces and he did include this case in his book physical traces
associated with UFO sightings was around 10 p.m. on the evening of January 29
1967 as Enid Campbell sat in her home outside of the very small town of Knox
City Missouri looking out the window she saw this bright object which she thought
for a brief brief moment was the full moon but as it moved closer she realized it was something quite different it was
a spherical shaped craft of some kind it was white in color reminding her kind of
of a semi-transparent frosted light bulb and it had this shiny gold colored
horizontal ring around the center which had numerous little holes in it she said it was quite large about
quote two stories high so about as big as a house and she said it was totally
silent she watched in absolute amazement as it approached to within several feet
of her window right over her backyard and then came to a stop just above
ground level and inside through the semi-transparent surface she saw
something amazing two occupants who were wearing quote shiny silvery wet suits
she could see one sitting in front of what she said looked like a control panel of some kind with a lever on top
the other appeared to be standing so Enid immediately called out to her two teenage Sons Jean age 18 and George age
14 they both ran up to the window just in time to see this object rise up and
start to move away and as it did so all three of them saw two smaller luminous
spheres approach the larger object and enter through an opening near the lower
ledge so apparently it was there to examine something hard to say for sure
but the object then emitted what looked to them like Jets of red fire out of these little holes lining the gold
colored band around the circumference the object then ascended vertically and moved off into the
distance and was gone now later the next day it was
discovered that the snow on the ground beneath the area where the object had hovered was completely melted and also
the pathway that the object had taken as it approached the house this area failed
to grow any plants whereas elsewhere all the plants continued to grow normally so
some pretty good Landing traces there you go another case that's really hard to deny I mean when you have three
Witnesses and there's Landing traces and they see an object in humanoids that close I mean right in their backyard
there's no real chance of misperception in cases like these thoroughly
researched and I mean it's just amazing to me that we still have Skeptics
because if you can you know disregard one case or two but we've got thousands upon thousands upon thousands of these
cases occurring all over the world to ignore them would be purely
unscientific and here's another case which is really quite compelling not very well known I call this one UFO and
humanoids Land by a train this is another multiple witness case this
occurred on April 20 1967 near caleno
Argentina and it's a pretty fascinating case in terms of the shape of the UFO
and the tiny little humanoids that were surrounding it the Witnesses in this next case are several Railway workers uh
it was around 3:30 p.m. on April 20 1967 that they had a very close encounter
with an apparent landed UFO and humanoids they were traveling by train
they had just passed the casalegno station in Argentina and were heading in the direction of the galves
station one of the witnesses the main witness his name is Enrique R galber
he's an engineer he noticed what he first thought was a house on fire off
the side of the tracks so he immediately slowed down his train just in case
assistance was needed as the train did carry fire extinguishers but as he got closer he
realized no this was not a house on fire and said it was something much stranger
it looked like an object covered with brilliant multicolored lights as Enrique says I stopped the
train to carefully watch what was happening there with my companion Mr Enrique Certo we could see at a distance
of approximately 120 M something thing we could not Define but yes we observed
calmly without losing detail it was a metal apparatus Square shaped about 3 m
Square as high with a number of Windows in three rows all around
it so it was quite oddl looking they couldn't quite identify it this object
had what looked kind of like a spinning wheel in front which was filled with colored lights the craft itself was
sending down beams of light to the ground but most amazing all around the craft
they saw very small beings very small maybe about 2 feet in height Enrique
estimates they were wearing gray uniforms did not appear to have anything on their heads they were caring what
Enrique assumed was some kind of weapon on their shoulders but he couldn't see clearly enough to tell for sure the
other witness Enrique Certo was also struck by the strangeness of the object
he says he never saw anything like it and he did verify that there were figures as he says I saw a light and
people moving around it three or four as human beings with two legs and two normal arms a bit Hasty
movements now he wasn't sure what they were looking at he said it looked kind of like a box on fire but as he says all
I saw was the backlight and moving people he hesitates to call this an
actual landed UFO and extraterrestrial s he's a bit more conservative in his
interpretation of what happened than Enrique galimberti but definitely verifies the
whole incident at this point Enrique galimberti decided to blow the Train's whistle to see if he could elicit any
response from these beings but when he did there was no response now they found out something
interesting cuz Enrique talked to the crew of a train that had passed this location about 50 minutes earlier and he
learned that they had also seen this same craft in the same position one of the train crew members
was Salvador pomidoro he was on the earlier train and he says that he saw
quote a reddish thing like an oven burning bricks well it was a freak thing
on earth I was struck by the color so red like a fire it looked like a square
about a meter and a half or so now his train was a freight train and move quite
slowly so they were able to watch this object for about 10 minutes they did not stop or slow down and he says he could
not see any other detail than this fiery red glow he did not see any humanoids so
perhaps I'm speculating here he saw when it had just landed and the later train
saw the humanoids very hard to say for sure but it's absolutely an unusual
incident I think you'll agree that's a pretty interesting in case not a whole
lot of information to it but yeah multiple Witnesses I also like it because it's one of many cases where
UFOs seem to be attracted to trains or train tracks or seen in the vicinity of
trains that alone is kind of interesting and yeah each case adds to our knowledge
of what's going on here and now let's move to another Super fascinating case
which I call we did not look back this occurred on September 30 1968 in Ron
France it is a multiple witness case involving very unusual humanoids a
rather typical UFO but I like this case because it sort of demonstrates how a very close UFO
encounter can have a profound effect emotionally on a witness I mean this
encounter really frightened these young Witnesses quite badly it's a very interesting case
this next case was investigated by French researchers Luke Bon and rul Fu
and this appeared in the French language publication lumier Donan lights in the
night this is a multiple witness case of a landed UFO and humanoids though the main witness is Guy Lamar this was on
the night of September 30 1968 guy and his friend were out driving
a motorcycle in the area of ronen France this is about 10 km south of Troy but
they ran out of gas so they left their motorcycle behind and began to walk to their destination and it was around 300
a.m. when they were walking down this rural Country Road and saw this weird
large reddish star-like object moving very fast in a horizontal path across
the sky ahead of them it moved off into the distance and they lost sight of it they thought thought that was it but
moments later coming around a corner in the road they were surprised to see that this glowing red object had apparently
landed in the field ahead of them not far from the side of the road they could
see it was a pretty large object was glowing a bright red orange which was highly visible in the dark of the night
it appeared to be resting on Landing legs which were about 1 m in height they said it was rounded in shape glowing
very brightly had many bright Port holes or lights around the edge it wasn't super big
about the height of a car but maybe 50 ft wide they did notice that the top
Dome part was not illuminated it was clearly unusual and the two young men
were very shocked to see two very unusual looking figures standing next to
it and I'll just quote guy directly as he says when we saw that there were
characters who moved moved around the craft we hid in a ditch sheltered from their sight by a grass slope we were
watching them from there they could not see us they moved rather quickly with
very strong sources of light in their hands they ran but at a certain distance
from the ground 50 or 60 cm therefore without touching the ground these beings
were small hardly more than one me meter surely they ran like us normally but
without touching the ground so the Witnesses were about 150 M
away less than 500 ft and these beings were shining these very powerful
flashlights back and forth on the ground as if looking for something but most strange was the way they appeared to
float about 2T above the ground sometimes zipping about 300 ft in one
quick movement floating so fast in fact that it was hard to track their movements the beings themselves also
appeared to Glow with light now suddenly one of the beings started to approach
the two witnesses and the boys were now close enough that they could see the hands of these beings which also looked
quite unusual according to guy they looked more like two pinches rather than fingers they could not distinguish any
facial features but as this one figure continued to approach them it came as
close as 15 ft and the boys believed that their presence had been detected so
they quickly jumped up and ran away in complete Panic as guy says we ran away
very frightened terrified we did not look back so having left the scene
without looking back they do not know how the beings or the craft departed but some years later 3 years
later on December 5 1971 again around 3:00 a.m. in the morning guy had another sighting he was
with two friends driving near miter France when they all saw this weird glowing object coming in for what looked
like a landing about 200 ft from the road was covered with lights and Guy
remembering his previous encounter and how frightened it had made him he got
scared all over again and he was afraid that this object would follow them so he accelerated quickly past it but as he
did he could see that it was hovering only about 15 maybe 20 F feet above the ground was bell-shaped he said it had a
dark band around the top and that's it he couldn't take it he was too scared
and left the area as fast as he could I've said it before but it Bears
repeating UFOs are seen everywhere and this has been going on for a very very
long time there are so many cases there's little doubt certainly in my own mind that we are being visited by
extraterrestrials how else can you explain all of these cases cuz here's another one and this one also exhibits
some of the same behavior we see over and over again which is why I gave it the title rock collecting aliens this
occurred in 1976 in San Galo de Amar in Brazil
Brazil has a huge number of cases the Brazilian governments been quite a bit
more forthcoming than a lot of governments on our planet which I also find very interesting I think that is
due to the high levels of activity and this is another case where a witness Came Upon A landed UFO very strange
humanoids and they appeared to be collecting samples we see a lot of cases like this this points towards the idea
that ETS are here doing all kinds of scientific studies it's also a really
interesting case because there's some Landing trace evidence this case comes from researcher B Pratt who personally
interviewed the witness was just before dusk one evening in 1976 as 99-year-old
hercilio D Costa was walking to her home in saalo do Amarante this is in Sierra
Brazil after attending catechism class she was walking through a patch of
woods this is a rural area when she noticed a strange light ahead of her
moments later She Came Upon a craft sitting on three legs in a dry
rivered this craft was round she said silver in color it had a little door two
little round windows covered with dark glass she also noticed two red lights on
the craft and the craft itself was making a very loud noise which was somewhat like a helicopter but
definitely not a helicopter there were no propellers of any kind and standing
around this craft were seven men quite tall each about 6 ft tall
they were all wearing dark bodysuits one she said was kneeling down and appeared to be putting small Pebbles into a
transparent bag and I'll just let her cilio describe
what happened next as she says the men looked like Americans they had normal mouths hands
no hair I didn't see the hair as it was covered by their clothes I didn't see their eyes they were wearing black boots
that came to midcap the man who spoke to me opened his mouth when he spoke they didn't try to catch
me I was so afraid that I felt chest pains I ran back to the village and told
some men who went back there so yeah one of these figures did
speak audibly to her in some sort of strange language which she was not able to understand or identify and even
though nothing happened to her she was very badly frightened she fled the scene told told the adults what she saw and
they returned to the site no more than 10 minutes after it happened but the craft was gone so were the humanoids but
they did find Footprints and they also found three squarish holes in the ground
apparently where the landing legs of this craft had depressed into the soil
yes that is a single witness case and yes the witness was a child but with the landing traces it's clear something very
unusual happened there and again it fits the pattern we see in so many cases
where these craft land ETS come out they bring out their little shovels or start
picking plant samples or taking soil samples or what have you so it certainly
fits the pattern we see in so many cases as does this next case which I call the
floating humanoid a lot of cases of these ETS kind of just levitating and
floating around and that's why I want to include this case cuz it's a typical example of this I also found it
interesting the way the ET was dressed in an very skin tight suit so tight that
the witness initially thought that this humanoid was not wearing any clothes at all but decided that he was in fact
wearing clothes this one occurred on December 30 1979 near Sicily Italy and it's a
somewhat brief case that this gentleman saw this ET very close up and it's just
an unusual case overall that I think you'll find quite interesting this next case is quite brief but certainly very
interesting it was 1:30 a.m. again on December 30 1979 when electrician Sebastiano pener
woke up because the lights in the house were flashing on and off and the dog in the Attic was growling strangely in the
room with him were his wife and infant daughter both who remained asleep but looking outside his window
Sebastiano saw a brilliant globe of light and what appeared to be a
silhouette of a being suspended inside it it looked to him like this entity was trying to spine on them through the
bedroom window so he did not have perfect vision he quickly grabbed his eyeglasses and
now he could see clearly that there was in fact a being of some kind in this globe of light and he approached the
window to get a closer look at this being and could in fact see that it was a humanoid of some kind very short about
3 fet tall was dressed in a skintight white suit that was so tight for a
second he thought that this figure was naked but he could now see that this
being was wearing a jumpsuit of some kind so tight he could see the being's
musculature he said it also wore a tight white hood on its head and the being was
in side profile but quickly turned facing its back to the witness so
Sebastiano never got a good look at its face but looking at the back of this figure he saw that there was a thin
black stripe which led from its left shoulder to its right waist he also
noticed something else strange on the back of this suit there were several prominent black dots on it now we could
not see the being's forearms but he could see the being's elbows at its side
he noticed that the being's torso looked s slightly swollen as if the suit was
partially filled with air on the sides though otherwise it was very close fitting and another weird thing was the
way this figure moved it started to move away from the window in small jerks just
a few inches at a time it covered about 10 to 15 ft in the space of about 5
minutes which is a pretty long time and it wasn't walking but was rather
floating at a slight angle finally with a sudden burst of very quick movement it
glided away and disappeared behind a wall and it was gone to me that's the kind of case that raises all kinds of
questions what the heck is this humanoid doing outside of this guy's house
because it did not come inside he didn't see any craft you know what's it doing
is it contacting somebody else is it taking samples is it just there to visit is this sort of a display to let this
witness know that ETS are real why did it not look at him it seemed to just
completely ignore him all of these cases raise so many questions it's again one
of the reasons I do this research there's clearly still a lot to learn about what's going on here and now we
move to another case which is really interesting it's another multiple witness case people seeing a UFO in
humanoids pretty darn close up I call this one two aliens above 2 Street this
occurred on May 25 2012 in Clinton Missouri another show me state encounter
and yeah it's really interesting because this UFO is seen in a place that's pretty darn populated what would a UFO
be doing hovering right over a traffic intersection uh hard to say for sure but
I like this case because yeah they got a very closeup look at this craft with humanoids inside of it it wasn't as far
as I know professionally researched but the firsthand eyewitness testimony is
quite compelling indeed this very interesting multiple witness encounter is fairly recent and it was reported to
the UFO case book by one of the witnesses the Witnesses are Anonymous
and again it has not been formly investigated but it's certainly a compelling firsthand eyewitness account
and I'll just quote the witness directly and she says six of us were leaving a
restaurant and traveling in two cars we headed to drop off some of our party we
were driving West on Highway 7 and as we approached the stoplight at Second
Street all of us four of us in my car and two in another car in front of us
all saw a craft of some type in the sky just below the clouds it had four
rectangular windows in it the car in front of us saw it first and got a better view of the object the two people
in the car in front of us said that they saw thin humanoid type beings standing
in two of the windows which emitted a yellowish glow from inside the craft no
one in my car saw the beings but we did clearly see the windows and saw the
craft back up move down a bit then move up into the clouds there were no lights
on the outside of the craft and it was so dark that it was difficult to see the shape of it so all we could clearly see
were the four horizontal windows with a light inside of them our friends in the
first vehicle were so shaken by this that they refused to talk about it
anymore I'm reporting this because I think you should know about the incident surely other people saw it as well I
just can't believe it we are all very practical people and no one one has seen
a UFO before but I believe that was exactly what we saw since that night
I've been seeing some strange big white and Amber lights in the sky that look like they have webs over them and pulse
different colors I've never seen those before either I would like to know what
is going on so there you go it's another case that raises all kinds of questions
it is what we would term basically a close encounter of the first kind a simple sighting but there were
humanoids so I guess you would call that a Clos en counter of the Third Kind not so sure how effective some of these
classifications are because people can have a sighting and have telepathic communication how would you classify
that so there again is still so much to learn I I suspect that that sighting may
have involved someone else being taken on board said it before one person sighting is another person's onboard
experience but pure speculation hard to say for sure but it's one more case out
of so many that makes it very clear we are not alone on this planet that we are
being visited and to ignore all these cases and say they're not true or
they're the result of hoaxes hallucinations misperceptions and mental illness simply doesn't hold water there
are far too many so many witnesses of very high credibility
I mean that case involving Chester grusinsky and the federal or the uh
FDR aircraft carrier I mean that's undeniable you can say that some of
these Witnesses are lying but when you have that many Navy officers seeing all
this kind of stuff don't think that the hoax explanation holds any water
whatsoever but I am just putting forth the facts as we know them you can make up your own minds about it I really want
to thank you for watching I think this is a very important subject so I really
appreciate it we all deserve to know the truth it's time for this cover up to end and I hope one day it does frankly I
don't think our governments will ever willingly disclose but truth has a way of taking care of itself so we will see
so thanks once again and until next time keep searching for the truth keep asking
those hard questions and most important of all keep having fun I'll see you next Friday bye guys
