FORGETTING UFOS: THREE CASES OF AMNESIAC
Oct 17, 2020

Summary:
Oct 17, 2020
Sometimes UFO encounters are shrouded in a weird forgetfulness. Amnesia is a very real problem 
when dealing with extraterrestrials. Many encounters occur, but the witnesses forget about them. 
This video presents three incredible UFO encounters during which the witnesses experienced 
amnesia and other weird amnesia-like effects.

"The Case of the Glowing Egg." Hearing about recent sightings in their area, three teen-age 
boys go out UFO hunting and get more than they bargain for when a strange egg-shaped craft 
shows up, confronting them face-to-face.

"Beamed by a UFO." Nineteen-year-old "Jay" and his friend hear about a nearby farm that is 
being visited by UFOs. They decide to investigate, causing a series of UFO encounters that 
will change Jay's life forever.

"Five Hours Onboard a UFO." Starting at age twelve, "Jack" experiences a series of bizarre 
events, all of which remained unexplained. Then 25 years later, a weird accident occurs 
which causes Jack to remember everything.

Three cases of close encounters, each involving profound forgetfulness and missing time. How 
can an event as amazing as UFO contact be totally forgotten? As these cases show, the ETs 
seem to do it with perfect ease. This raises the question, how many people have been taken 
onboard a UFO and don't remember anything? 

For those who'd like to learn more about UFO encounters, these three cases and others are 
presented in detail in my book, "Extraterrestrial Visitations: True Accounts of Contact."

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Today's episode is called "Forgetting UFOs: 
Three Cases With Amnesia". Forgetting part or all of a UFO encounter is fairly common. 
It turns up a lot in onboard UFO encounters, but also turns up in sightings. Simple sightings. 
This is a huge problem in this field. It's very strange because generally speaking, people describe 
their ufo encounters as something they think about every day. Something they remember very vividly. 
But on the other hand, there's this weird amnesia aspect which can be pretty pervasive and take on 
all different kinds of forms. I mean, it not only happens to one person but can happen in crowds of 
people. So, that's what I want to talk about today. I've got three cases I personally 
investigated. Which I think perfectly illustrates this phenomena. And each involve what I believe 
to be an onboard experience. We all recall to some varying degrees in varying ways.

The first case I want to talk about is the case of the "Glowing Egg". This case took place in 
Ann Arbor, Michigan. Outside of Ann Arbor, actually, in 1962.  The main witness is Rob Baldwin. 
He's a really nice man. I met him when I went to speak down in San Diego. He was running this small 
UFO group and told me about this incredible sighting he had had in 1962 which he spontaneously recalled. 
So, this case is fascinating. Rob, age 16, had heard about these sightings going on outside his 
hometown and became very interested in it. He decided that he and his three friends were 
gonna go UFO hunting and see if they could see these UFOs. The whole town was a buzz about UFOs.

So they go out one evening and just drive around. They don't see anything. They finally end up in 
on this little road in a farming community. It's called Denton Road. It's in Canton, Michigan. Right 
outside of Ann Arbor. And they found this little dip in the road. A 50 foot long dip where it came 
down in elevation about 10 feet. So, they were hidden from eight cars coming on in either direction. 
But still, had a really good view of the sky. And they had parked there for just a short time when 
something very strange happened. This UFO came zooming up and appeared right at the edge of this 
culvert. This little dip in the road where they were hiding. And I'll just let Rob describe in his 
own words, 

<blockquote>
What happened well this is an incident that happened to me when i was about 16 years old.
Here we go. So, we're out in the country now. We heard about the swamp gas in this one area 
and we're about, probably 10 miles outside of Ann Arbor, Michigan. And we had just gotten settled in. 
We picked this old dirt road and uh it was literally in the middle of nowhere. In farmer country and 
and there was this just one small little dirt road going straight out with in here. You can hold 
this just with the...I have to use my hands on us with trees going over the top which sort of 
embrace the road. Cradle the road and frame the road. Actually, and on either side you have dirt. 
Dirt areas where the farmer raised their crops, primarily corn and soybeans and whatnot. So, anyway 
we're there. It's about midnight hot hot summer night, about 1961. 

And we just got there. And so we 
just settled in. Probably there 10 minutes and we're in this little bit of a dip. Now, Michigan is 
very flat and uh we're in this little dip in the road. In fact, if you look down the road you probably 
wouldn't have seen our car. Not very smart to be hiding in a dip in the middle of the road but you 
know again we were 16 years old. It was michigan, midnight on a Saturday night. Probably, and believe 
me nobody was traveling down that road so we're pretty safe. 

So, we're sitting in the car. Just 
talking. Been there 10 minutes as I said. And this structured craft came floating down the center 
of the road. And it was about three feet off the road. Just right in the middle  of the road. And it 
looked like a giant egg. Now, this craft, I call it a craft because I know it wasn't an egg and it 
was probably about nine or ten feet from top to bottom. Big. The big part on the bottom just as you 
would see a gigantic egg. About five feet from side to side. 

Now, this thing had the most incredible 
colors. I mean, they were the most beautiful reds and yellows and golds and  
oranges and pinks. The basic color spectrum. Only the perfect representation of each basic color in the 
spectrum. Now, there it was. These colors were floating around, kind of in blobs and all over the surface 
of this thing. They're all touching one another but they're they never intermingled. So that one color 
would run into another. The greens and perhaps blues would be together and they would just be kind of 
mushing together. To all maintain uh their integrity they're floating around on the surface of this craft, 
basically defining what the shape of this craft was. It was self-eluminated but it wasn't like a big 
bright light. It was simply a light on the craft. No light really hit the ground. 

So, it was a self-eluminated, very restricted light source. I opted to start the car up and move towards this 
object. Now, this object was probably only about probably 30 feet from the car. Was like literally 
right in front of us. All of us saw it and we're in on the angle of looking up through my windshield. 
Was probably on an angle about like that. Perfectly in view full view of everybody in the car. Start the 
car up. As I started the car moving towards this thing, this thing just backed away from this little dip. 
I was telling. But don't forget that this ravine. We're kind of going away from me for me. 
I accelerated the car. So, I floor the car and this thing just went. It took off like a shot, 
an orange blur. Like a gigantic cannonball shooting down the road. But it was down the road and 
hit a hole and remember this canopy I was talking about he had a hole in the canopy and it was gone 
out of sight. Maybe five seconds. 
</blockqquote>

This is where it gets very strange. Rob does not remember what happened next. He doesn't believe 
they talked about it and in fact he remembers nothing more from that evening at all. They never 
discussed this event one bit. As Rob says "I don't remember talking about it after that. I don't 
remember talking about it at all. I don't remember anything about that night. At all, after that 
experience. Basically, the event was just warehoused for 25 years. Pretty strange. I don't remember 
anything, nothing at all". 

So, not only did they not talk about it  they didn't even think about it in fact   the entire event was completely shrouded  in amnesia for apparently all four of them  
uh they were friends for a long time and  rob finally moved away uh he moved to  
california and it was some 25 years later  when he spontaneously recalled this event  
and was just blown away and wondered you know  started to wonder what his friends remembered  
and was delighted when the 30-year high  school reunion came up he's like i'm going  
to my 30-year high school reunion and hopefully  these guys will be there and i can ask them  
so he goes to his high school  reunion and sure enough they're there   his three friends are there and so he approaches  them one by one and asks them what they remembered  
about this giant glowing egg they had seen  and again this is where it just gets bizarre  
he approached one friend and his friends denied  the event ever happened had no memory of it uh  
at all so he approached a second friend the  second friend's like oh yeah i remember that  
someone was playing a trick on us someone jumped  out from the road and had flashlights or something  
and that blew rob away even more one friend  doesn't remember it at all and one thinks  
it's people with flashlights or something uh rob  pretty much dismissed both those stories because  
he had a very clever uh vivid memory of what  happened and it didn't match that at all  
so finally funds the fourth friend  and the fourth friend his story was   just completely blue rob's mind again the fourth  friend remembered exactly what rob remembered  
initially this object just suddenly appears next  to them on the road and is hovering and watching  
them and this is where his memory diverges from  rob according to rob's friend they actually all  
four got out of the vehicle and were standing in  the road looking at this thing and they walked  
over into the field into the farmer's field right  next to the road and this object followed them and  
hovered directly over them in this farmer's field  and that's all he remembers he does not remember  
rob chasing this object or this object shooting  up through the hole in the canopy of the trees  
so here we have a case with four boys all  who remember completely different versions  
of the same event so this is a perfect case of how  amnesia is such a huge problem in this field and  
can involve certainly more than one person and  to this day rob has no memory of what happened  
on that evening neither did the other guys in  terms of you know was there missing time i think  
there probably was because these sort of varying  uh events these variations are sort of a red  
flag that investigators look for indicating  that perhaps there's a more extensive encounter
second encounter i'd like to talk about by pure  coincidence took place about 30 miles away from  
this other encounter this is in the small town of  pinckney michigan and i call this case beamed by  
a ufo the main witness wants to remain anonymous  i call him jay and the incident took place when  
he was 18 years old and this was in 1978 again  out of the small town of pinckney michigan and  
it started out very similar uh jay had heard about  sightings at a local farm not far from his house  
apparently this guy said ufos were hovering over  his farm on a regular basis and the sightings  
were so predictable that people were going  there in large numbers to watch these ufos  
so jay and his friend decided that's what  they were going to do on this evening   and september 1978 they pile into his uh car and  his pickup and drive off to this farmer's field  
and they get there and jay cannot believe his eyes  there must be 300 people there there's barely room  
to park cars are lining up both sides of the  road uh lots of people are there it's a carnival  
atmosphere festival kind of atmosphere the news is  actually there there's a news station interviewing  
people and yeah as he said 300 people are there  and uh i'll just let him describe what happened  
as jay says in his own words about 15 minutes  after we got there coming directly south in line  
with this guy's field was what appeared to be a  grid of 40 different vehicles i guess you call  
them vehicles spinning they kind of moved as one  and i remember them being red and yellow and kind  
of marbling their color almost like a lava lamp  so everyone just stared silently up at this object  
or objects j thinks it was probably one object  because it moved in unison but if it was one  
object it had to have been huge it wasn't quite  easy to tell if it was one object or not but he  
was really struck by their strange coloration  the way it kept turning red and yellow and  
had this kind of marbling color very much actually  like uh rob described in the previous case  
so they're watching this and this is again when  things started to go from weird to much weirder  
and i'll again just let jay describe what  happened as he says nobody was freaking out  
and going ooh or ah even myself it was kind  of a hypnotic effect like oh that's nice  
then people got in their cars and left like  it was no big deal you'd think that they  
would have freaked out on this it's one of the  biggest things i've ever come in contact with  
but we got tired and left they were still there  when we left we didn't care anymore so this is  
really completely out of character we have a  group of 300 people who should be jumping up   and down because they're being visited  by what appear to be extraterrestrials  
and what does everyone do they decide they're  just going to leave and no one's talking about   it no one's jumping up and down and screaming  there's this weird calming hypnotic effect  
nobody's talking about it and this  is how this amnesia starts i think  
so jay and his friend drive off even though  the object is still there and the encounter  
is not over yet in fact it's just beginning this  is one of the most incredible nights of jay's life  
he was about to have a series of encounters  that would change his life forever   so he and his friend head off down highway 36 his  friend lives on a dirt road off the main highway  
jay drops him off and is heading back onto the  main highway it's a forested area when he sees  
a ufo again it's got a different appearance it  appears much smaller and closer it's hovering  
at treetop level and sending down beams of light  randomly this is a very remote area there should  
be no reason a helicopter would be out there and  he's not close enough to quite hear it but uh  
he's in line with it so he flicks his high beams  at it a couple of times and it seems to react  
uh and he drives up to this thing and  leans out of his car he can't hear  
any helicopter but he does hear a low buzzing now  he's a kind of a whirring whooshing buzzing noise  
and this thing sends down beams of  light around in the woods and then   moves off towards the east so jay's like  wow just seen two ufos this is amazing  
and he's heading gets back on the main  highways heading east on highway 36  
and is just passing his high school  pinkney high school where he went to school  
and looks up in the sky and hovering way  up there right above the football field  
is another object this one looks like a giant  monolith a huge black rectangle like a domino  
just hovering way high up in the sky it's pretty  high up there so i can't quite tell how big this  
thing is but it looks big and uh it's just  hovering up there moving around a little bit  
and he's amazed he's watches it as it  scoots around and finally just moves off  
so now he's really excited he's seen three  ufos all of them look different and he's gonna  
can't wait to tell his mom he's now about eight  miles from home and to get home he has to turn off  
highway 36 and he turns on to this  gravel road it's a well-maintained  
two-lane gravel road so he can go pretty  fast about 50 miles 55 miles per hour he's  
got eight miles to go and he's just heading  along through this very remote area it's  
uh state-owned land forested it's a crystal  clear night not a cloud in the sky no fog  
and suddenly he notices something very strange  the stars behind him are starting to disappear  
and he can't quite make sense of it he  notices everything's kind of getting darker  
and uh he's looking around trying to understand  what's going on he sees that stars are  
disappearing he looks in his rear view mirror  you can see what looks like this giant black  
object approaching and it flashes some sort  of lights and so he slows down his car stops  
uh he thinks he left the engine on he certainly  left the headlights on he gets out of his truck  
walks up to the front of it turns around  and sees this uh object approaching and  
it was apparently the same object he had seen  hovering over the high school it was giant black  
rectangle shaped object this really  pitch dark black a non-reflective surface  
that was just the blackest black he's  ever seen and he's jazz he's amazed this  
thing is approaching towards him and it's  pretty darn low it's like maybe 150 feet  
and i'll just let him describe what  happened as this object approached him  
as he stood in front of his car as jay says  my first reaction was this is great come here  
then it got closer and i started to realize  how darn big it was i mean this thing would  
have dwarfed our field i think they could have  put 30 40 000 human beings in this son of a gun  
it was like having some major building like  the united nations building turned sideways  
and held over your head ready to drop this  thing was bigger than a battleship this  
thing dropped down on me and then it wasn't  funny anymore i started to get a weird fear  
so now this thing is about a hundred feet overhead  and things start to get stranger it starts  
flashing all these lights beautiful colored lights  that moved randomly in this weird sort of swirling  
pattern across the surface the  bottom of this huge huge object  
uh it was beautiful to see that it was red green  orange blue uh swirling all over no particular  
source that he could see uh just kind  of appearing these weird random patterns  
at the same time he could feel this  incredible sense of electricity and static  
in the air all his hair was standing up  on edge and on his arms and on his head  
so he could physically feel this thing it  was making this low thrumming humming noise  
and he's just staring up at it in complete  awe uh and you know some trepidation he's  
freaking out certainly a little bit when  suddenly this thing sends down a beam of   light how he described it is if you were to take a  holy cross and put him on the bottom of this thing  
the beam of light came out right  from the center of the cross   and it struck him it was a thin beam of light and  it reminded him kind of like you know a flashlight  
from a police officer except it was a very strange  light it was almost solid it had sort of a chalky  
gray blue look to it and it struck him and he said  it was very powerful it almost felt like something  
was going through him like this was some sort of  x-ray and he was being beamed by it and they were  
getting all kinds of information or something  or there was some sort of communication there  
it really freaked him out took place  only for a few seconds and retracted  
much like a normal beam of light and after  it retracted this object started to lift up  
very slowly the noise increased a little bit and  it moved off so j at this point was keeping pretty  
close attention to the time this was around  11 pm he does not believe he had missing time  
uh now he was very excited and could  not wait to go home and tell his mom  
that he had seen four ufos in a row and had  just been beamed by one of these things so  
he heads home at top speed reaches his house  and tells his mom she does not believe him  
from accuses him of being on drugs hurts his  feelings really bad so he retreats to the barn  
and starts to play his guitar he goes up into  the hay loft and starts playing his guitar  
but wait there's more his encounter wasn't over  yet he's playing his guitar when suddenly he  
hears his humming noise again and again things get  really weird he starts to feel sort of hypnotized  
or entranced he meant to jump out and you know see  if you could see this object but he didn't instead  
he just kind of sat there listening to it for he  doesn't know how long he had this weird sort of  
sense of time he's not sure how long he stayed  there five ten minutes finally realizes what's  
happening and jumps up climbs down the ladder and  throws the barn doors open and gets a real shock  
the there's a wall of fog really really thick  fog encasing his entire farm area it's so thick  
he can't see more than 10 feet uh he's completely  shocked this can't can't be true he was just there  
a few minutes he thought you know 15 maybe and  uh there's this wall of fog next thing he knows  
he's back up in the hayloft playing his guitar  hearing the sound of this object this low humming  
noise moves slowly away off into the distance and  that's all he remembers as he said something's  
not right uh some i would have gotten up and  investigated that's not what he did so this  
case is just pervasive with amnesia from the  very beginning from from when he saw this  
giant ufo ufos with a crowd of 300 people  including his friend to seeing this other object  
and apparently having missing time at the end of  this night here i think this probably does involve  
an onboard encounter he has no memory of this  no dreams uh but this is this pattern we see uh  
and uh he did later have more sightings he  became an aircraft mechanic actually joined  
the military as an aircraft mechanic got stationed  in gulf breeze by coincidence or not and was later  
stationed at uh area 51 of all places nellis  air force base and continued to have sightings  
he eventually moved to california where he became  a fairly well-known actor a very interesting case  
and apparently as far as i know still has no  memories of ever being on board a ufo uh but i  
think probably it did happen and the third case  i'd like to talk about i'm definitely convinced  
this person had an onboard experience because of  these three cases this person was able to overcome  
his amnesia spontaneously in a very interesting  way this case i call five hours on board a ufo  
it's an incredible case he contacted me after  finding out i was a ufo researcher and hearing  
about my ufo research and i call him jack that's  not his real name and uh he had one of the most  
incredible ufo encounters i've ever heard  jack grew up on a small farm in nampa idaho  
his case occurred in 1972 at age 12 when he his  mom and his younger brother decided to go to  
the drive-in movie and they were going to the  late show and uh the movie was going to start  
when suddenly this wall of fog moves in very  quickly and completely obliterates the screen  
it's impossible to watch the movies so they get  a refund and start heading home their homes not  
far away just a few miles but the fog is so  thick that they have to inch along the road  
at a very slow pace and they're inching  along when suddenly his mom stops the car  
uh jack's brother is in the front seat jack is in  the back seat and jack's brother and jack's mother  
shout out look look at the skunk and jack looks  out the front window and he doesn't see anything  
this is what skunk and his mom and brother  said look it's right there in front of the car  
a three foot tall spotted skunk there's no  such thing as a three foot tall spotted skunk  
this was an abnormally large and very strange  looking skunk that both jack's mother and brother  
were staring at in disbelief the problem was  jack couldn't see this skunk at all and he puts  
his head right next to his mom right next  to his brothers and there's nothing there  
but his mom and brother and sister there's this  weird looking animal right in front of the car  
and at this point it gets weirder suddenly  this light starts approaching the car  
and jack's mother says oh look it's a crop duster  and jack's brother says yeah it's a crop duster  
and jack looks at it and it doesn't  look like a crop duster to him   it's got two sort of beam circles of light  approaching them he says that's not a crop duster  
and suddenly their car fills with light and  he starts to feel the sense of weightlessness  
and at this point he starts to feel a real fear  because he can't quite understand what's happening  
when the light suddenly blinks out and uh his  brother turns around grins stupidly and says  
see i told you that was a crop duster and they  drive off they drive home and the fog is lifting  
they reach home and it's now morning it there  it's light out jack can't believe it he's like hey  
hey guys it's light out and his mom says no it's  midnight you're looking at the clock wrong go to  
bed and jack turns his brother and says look  what time it is brother says it's time for bed  
and they all just crawl into bed and jack was  freaked out because his mom and his brother were  
like hypnotized like under mind control  and that freaked him out and he himself  
doesn't really remember anything except  just going directly to bed and waking up   the next day or wrong you know in the afternoon  this was very unusual they were a farm family they  
had to wake up early to care for the animals and  uh they all woke up around 4 00 p.m or so and no  
one talked about it no one said a darn thing about  it and uh they just completely forgot about it and  
as jack says and i'll quote him directly none  of us discussed this event after this happened  
i didn't ever talk to my mom about it my brother  never talked we just never talked about it  
uh i call this the silence after the storm  and this is very common particularly with  
on-board ufo encounters people not only  don't talk about an amazing ufo sighting  
they completely forget it it's just gone from  their minds and that's what happened to jack there  
were a lot of strange events that did follow this  event again this occurred when he was 12 years old  
but following that these weird sort of crop  circle patterns started to appear in the  
fields in their farm in nampa idaho and some of  these were quite large that you know cornfield  
the corn would all be knocked down in a circle  or circular pattern also a wheat field they  
had a three acre wheat field and one time this  crop circle appeared and it covered two acres  
jack's broth mom blamed jack for doing this and  jack denied it he said i did not do it uh he  
couldn't have done it it was two two acres wide  it had all these weird pinwheels coming off but   it wasn't just a circle and besides he had better  things to do than stomp down two acres of wheat  
his mom theorized maybe there  was magnetic vortexes or   tornadoes they never did figure out what  was doing it but it happened several times  
jack did notice one pattern which  was that the animals would never go  
near this thing uh none no animals would ever go  near these areas where there were crop circles  
so there were other strange things that happened  jack was an avid skier but whenever he would go  
skiing he'd have this weird physical effect his  feet would become numb the center of his heels  
would become so cold and would remain numb for  hours afterwards it was something he just couldn't  
figure out but it wasn't a huge problem so he just  sort of dismissed it as one of those physiological  
peculiarities that turn up and  you know he's still just a kid   and more weird things happen when he was a kid age  17 he needs to have four wisdom teeth removed the  
ortho oral surgeon pulls out the teeth and says  oh this is strange we have something else here  
jack is under the influence of  laughing gas he's still conscious   and the surgeon says we have this object under one  of your teeth i'm gonna have to pull it out it's  
about the size of a tooth might be another tooth  uh you know a hidden tooth but it wasn't a tooth  
the the surgeon said he's never seen anything  like it the nurse had never seen anything like  
it they weren't sure what it was and ended up  just discarding it presumably as some sort of
biological thing and uh weren't able to  explain it jack remembers this vividly  
but didn't know what to make of it uh that  same year another very strange thing happened  
uh jack was 17 years old jack was at high school  playing football when he broke his leg broke it  
badly in three places three clean breaks three  compound fractures had to be rushed off to the  
hospital they took x-rays and imaged his  leg and uh as they were treating him they  
they asked him if he had broken his leg before  because he had these metallic looking objects  
what appeared to be steel pins in his ankle near  his leg on his left leg and jack denied it he said  
no he's never breaking his broken his leg before  which he hadn't uh so that was another weird thing  
and so he's kind of just missing all these sort  of weird things one by one and doesn't know what   to make of them because other than that his life  is normal as far as he can tell life continues  
he grows up becomes an adult takes a job in a  factory ends up moving to everett washington  
gets married has kids it's 25 years later it's now  june of 1997. and something very strange happens  
jack is in the kitchen and bites down on his  tooth too hard in the wrong way and cracks one  
of his molars wide open it was very painful and  as this stab of pain goes through his body he's  
instantly transported back to  age 12 when he's on board a ufo  
and in a matter of minutes or seconds really he  recalls what happened to him when he was taken  
on board a ufo at age 12 and had five hours of  missing time and uh he remembered it in detail  
and other events as well uh he was real shook  up he had to sit down and uh just take it all  
in as these memories swirled through his brain he  remembered everything that happened and i'll just  
tell you what happened to jack during these five  hours because it's an amazing event and it's got  
some unique details i've never heard before jack  remembers uh driving you know leaving the drive-in  
his mom and his brothers say they see this skunk   they see this light approaching their car jack  and his mom think it's a cropped up duster  
you know the light hits him jack you know at  that point in the conscious version events  
jack's brother turns around and says  see i told you it was a crop duster   well now jack remembers what happens he remembers  the light hitting him feeling the sense of  
weightlessness and the sense of fear when suddenly  he's pulled up through the roof of the car he goes  
directly through the roof of the car um uh without  any obstruction and starts you know he's going up  
he's hanging upside down he's pretty afraid  not so much for himself but for his family  
and he feels like he's in telepathic contact  with these guys who are pulling him up  
and he says don't hurt my family don't  hurt my mother or my brother and the beings  
responded don't worry about them they'll  be fine we don't need them we need you  
they'll be fine don't worry and next thing  jack knows he finds himself inside this object  
his first impression is that this thing is  much larger than he thought it was this huge  
building sized object a pretty big room he and  he said it was fairly well lit but there was no  
lighting source no lamps no lights that he could  find just indirect lighting there were no corners  
there was a completely rounded room and it was  also very strange in its color he said it was  
kind of this dull brassy color like the color of  brass it was the best way you could describe it  
sort of metallic looking and it was  just pretty much this huge object  
he's placed on this table which is floating there  and the table melds to the surface of his body  
he kind of sinks into it and all these beings  surround him a crowd of them maybe ten and it's  
very strange he cannot remember these beings  he does not know what these beings look like   uh he does not remember uh but he has the  feeling they were short and perhaps shocking or  
in appearance for or unpleasant to look at uh but  no he can't remember but what he does remember  
is that it would they they had this very strange  way of communicating they communicated in the sort  
of hive mind and every decision they had to make  they sort of took a vote like a jury and they were  
playing a sort of good cop bad cop with him some  of them would say oh we should just put him back  
throw him out and another would say no we're not  going to do that we need to examine him and as  
they started talking this is the impression he got  that they had kind of a hive mind that they were  
very logical not emotional at all and had to  take a vote on every single decision they made  
there did appear to be a boss um head figure in  charge and another guy was much more friendly he  
played the good cop and was kind of the doctor  and was the guy who was communicating mostly  
with jack telling him you know don't worry  this point jack said what about my family  
what about my family and they again reassured  him and said don't worry about them they'll be  
fine they'll be fine where they are we don't need  them we need you you'll be back soon and so jack  
felt some reassurance he was still pretty scared  he was looking for a way out he's examining this  
craft there's this weird partition on one side  and on another side he can see what looks like uh  
well not a doorway it's not really an escalator  or maybe an elevator or a ramp going upward  
it's very unfamiliar to him and he had a  kind of a lot of difficulty describing it
but he definitely gets the impression this is  a very large space these beings are surrounding  
him looking at him like he's some kind of a  puzzle some seem disinterested and just want to  
move on and others are like no no we need to  examine him and that's what they do they he  
sees some of them move towards his feet and they  start pressing these instruments into his heels  
and he can physically feel it and it's a very  cool instrument his feet feel very very cold  
and they're pressing him into his heels it's  not painful but he definitely can feel it  
and then one of them moves to his mouth he has  they instruct him to open his mouth and they're  
putting some kind of instrument in his mouth and  the examination continues on for a short while  
and he's not sure what happens next but after  some point they finish and they lift him up  
and start floating him around the craft  he's not walking there he's just floating  
and they float him from room to room he doesn't  really remember much except suddenly they pull him  
into the center of the craft and drop him down  they put this sort of bungee cord like device  
around him and drop him down out of the craft  and dangle him out of the bottom of the craft  
he's in this clear diamond shaped container it  looks like plastic or glass it's diamond shaped  
he's dangling out of the bottom of the craft and  he gets a clear 360 degree view you can see the  
bottom of the ufo and you can see his farm and  all the terrain around this area for miles around  
uh you can see the road leading up to his farm  the telephone poles see the fog it's a foggy night  
uh you can see everything and wherever he looks  this thing swivels around and turns so he gets  
a perfect 360 degree view it's disorienting at  first but he sees it's actually really cool and  
he starts playing with it and just whirling around  and looking around enjoying the view and does this  
for several minutes until some point they pull him  up and they dart down over his farm and right over  
the telephone wires and he can see this through  a portion of the craft that becomes transparent  
this is something i see all the time people  don't describe windows and said they describe   looking out through the craft and a portion  of the wall becomes transparent or the floor  
and that's what happened here jack's looking  down through part of the floor on the side   of this craft and one of the beings is explaining  what's happening that they're pulling electricity  
out of the telephone wires this beam of light  comes from the ufo hits the telephone wires  
and starts pulling electricity out and it was a  huge amount of energy it just powered up this ufo  
this is something we see a lot with  sightings um you know i don't know of   any cases where someone's been inside a ufo  and watched this happen except for this one  
so this case might be unique in that regard uh  but i'm sure there are other cases out there  
but that's apparently what jack was witnessing  here then stealing power from our electric lines  
he could physically feel it the whole  craft itself buzzed with electricity  
uh it was very uncomfortable for him it was a very  cold feeling he says it was physic physically cold  
and it actually made his teeth hurt like biting  on tin foil or something so he could physically  
feel this and the being was explaining  all kinds of things to him at this point  
most have went over his head i  mean he just didn't understand it   it was a lot of geometry he said being thrown  at him he saw shapes squares circles triangles  
all kinds of math formulas but most of it  just went completely over his head and so  
he's not sure how long that went on either so  all these different events were happening to him  
and next uh this craft started darting around  and they took him to a couple of places he says  
he doesn't remember them he does not remember  what happened he does remember at some point   seeing very unfamiliar terrain uh  earth-like as far as he could tell  
but definitely not a place he recognized  and after that they craft darted again it  
would dart around like a bullet and suddenly  they're over his car and he's being pulled  
out of the craft and he's in this beam of light  heading head first down in this beam of light  
and he says it's kind of fun and he's enjoying  it and starts doing flip-flops and just having  
fun and he again asks about his family and  they said don't worry they're fine don't worry  
and he's placed back into the car and placed  on the seat and the beam of light retracts and  
his brother turns around grinning and says see i  told you it was a crop duster and they drive home  
and that's what he recalled maybe not the full  five hours but certainly a good portion of it  
so now it's 25 years later jack's in his  kitchen trembling and shaking is after who  
remembers all this after he gathers his wits  he calls up his brother and asks him about  
this incident his brother remembers nothing  does not remember this incident at all and
he decides he's going to call his mom and asks if  she remembers he calls his mom and his mom's like  
yeah i do remember seeing that skunk a three  foot tall spotted skunk that was really weird  
and jack's like mom you know there was no skunk  i was right next to you i didn't see any skunk  
and do you remember the light she's like oh yeah  the crop duster i remember that and he's like what  
else do you remember you know do you remember when  we got home and she's like yeah i do remember that   it was morning and i for all these years i've been  wondering why the heck i kept you boys out all  
night well jack nearly fell off his chair when he  heard that that was all the confirmation he needed  
his mom remembered what happened she remembered  the light she remembered the missing time and  
this gave confirmation enough for jack to think  that you know his memories of what he recalled   were real now suddenly all the weird events  made sense the crop circles the cold spots  
in his ankles the weird object in his tooth the  object in his foot so all these things finally  
made sense and uh really shook him up he also  remembered about two weeks after this incident  
his bedroom filled up with light this beam of  light came in and he was sucked out of his bedroom  
right through the closed window and into a craft  and he doesn't remember what happened after that  
so uh here's a case where he had amnesia for 25  years did not even know about the event and then  
spontaneously remembered only because he cracked  his tooth i'm not sure he would have remembered   had he not cracked his tooth and this makes me  think there are a lot of people who may have been  
abducted taken on board a ufo and have no memory  of it at all or people who may have seen a ufo  
and have no memory of it whatsoever it's very  strange why would a ufo show itself off to someone  
obviously wanting to be seen and  then completely erase the memory  
so yeah this is something we run into all the  time these three cases i took from my book  
extraterrestrial visitations  true accounts of contact and  
a lot of these cases in that book had this  problem some people of course are able to  
remember their memories through the use  of regressive hypnosis which i support  
i think it's a fantastic and very effective  method to recover memories uh but my point is that  
this the fact that there is such a strong amnesia  aspect these encounters really skews our numbers  
of in terms of any estimates of how common  this type of experience is if people don't  
actually remember it i'm thinking the number of  sightings number of on-board encounters is far   far more common than people think and uh we run  into this all the time i mean there was one lady  
i was inter i interviewed her about her  encounters i'd done several interviews   she had seen this weird light over  her house she was across the street  
i was interviewed her about that called her  back a week later to do a follow-up interview  
and she had no memory of the event and not only  that she didn't remember me interviewing her  
had no memory of me actually calling her up  and interviewing her about what she had seen   so both of these events were strated in  amnesia like listen i've got you on tape  
about what you saw so that  freaked her out freaked me out   it shows that this can be you know retroactive  that amnesia can come sometime after the event  
so that's why i think this is important  that uh there are a lot of cases out there  
this is a very pervasive problem and it's one that  i think needs to be addressed more aggressively  
and uh that's kind of the  reason why i did this video   and it would be my recommendation to people  even if you see a ufo write it down immediately  
even as it's happening because i do know  of cases of people who found their notes  
and uh saw that they had recorded a ufo  sighting which they had no memory of   whatsoever so that is fascinating to me uh this  whole amnesia aspect so let's watch out for that  
and that's why i did this video to guard against  ufo forgetfulness and for getting ufos so that's  
my presentation for today once again thanks  very much for listening and keep having fun
