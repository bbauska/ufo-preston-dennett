UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE THIRTEEN
Aug 1, 2025

Summary:
Aug 1, 2025
Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown Episode Thirteen,” the continuing investigative series which proves that UFOs are being seen everywhere on this planet. This series was born from a challenge: name any town, city or location on Earth, and I will find a UFO encounter there. And so far, 100% of the locations provided have a history of UFO encounters. Today we explore five new locations, each provided by you, the viewers. These locations include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Pittsburg, California; Attleboro, Massachusetts; Oahu, Hawaii and Morganton, NC. These locations not only have been visited by UFOs, they have produced the entire range of UFO encounters. Sightings, USOs, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters and even a crash/retrieval case. Many are supported by compelling evidence: landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, EM disturbances, radar returns and startling photographs. This series proves beyond a reasonable doubt that we are not alone in this universe.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA. In 1948, military pilots saw strange objects in the skies. More sightings occurred in the 1950s, which also produced startling cases of direct contact. In 1950, a woman reports that small humanoids entered her home and communicated with her telepathically. In 1954, a girl came upon a landed craft and a humanoid. In 1964, a man was taken onboard a craft and examined. In 1967, a grade-school student had a strange encounter with a gray alien who had a profound message for her. Another young girl reports she was taken onboard a craft and given a medical exam by grays. In 1978, more than 200 people observed a large craft moving over the city. On May 5, 1982, calls flooded the local police stations from people reporting UFOs. The 1980s brought more startling encounters, including a couple who saw a disc over the Birmingham Bridge, and man who collided into a UFO while driving. In the years that followed, Pittsburgh produced more encounters, making it clear that the city is of great interest to the ETs.

PITTSBURG, CALIFORNIA. This area has produced some very close encounters. In 1977, three boys were out hiking when a UFO landed nearby, and three strange humanoids chased them for several blocks. In 2009, a man observed a UFO so close to his home, his windows vibrated from the humming sound it produced. In 2014, a group of witnesses gathered in a McDonald’s Restaurant Parking lot and observed strange craft at very elevation.

ATTLEBORO, MASSACHUSETTS. In addition to many cases of anomalous lights, this city has some truly amazing cases. In December 1975, an entire family observed a spherical craft hover overhead. Some of them chased after it in their car, and they ended up having missing time. In 1981, three sisters called the police after a craft swooped down from the sky and buzzed their vehicle. In 1986, a family of four had a frightening encounter with a metallic disc which hovered right in front of their car. Unknown to them, numerous other people also saw the craft. In 2010, a family saw strange dome-shaped craft while driving near the home.

OAHU, HAWAII. This island has a very rich history of encounter. 1924, a young boy had a weird encounter with a humanoid on the beach. When a navy officer came upon a landed UFO and humanoids in 1944, the case resulted in an apparent retrieval of the craft by the military. The 1950s brought a flood of sightings, including a massive wave directly over Barber’s Point Naval Air Station. The 1960s and 1970s brought more sightings, several more humanoid cases, including onboard UFO encounters complete with profound alien messages. There were also some amazing photographic cases. Activity continued with dozens of encounters, even as recent as 2023.

MORGANTON, NORTH CAROLINA. This small town has produced several amazing encounters. A sighting over the North Carolina School for the Deaf involved more than a dozen witnesses. In 1980, a wave of sightings generated numerous calls to the police from concerned residents describing metallic craft hovering near their homes. In 1981, two young boys had a close-up encounter with a craft that would affect them for the rest of their lives. The 1990s brought more startling sightings of solid craft. A truly odd case occurred in 2006 when an inmate at the Foothills Correctional Facility reported seeing a UFO with humanoids right outside his cell.

This is just a summary of the many significant UFO events that have occurred in these locations. Once again, the evidence is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere on our planet. The obvious takeaway is UFO encounters are far more common than previously believed. And when one considers that the vast majority of people do not report their encounters, the actual number of cases must be mindbogglingly huge. It appears that the extraterrestrials are conducting a vigorous and well-orchestrated publicity campaign to announce their presence.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. Thanks so much for joining me. I've got a very exciting episode for you today. Guess what? It's time to do another hometown UFO episode. This one is called UFOs in Your Hometown episode 13. As you may know, this started as a challenge. Name any
location on this planet, any city, any town, and I bet you I can find a UFO
case there. I'm still batting 100%. I've got a list of almost 1,000 locations
from you guys, the viewers, and I'm going through the list as fast as I can and still finding cases in every single
one of these locations. It's truly amazing. I've chosen five locations
today from you guys. These come from across the United States in this
episode, including Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, California,
Adelboroough, Massachusetts, Aahu, Hawaii, and finally Morganton, North
Carolina. Now, these cases include the entire
range of the UFO phenomenon. These are not just sightings, but certainly some
sightings, some really amazing sightings, in fact, and not just anomalous lights, but solid craft.
There's also landings. There are many, many humanoid cases in this particular episode. on board cases, really
interesting UFO crash retrieval, USOS, I mean you name it. These this episode has
everything that is occurring in the UFO field and of course all kinds of
evidence. We see landing traces, we see electromagnetic effects, physiological
effects, animal reactions, radar, some incredible photographs as well. So, I'm
pretty excited about this episode. This one, I think, is a little more interesting than usual. These episodes
do require an enormous amount of research, but as I said, I love doing
them, and it's just so interesting to me that UFOs are being seen everywhere on
this planet. The implications of this are really profound. But, let's just get
started because there's so much information to share. It's truly amazing. I'm going to do this
chronologically for each location. And the first location I'd like to explore today is Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I had
quite a few of you request this location. This was really hard to research. I had to go through an
enormous amount of files and magazines and newspaper articles and books and so
forth. And I found over 20 amazing cases. This is by special request of
Chumlar, Mr. PD Taylor, Deli Blows, and
MC3. So, thank you to all four of you. Truly incredible what I found in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. As you may know, Pittsburgh is probably most famous for its steel production and is in fact
called the steel city. Also called the city of bridges. Lot of bridges in this
location incl. And interestingly enough, there's a UFO incident that
occurs right over one of the most famous bridges in Pittsburgh.
It's a huge city, 300,000 people in the city itself, but really closer to 2
million people in the surrounding areas. So, I think you'll find this quite interesting because I have cases
reaching all the way back to 1948. The first case I could find in
Pittsburgh occurred on September 12, 1948. It involves two pilots who were flying
just southeast of Pittsburgh in their C45 transport plane. And this is when
they saw a round white object moving at very high speed across the sky. A pretty
simple case, but it was followed up 3 months later on December 9, 1948 by
another very much identical sighting. This involved two Air Force pilots, a
Colonel Brown and a Mr. Mulling, who were also in a C45 transport plane
flying at about 12,000 ft when they described seeing a round object which
came about 2 miles away from their plane. Now, in aviation terms, that's pretty darn close.
Next case actually involves a humanoid. This one comes from researcher Hans
Holder who says that in 1950, a lady by the name of Kathleen Compardo was
awakened in her Pittsburgh home when she saw two transparent figures just under
three feet tall appear in her bedroom. They began to speak to her telepathically in these weird childlike
voices. They had some interesting information to share. They told her that they were very technologically advanced,
that they had laser beams which were capable of mass destruction, and they also told her that they had a device
which could easily cure cancer. They said they wanted to help humanity, but
humanity had a problem with being far too aggressive. They told her that they
had to leave at this point as they could only breathe our atmosphere for a short period of time. Quite interesting.
Here's another case two years later, February 11, 1952.
It was 3 a.m. as Captain GP Arms and Major RJ Gedson were flying a Beach AT11
trainer aircraft and they described seeing a yellow orange object which they
said had a pulsing flame behind it and it streaked across the sky in a level flight. It was only in view for a period
of 1 to two seconds, but it was certainly strange enough that they decided it was important to report it.
They do not think that this was a meteor or anything like that. Here's another very interesting case. This comes from
an article in the February 1959 issue of Fate Magazine. The witness is Bernard K.
Schaffer. He's a Greyhound bus driver and he wrote in a letter to Fate
magazine that on June 25, 1952, he was driving through the Mount
Washington suburb area of Pittsburgh. And this is when he saw a flying saucer.
And I'll just quote Bernard directly as he says, "I glanced to my right and saw
it. I stopped the car and got out. It was a cigar shape and had a reddish
orange glow around the edges. It was very big and about the size of an airliner at a height of about 2,000 ft.
It seemed to be stopped or going slow. Suddenly, it began moving at an unbelievable rate of speed and it began
to climb. I watched it for 30 seconds or so and it went out of sight. Here is a
case which occurred 2 years later and this one involves a landed UFO and a
humanoid. It was one spring afternoon in 1954
that Helen, age 10, was walking home from school and was taking a shortcut
through a grove of trees. This was actually her regular route to her home.
But this time she came around a corner in the path and saw something quite
shocking. She said she saw a small saucer-shaped craft just sitting on the
ground. Was very small. Small enough, she said, to hold no more than one or
two beings. The craft itself was perfectly smooth. No port holes, no
markings of any kind. And looking next to this craft, she saw a strange
humanoid. It was very thin, she said, and it had a weird posture and did not
look human to her. was standing perfectly still as if it was afraid of being seen. Helen herself was afraid of
being seen by it. So, she stood perfectly still. And after about 15
seconds, this being just seemed to fade away. Helen looked over at where the craft had sat and it was gone, too.
Quite an astonishing encounter. Here's another one. Three years later, 700 p.m.
October 22nd, 1957, a father and son were walking home from
the store. And this is when the son noticed three odd lights moving overhead
at only about 600 ft away. So, pretty close. And they were low enough that
both he and his father could see them actually moving between the nearby houses.
They moved off and moments later a second group of lights was seen about 150 ft away, much closer. Two of these
three lights were hovering in place and a third was moving towards them at a very slow speed. Now, at this point, the
witnesses were close enough to their home to retrieve a pair of binoculars, which they did, and they watched these
objects through binoculars as they moved off and out of sight. Now, here's another case. So astonishing this one
involves not only humanoids but an apparent onboard encounter. This case
comes from Bud Hopkins and was published in his book Missing Time. It involves a
man from Pittsburgh who wants to remain anonymous. Was one evening in 1964
that he was awakened in the middle of the night by a light shining into his third floor window. Now this is an
apartment on Fifth Avenue, a pretty populated area. The witness said he was unable to move,
but could see this humanoid figure looking into his window. This is from the third floor. Very strange. This
figure promptly disappeared and the paralysis lifted and the witness said he had a powerful impulse to go outside and
he was actually guided by this impulse to a nearby deserted mansion. And this
is where he met a group of humanoid beings, probably grays. He said that
they had very large heads, almost metallic looking eyes, but nearby was a
flying saucer, a classic disc just sitting on the ground. And the next thing the witness knows, he's inside of
it. He described a dome-shaped room illuminated by a hazy light. He felt
very calm as he was placed on a table and these two kind of glowing spheres
moved by his head. He had the impression that they were examining him. This is
one of many other encounters he had. And here's another encounter involving a
landed UFO and humanoids. And I have to tell you, this is so unusual. I did
cover this in my episode on schoolyard encounters, but it definitely is worth
repeating because this is how unusual this case is. This occurred in May of
1967. I call the witness Emily. She was in the second grade at Peebles
Elementary School in Pittsburgh. You can see it here. And this is when she had this extraordinary experience. I'll just
quote her directly. As she says, "My classmate and I walked to the side of
the school during recess. All of the other children were in the main play area at the back of the school. Our
school janitor, Mr. Swan appeared and waved us over toward the basement area
of the school to come over and see what was in the furnace room. Inside there
was a small quote Jetsonlike disc about the size of a Volkswagen
Beetle. You can see her drawings here. According to Emily, and again I'm quoting, it had seating for two. It was
a silver gray metallic color, very smooth. I vaguely remember a panel of
controls and something like blue vinyl seat. My friend said, "Mr. Swan caught
the flying saucer in the baseball field of the school." I remember her sliding
down against the wall and falling asleep. Then a small gray man appeared
from behind the furnace. I remember laughing because my girlfriend fell asleep and then being amazed at the
little man. He was about the same size as me. I was not afraid of him at all.
He talked to me in my head. He had large black eyes, but they were kind and
sincere. He had nose, maybe just a couple of small holes, and his mouth was
just sort of a line. It did not open. I don't remember any ears, but he had long
arms for the size of his body, and I think only four fingers on each hand.
His body was childlike, not muscular at all. Now, at this point, the ET told her
telepathically a very strange message. It said, "We are here to remind you who
you are." Emily didn't really understand this message. And as she says, "To this
day, about 40 years after the incident, I have no idea what he meant. I am now
49. Somehow, I was able to know how the flying saucer worked."
What an unusual case. And there's always more. It was one year later, 9:30 p.m.
on March 3rd, 1968, that multiple witnesses described seeing
three objects moving very quickly across the sky. So fast, in fact, that they
were described as bright, quote, streaks of light. Now, one group of witnesses
was a married couple, a professional engineer, and his wife. So that they viewed these objects for about 15
seconds. But there was another witness by the name of Michael Bab and he said
the objects looked to him like red discshaped craft that moved across the
sky so fast they had yellow tails sort of streaking behind them. And he watched them coorting around for a full 5
minutes. That's a pretty long time when you're looking at something like this. This next case super interesting. I
don't have the exact date for it, probably 1960s, but it does involve an onboard
encounter. The witness, Deborah Johnson, reports numerous encounters throughout
her life, but her earliest occurred when she was 6 years old living in Pittsburgh. It began one day when she
and her friend were walking outside looking for butterflies. They were on this little hill when suddenly a warm
light shone down on her and she started to feel strangely faint and dizzy. The
next thing she recalls, this was under hypnosis, she was being carried through a doorway into a white room, which she
said was very much like an operating room. And as Deborah says, there were two humanoids there calming me down.
They did a full examination. They started at my feet. They touched with the pads of their fingers everywhere, my
feet, my whole body. Then they did a gynecological exam. It was very upsetting. Now, she describes these
beings as having tiny bodies, large heads, huge piercing black eyes.
Definitely sounds like the typical grays. A very interesting case, which
I'm sure there's a lot more information to it. Here's another interesting case.
This one occurred on March 1st, 1978. And get this, it involves more than 200
witnesses. Many of them were calling the police and the local newspapers.
This was an enormous UFO which was seen flying over Pittsburgh. Two of the
witnesses were Glenn A. Richie and his girlfriend Claire Gallery. And they said
it was quote bigger than a football field. They described it as kind of a dull gray cylinder shape. They couldn't
really get the exact shape. It had four blinking lights on it, which they said were bright enough to quote, "Light
light up the whole area." You can see the drawing here. They said this object made a loud humming noise as it moved
across the sky. But a lot of witnesses. Another witness was taxi driver
Elizabeth Grossman who said, quote, "It was bigger than a plane, but it didn't seem to have any wings, and it had many
more lights than you'd normally see on a plane." Another witness was Dr. Edward
Pacina, and he said, quote, "What really got my attention was the light beam, a
ray that came from the under surface of the craft and scanned in random
patterns." So many more witnesses. Three women at a golf course said that they observed this
object very close to the ground and they absolutely insist it could not have been
a plane. I could quote many other witnesses. Now the Air Force and the Air
National Guard were contacted and they said that they knew of no aircraft in the area at the time of this sighting.
But yeah, some 200 people saw this. That sounds like a typical UFO display.
like they're showing themselves intentionally. Here's another amazing case. May 5, 1982, police stations
across Pittsburgh received a flurry of calls, mostly from the residents of the
Pleasant Hills area of Pittsburgh. One witness was actually a pilot and he was
using his police scanner and heard all these reports coming in. So, he decided
to run outside, and he's glad he did because he saw a large, somewhat
triangular-shaped object, which he says was easily the size of a jet and couldn't have been more than 1,000 ft
overhead. But it was weird because while the front section looked solid, the rest
of the object towards the rear appeared to be almost transparent. He watched it for 15 to 25 seconds, he
said, as it moved in absolute silence across the sky. So many cases. Here's
another one. Four years later, as investigated by Stan Gordon, was 11:20
p.m. on January 7, 1986, as witnesses observed a discshaped
object hovering directly over the very famous Birmingham Bridge. You can see it
here. So, that's kind of interesting. A few months later on August 12, 1986,
there were two sightings of a what was described as a long silver object. And
two weeks after that, August 31st, numerous travelers along Route 119
described seeing a craft with multiple kind of yellow green lights. They said
it was so low they were convinced that it was about to crash. That same year,
9:49 p.m. June 26, a couple saw two glowing lights moving on a parallel path
below the clouds. Pretty unusual. But then things got even stranger when these two lights began to
rotate around each other for just a few moments. Then one moved ahead of the
other. One became much brighter than the other, and both of these objects moved
off into the distance. Three years later, another amazing case. This was
reported to move on field investigator Evelyn Shum. Was 2:57 a.m. on May 17,
1989. Few women were driving through Pittsburgh when they saw a white oval
object with red flashing lights along one side and a very bright white light
underneath. They were so impressed they stopped their car and exited to get a better look. The object vanished shortly
later. But they called the police and filed a report and this is what of course led to
the case being investigated by Muon. Muon investigator Evelyn Shum was not
able to account for this sighting and it was declared quote unknown. Here's
another very unusual case which took place on July 6th, 1998.
This is so unusual. A couple was admiring the sunset when they noticed a
motionless black cigar-shaped object, which they said was shaped somewhat like
the fuselage of an aircraft, but of course had no wings, no tail structure,
nothing like that. They were very impressed by it. So they got a pair of binoculars and up close they could see
what they described as quote giant lollipops black in color sticking out
the top, the sides and underneath the object. This object they said moved side
to side. Then it appeared to almost transmogriphy into a triangular shape.
It immediately picked up speed very quickly and moved off to the north. Now, here is a case that should be much
better known. This is really amazing. I did a whole episode of people who've had
a collision with a UFO, and that appears to be what's happening in this case. This case comes from a caller who called
in to the Coast to Coast radio show. Per this witness, it was the summer of 1999
at 3:00 a.m. His name is Jay. He was driving westbound on Interstate 76. And
this is when he passed a big rig parked alongside of the road. And it was unusual because this trucker in this big
rig started honking at him. Now, the next thing Jay knows, he sees this dark,
dark object floating in the middle of the highway. And as Jay says, my
headlights hit it. And it was weird. Like the light didn't really reflect off of it. It just kind of like absorbed it
almost like it wasn't even made of metal. My car came right underneath it
and when it did, the top half of my windshield hit it. I spun out on the
road and I landed in the median and when I looked around, it was gone. The truck
was still there. All I remember was this big plunk and I ducked my head. Next
thing you know, I'm off in the ditch. Now, immediately after he struck this object, the trucker did drive off. And
examining his vehicle, Jay said that his windshield was cracked. Pretty
interesting encounter. And here's another. At 400 p.m. on November 9, 2002, three people were training for a
crossount running session when they saw an elliptical-shaped object in the sky.
Now, this wasn't way up there. They said it was only about 50 ft overhead and
they could hear it making a very soft sound at first, but then it made this kind of rumbling sound as it moved off.
3 years later, 9:30 p.m. December 11, 2005,
there was a whole group of witnesses who were standing in the backyard of their home when they observed a bright orange
object flying among the clouds. Then suddenly it stopped stationary. Then
started moving again, but this time in a circular motion. And as it started
moving in this weird pattern, it began to release a series of small fiery
spheres. And it did this three times in a row. Then the object moved off. So
clearly that's not a shooting star or any conventional aircraft.
So interesting. Now, here is a case that seems to involve a USO unidentified
submersible object, though it's not entirely clear. This was on the night of April 6, 2007 at North Park Lake. This
is located just north of Pittsburgh. Technically not Pittsburgh proper, but
so interesting, I just had to include this case. It involves a group of friends who were driving by North Park
Lake. And this is when they noticed a strange light that was shining either on the water or was just beneath the
water's surface. So, they stopped and they viewed this light from a distance of about 300 ft away. And this light,
wherever it was coming from, they couldn't really tell, was bright enough to illuminate the water 4 feet deep. In
fact, they thought they saw fish under the water. So, they weren't sure where this light was coming from, above the
water or below it. But after looking at it for a while, they did suddenly see this object several hundred feet
overhead. And as the witness says, the strange thing to me was the size of the
object. It couldn't have been large enough for even the smallest human to fit inside. The thing was literally a
floating street light with intelligence. All right, next case. 2008 11 p.m. July
18, a couple noticed a bright star-like object moving at quote a good speed was
going across the sky. Now, the husband is a military veteran, a trained observer. He has a PhD in mathematics,
so a very credible witness. And guess what? He was able to snap a photograph
of this object as it moved away. You can see the photograph here. Mufon
researchers declared this case quote unknown. One final case in Pittsburgh,
January 3rd, 2009. A witness was driving on Lincoln Way
towards Route 48. You can see it here. This is when he noticed a triangular
formation of lights above a giant Eagle store parking lot. Now, this object, he
said, was huge and very close to the ground. He saw the lights on the edge of this object light up with a brilliant
flash and it was very unusual. In fact, the very sight of it made him feel quote
nervous and he got a quote sinking feeling in my stomach. So, he called the
police who showed up on the scene. Of course, by the time they arrived, the object was gone. But the officer, to his
credit, did suggest that the witness report his sighting to a UFO group. So
incredible. Virtually the entire range of UFO encounters there. And I just want
to underline that the 20 cases I presented here probably about 1% I would
guess or less of the actual number of cases. I really kind of skipped over the
ones involving anomalous lights. Not that they're not interesting. I think
every single case has something important to contribute to our understanding of what's going on here,
but I just feel like the more extensive cases, the less ambiguous cases are more
interesting and certainly have more data and more information. But there you go,
a lot of cases in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. So, thank you again for
you guys who suggested this location. Chumlar, Mr. PD Taylor, Dolly Blows, and
MC3. I learned a lot and I just think it's so interesting. But now, let's move
to our next location, which is Pittsburgh, California. I decided to do
both Pittsburgh's because it's easier for me to do research that way. And I
didn't find nearly as many cases in Pittsburgh, California as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but I found some. This
particular location is by special request from Mark Ridge. So, thank you, Mark. Pretty interesting stuff I found,
including some real interesting humanoid cases. Well, one interesting one, I
should say. Uh, I found about four cases that I think are really worthy of mention. It's not a huge huge city. It's
certainly not small. Some 70,000 people. It's a fairly wealthy city. I also found
out something interesting. It used to be called Black Diamond basically because there was a lot of
coal mining going on in this area. Of course, changed the name to Pittsburgh
way back in the early 1900s. Definitely found some fascinating cases
here. And yeah, this one humanoid case I have covered before in a previous
episode quite some time ago, years in fact, but I thought I'd repeat it here in some brand new cases that I think
you'll find very interesting. The first really interesting case I found in Pittsburgh, California occurred on May
27, 1977. Now, I did cover this case before, but it's a humanoid case and so interesting,
so I'm going to cover it again. This case was investigated by J. Alan Heinneck of Cufos and Richard Haynes, a
psychologist and also an excellent UFO researcher. The witnesses include three
14-year-old boys, Lenny Young, Patrick Morrison, and George Ferrer. You can see
a couple of them here. It was around 11 p.m. when these three teenagers were in
a field just north of Willow Pass Road, not far from Malard Slough Road. This
was between the Santa Fe railroad tracks and the marsh at the edge of the Swissen
Bay. They wanted to go to the local teenagers hangout which was nicknamed
the pump house. This is near shore acres. So you can see this location. Now
this area does have a structure of concrete and steel. And they were hanging out there. While they were in
this field, they could see a group of unusual looking red lights, which looked to them like it was connected to one
single object, but they also saw one blue light that was quote flitting like
a firefly around the other lights. So, they said that the object with the red lights zoomed across the sky, zoomed
back, and then actually landed in the field near them. And they could now see
that it was a vehicle of some kind. It had what appeared to be square port holes. Lenny described it as quote round
but flat. Patrick said it was quote round flat with a row of square lights
like windows with one window larger than the others. Suddenly the lights started
blinking on and off reflecting from the sides of the craft. Now George said it
reminded him quote of a flying building. So all three of them were watching this
and this is when three figures emerged from this craft and began to approach
the witnesses from a distance of about 100 ft away. And these figures looked
very unusual. As Lenny says, they were like smoke. They were black, but they
had no faces. I don't know if they had arms or heads. It was like they had no clothes on. They were walking towards
us. They were about 5' 6 in to 6 feet tall. I've stayed out all night in that
field several times, and I know what people look like walking in the dark. They were not people. They were
something else. His friend Patrick agrees. As Patrick says, they were weird looking, walking slow. They looked like
they were wearing long skirts over their heads. They were black. They walked as if they were linked together, like
figures in a chain gang. George agrees that these were not normal people as he
says they were quote gray objects with a kind of human shape but no eyes. They
walked like robots. So as these figures approached, the boys became increasingly frightened and
decided to get the heck out of there and they ran. And guess what? These figures
followed them, not for a short distance, but for several blocks, close behind
them, chasing them. And when the boys were about one block from Patrick's house, the figures promptly disappeared.
The three boys made it to Patrick's house, and his mother immediately called the police. Sheriff Douglas Pendleton
took the report, and he found the boys to be entirely sincere and truthful.
They were clearly quite frightened and in fact all three boys offered to take lie detector tests. The boys were
genuinely terrified. I mean one of the boys was actually shaking in fear. Now
according to Richard Haynes and I quote, "We questioned all three boys separately. I found that the three boys
had a consistent story with a level of detail present that does not appear to
have been manufactured. If they had made up the story, they would have had to remember it very well. Their fright was
very real. Jen Heinik also interviewed him and he said it was one of three
reports of humanoids that year which he thought was credible. Amazing. And it's
not the only encounter in Pittsburgh. Here's another interesting sighting
which occurred at 9:35 p.m. on February 5, 2009.
The witness described this object that he saw in the sky as quote lemon yellow,
ovalshaped, and about the size of a football field. He said he could see a
row of circular-shaped red spots going across the center of it. And he said that as this craft moved, it left a
white trail of quote sparkling like diamonds. Now, this debris or whatever
it was, this trail fell downwards behind it. This object moved off slowly in a
straight line and then suddenly took off at quote unbelievable speed. And as the
witness says, it made my windows vibrate with the low humming sound that came from it. I've never seen anything like
it. Here's another impressive sighting which involved a group of about a dozen witnesses. This occurred on February
2nd, 2014. Two ladies were driving and pulled over at the McDonald's restaurant located at
220 Bailey Road. You can see it here. And this is when a person in the car
next to them pointed out this object in the sky. So they looked up and they saw
what appeared to be two orange orbs moving around, reappearing and disappearing, and sometimes coming
really close. And as one of the witnesses says, they were all circular
like a standard spaceship. And this one had the most beautiful lights that were
brightening and dimming, all different colors. It hovered for a while and then went very slowly westward. There were
several people in the parking lot now, and they had gotten out of their vehicles and were all staring and
pointing and asking, "What is that?" I still cannot believe that they were so
close. Even though I am a true believer, it is still shocking to see. There you
go. Those are the cases I found in Pittsburgh, California. So, thank you,
Mark. I truly appreciate you suggesting this location. It's pretty darn
interesting. All right, let's move to the next location. The next location I'd like to
explore today is Adelborough, Massachusetts. This is by special
request from Katherine Shakru. Really glad you suggested this location. I
didn't know about this town, but it's sure sounds like a very interesting place. It's sometimes known as the
jewelry city or even the jewelry capital of the world. It got famous for that. It
has a population of some 46,000 people. And I found four cases that I think
you'll find particularly compelling. This is the only location that I'm covering today that doesn't have overt
humanoid cases, but I'm telling you, I think you will find the cases that I did
find very interesting. This remarkable case appears to involve missing time.
There are multiple witnesses in this one. It took place at 7:00 p.m. on December 21st, 1975
when an entire family and some of their friends noticed a strange spherical-shaped object hovering over
their neighbors house at a pretty low elevation. As one of the witnesses says,
it made no noise and had white lights that rotated around the sphere clockwise.
Now, the son of the family and his friends decided to follow this object in their car as it moved off. So, they
followed it for some time, and they got close enough to it at one point to see that it was in fact metallic, and they
even saw what looked to them like hieroglyphic writing on its shiny metallic surface. At one point, they
took photographs, but they started to get scared and they decided to drive home. Now, it was the sister of the boy
who submitted a report. And as she says, quote, "He was actually gone for hours
longer than they can account for. He won't talk about any of this to anyone.
He pretends it didn't happen, but my family and I know what we saw." Now,
when these photos were developed, the photos on the film that were not showing
the UFO were fine, but every single photo that was taken of this UFO was
overexposed to the point that it showed nothing. As the sister says, quite a few others saw this UFO, and everyone I have
spoken with agrees with my description. An investigator came to our house and spoke with everyone individually, and we
drew pictures of the object. I haven't seen one since, but I check the skies
nightly. Here's another really interesting case. Just 6 years later, 1:10 a.m. on July 10, 1981,
three sisters, Hazel Desetre, Hilda Helms, and Glattis McKon were driving
along Town Street near the 10mm River. You can see this location here. They
were returning home after playing a game of cards, and Hazel was the first to notice what looked like an unusually
bright star. But then, suddenly, this star-like object swooped down over their
car and revealed itself to be a classic flying saucer with a bright light in the
center, and it hovered over their car for several minutes. And as Hazel says,
it was the first one I had seen. Glattis was really excited. She wanted to leave
because she thought she would be kidnapped by UFO aliens from outer space. So, they were quite relieved when
this object moved off. Always another case 5 years later. This next case
involves four witnesses. This was amazing. It occurred at 8:30
p.m. on December 15, 1986. A group of witnesses were returning from
a Christmas shopping trip. a mother and her three daughters. And as they drove
along Reed Street, you can see it here, they noticed two very bright lights
descending over a field. I believe this is the exact location cuz they described
an old farm there and high tension wires. And you can certainly see them. They thought that this object might be
an aircraft making an emergency landing. So the mother slowed down the car. And
at this point, this object leveled off and moved directly towards the witnesses. As one of them writes in a
report, quote, "The object was silver, an immense disc with a big reddish
bulging light on the bottom and little white lights around its widest section."
So, this object hovered. Their mom was absolutely fascinated, but the three daughters began to panic. They were
actually crying and begging for their mother to just drive away. But for some reason, she didn't, almost as if she was
entranced. This craft was totally silent, was hovering no more than 80
feet overhead and just in front of their car. So, the mother at this point began to slowly move the car forward. And this
object slowly moved forward along with it and then darted over to a grove of
trees where it hovered for about 15 seconds. At this point, the lights on the object changed color and the object
darted away at high speed. And as the witness says, we were all very shaken
and upset. We went home and my mother immediately called the police. The local
police station literally answered the phone UFO hotline in a joking manner. My
mother reluctantly told the officer about our sighting and he indicated that there had been many calls that night and
that an officer was sent to check things out. Now, the next day, the local paper
printed a story saying something interesting that the power on Reed Street where they had been had gone out
and that the cause, according to the paper, was due to a squirrel eating through the power box. Now, as the
witness says, I've been reluctant to share my experience with others simply because of the stigma that comes along
with such an admission. I don't know what we encountered that night, but to
this day, I've never seen anything like it, nor have I ever seen any technology
that comes close to what we saw that December night. Amazing.
Here's another amazing case. 10:10 p.m. July 10, 2010. A family of four was
driving home along with their friends who were in a separate car. And as they headed down Landry Avenue towards Kelly
Boulevard near the vicinity of Joseph Martin Elementary School, you can see
the exact location here. This is when they noticed five or six objects low in
the sky. So, they kept their eyes on them as they drove. These objects were very low and much brighter than any
other stars. And as they arrived home just a short distance away, the
witnesses got out and looked at these objects. There were now three of them almost directly overhead. They estimate
maybe a thousand ft high. They were reddish orange and now close enough that
they could see a distinct dome shape. They made no noise. So he called the
police who said that they had received no calls. But he did call his friends who were in the car ahead of them and
they confirmed that yes, they had also seen these objects and did not know what they were. So there you go. That's the
UFO history of Attelboroough, Massachusetts. Thank you, Katherine Shakrew. I love exploring these
locations and finding cases there. There's just something really gratifying about it. And I've said this before, but
it bears repeating. The fact that there are UFOs being seen in pretty much, as
far as I can tell, every single town or city or location on this planet has
profound implications. One being that it's quite likely. UFO encounters are
far more common than we realize. And you have to ask yourself, why are the UFO
occupants doing this? Why are they showing themselves at every location on
this planet? Is this just something they're studying or is this intentional? These are the kinds of questions that we
really don't have answers to. We can only speculate, but it sure does look
like they want us to know that we are not alone. That would be my major
takeaway from the this whole series of episodes that I'm doing. Uh if
UFOs are being seen everywhere, there has to be a reason for this. And again, the four cases I found in Attleboroough,
not even 1%, I am sure there's probably 400 cases if you were to really dig down
and go doortodoor and put up flyers and ads in newspapers. You could write a whole book about what's going on in any
of these locations. I certainly could for this next location, which really
shocked me. I found so many very interesting cases. This next location I
will be covering is Aahu, Hawaii. This is by special request of Janna Laviel.
Thank you, Jana. Wow, was this interesting. I have been to Hawaii
before. It's a beautiful place. I actually went to Maui. Uh Aahu has some
really interesting facts to it. There's about a million people who live there. Now, that's 70% of the population of all
the Hawaiian islands combined. So, Aahu is very, very popular. It's 597
square miles. Not huge huge, but in fact, it's the third largest of the
Hawaiian Islands. Get this. It's 97% undeveloped. So, there's a lot of really
wild land there. And if you look at it, you can see why. Very steep mountains, very dense jungles and forests, and so
beautiful. If you guys ever get a chance to visit the Hawaiian Islands, do it. It's so amazing. Aahu does have the most
beaches of all the islands. It's of course famous for Pearl Harbor and the
city of Honolulu. I found about two dozen cases. So amazing. Every single
kind of case you can imagine has occurred in Aahu. Amazing sightings, a huge super fleet.
Wait, do you hear that case? It's astonishing. But landings as well, USOS,
humanoids by I mean gosh, so many humanoid cases and some onboard cases as
well. So again, the entire range reaching all the way back to, get this,
1924, pretty much up to the current day. There was quite a few cases I just didn't
cover because again, I could write an entire book about what's going on in
just Aahu. Maybe one day I will. That would be an interesting book. UFOs over Hawaii. Don't think it's been written
yet, but surely it would be an important contribution to this field. So, let's
just get started with Aahu. Thank you, Jana. This was so interesting to me. Earliest case I could find in Aahu
actually involves humanoids and boy is it strange. This comes from a gentleman
by the name of Cidro El Basa. and he wrote a letter to Ray Palmer, a
researcher and publisher, and says that in 1924 while on Sand Island, this is a small
island about 2 miles from the shore of Aahu, he was 8 years old at the time and was
playing hookie from school with a friend. They were going to collect some crabs and they spent much of the day
collecting all these crabs. And around 400 p.m. Cidro's friend left. But Cidro
stayed hoping to catch more crabs. And he says as soon as his friend left,
Cidro noticed a what looked like a canoe to him with three very small children
and a dog approaching the sand island and landed at the shore and got out.
Now, Cidro was really surprised to see such small children in a canoe cuz there was no adult around and he was curious
as he says. I was curious and went to them. I approached the one who was sitting down and as I came closer he had
his face to the back of me. So, I told him and I said, "Hey, where's your
mother?" And as he turned around his head and looked at me, his face was that
of an adult, but old and wrinkled. I didn't wait for him to answer. I turned
around and ran as fast as my feet could carry me, and fled for my dear life. I
left everything behind me, including my crabs. I could not forget this. Those
little people that I saw were a little smaller than the midgets in the circus.
So, I don't know. Very strange case. You can make up your own mind about it. But
this next case has to be one of the most bizarre humanoid encounters on record.
So make of it what you will, but it was researched by Donald Worley and Leonard
Stringfield who spoke directly with the witness and they are respected researchers. We now know the witness to
be Edward Langanger Jr. He was initially anonymous. He was a construction
engineer with the Navy. And he reports that on the morning of June 18, 1944,
he was walking along the beach near Kano High Naval Air Station. This is on Aahu
and he was hunting for shells. And this is when a glint of light on a metallic
object in the nearby trees caught his eye. So he approached and was astonished
to see a 50-foot wide craft. Almost iglooshaped is how he said it. As Edward
says, it looked like an igloo and on top of the clear dome was a gold device much
like a weather vein. This was encased in a transparent dome. and he said the
surface of the craft was hawkmarked kind of like the skin of an orange but absolutely intentional and otherwise
smooth. Most astonishing was that surrounding this craft was a group of 4ft tall thin humanoids. They were each
wearing green jumpsuits and he says they looked very much humanlike but had short
thick black hair, large dark eyes, very heavy eyebrows. One of them looked like
they had sharp insizers, almost like fangs. Now, each of these was wearing a
belt with a small boxshaped object on the belt. They appeared to be surprised
by Edward, and they showed great interest in him, and one began to speak to him in a deep voice with a heavy
accent, which was odd because to Edward it didn't look like that kind of voice
could come out of one of these figures. Immediately, one of these figures pressed a button on this box on his
belt, which made Edward feel instantly dizzy and nauseated. And it was at this
moment that one of the figures actually lunged at Edward with what Edward said
appeared to be almost a sword-like weapon. Feeling threatened, Edward pulled out his knife, and the two began
to fight. Now, being of much larger size, Edward was fairly easily able to
pin this little man to the ground. at which point the other crew mates joined the fry and to Edward's surprise they
actually terminated the life of this crew mate who had just attacked him. Now as this all happened Edward says that he
grabbed the black box from the belt of this creature and quickly hid it in his pocket. Meanwhile, after all of this
calmed down, one of the crew mates told Edward to leave and return the next day at this location and they would speak to
him further. So that's what Edward did. He returned the next day and these apparent ETs said that they had come
from another world which was located about 21 light years away and they were
checking on a colonization effort that they had carried out eons ago here on
planet Earth. And per Edward, they talked for about 4 hours about all kinds
of things. The ETSs told him that they would be in that location for the next 3
days and they asked him to keep his encounter a secret which he did or tried
to do. But unknown to Edward, there was another witness. Another soldier saw
this encounter and actually told authorities ratted out on Edward. Edward
was immediately confronted by his superiors who forced him to reveal the location of this encounter. Though
Edward did, he was also forced to give up this apparent alien artifact. And Edward was later told that the Navy did
in fact ambush this UFO crew, most of who were able to flee into the craft
except for one crew member who was captured. Uh the Navy told him that they
had also captured the craft itself, which was taken to San Diego for study.
But per Edward, they told him they were never able to open this craft. And
again, they did take this black box-like artifact. It had three buttons on it. They said they tested one on a cat. This
cat immediately was kind of liquefied and fell dead instantly and burned the
area where the cat had sat. Now, this witness kept his encounter secret for a
very long time, would tell nobody except his own family, but 26 years later in
1970, he agreed to be interviewed by Don Wley and later Leonard Stringfield. And
he's apparently quite sincere about this account. He's never changed his story. The investigators were very much
impressed by his honesty and sincerity. But yeah, you can make up your own mind about it. It's definitely a very unusual
case and it's certainly not the only one on Oahu. One case I found is very brief.
March 14, 1950, Mr. R. Chunin said that he was working in the fields at Kyoo
when he says he saw a round silver disc just coasting leisurely through the sky
to the northeast and behind it it was trailing this sort of trail of quote
smaller shining streaks. Here's a really interesting encounter which occurred one night in 1952.
This comes from a newsman, a very credible witness, and it was written up in the January 1956 issue of the Flying
Saucer Review. This anonymous newsman and his friend Tom were taking a drive
around Oahu and stopped at the very famous Halona blowhole. This is an area
where the ocean comes in and creates a kind of geyser effect. So, they were looking at this and this is when they
noticed a star-like light moving across the sky. And I'll just let the anonymous
newsman describe what happened next. As he says, "The light suddenly changed
direction and sped back across the same path it had just followed. My heart
flip-flopped and we bolted from the car and dashed down to the very end of the lookout. The light bobbed, danced,
pirouetted, and described almost geometric maneuvers directly in front of us. So they watched this in astonishment
for about 5 minutes, at which point this object reversed its course, shot up
vertically, then dove down over a boat, actually skimmed the surface of the
ocean, and then spiraled upwards in a weird corkcrew fashion and was gone.
Now, they later learned that they weren't the only witnesses. Reportedly, some hundred people saw this. Others
described seeing a giant fireball like object over Kyua. But as the witness
says, there's the story. Now, you tell me what I've seen. Tell me I'm a lunatic
or that my two sightings were Venus or weather balloons or temperature inversions, but I won't believe you.
Now, it turned out that this newsman had a friend who was a highly placed scientist in Washington, DC. And this
friend told him that despite government denials, the folks in Washington DC know
exactly who the visitors are, why they're here, and considerable information about their culture. His
friend would say no more, saying that he was under a security oath. Moving on,
that same year, just before noon on February 10, 1952, Wifred Anderson of 3365 Monaloa Avenue
and her sister Helen Anderson, who lived next door, observed a glowing quote half
dome shaped object. They said it was shiny like aluminum. It stre into a
cloud and then it reappeared. And as Winterfred says, "This time we saw two
of them. The second one was a little smaller and traveling below the big one." She said it moved way faster than
any plane, but it looked to her too small to carry any passengers. She did
report it to the police and later two reporters saying, quote, "I've never
seen anything like this before." Not another case. One month later, it was 3
to 4 a.m. March 6, 1952, Naval Officer James Cunel reported for watch at the
Barber's Point Naval Air Station on Oahu. This is a military base. He had
just gotten there when he noticed a very bright object hovering only 150 ft away
and about 150 ft high directly over the air strip. He said it was a circular
object. You can see his drawing here. He estimates it was 50 to 60 ft across with
a flat bottom, tapered sides, and a dome on top. He said it glowed with a very
intense brightness and was hovering almost motionless and completely silent
for a full 3 minutes right over the air strip. It then darted out towards the
ocean at fantastic speed. Now, James did not report the object to his superiors,
but he learned that the other officers who were there already on watch also saw
it and they did report it to their superiors and they told him that they
were told not to say anything to anyone. This is exactly how so many cases go
completely unreported by the mainstream media because our government is covering this up. Here's another very interesting
case from a military officer. January 16, 1953, 6:30 a.m. A yman third class
assigned to Pearl Harbor was driving on Nimttz Highway in Honolulu when he says
he saw a very bright circular object moving at very high speed over Pearl
Harbor for a full 3 minutes. He said it made no sound, but what was weird is
this object had no visible propulsion system. And despite the witness's
considerable experience in observing aircraft, he said that this object did not in any way resemble anything he had
ever seen. He was flatout unable to identify it. Now, this next case has got
to be one of the strangest I've heard in this whole entire episode. I can imagine
that this particular case is not more well-known because it involves a massive
super fleet of UFOs. These kinds of cases are exceedingly rare. But on
August 5, 1953, starting at 5:00 p.m., very large
numbers of UFOs began to appear over again Barber's Point, Pearl Harbor,
directly over this naval air station. They first appeared as glowing lights
maneuvering at high speed and doing amazing maneuvers. The radar stations
immediately picked up on these objects which were also clearly visible to pilots and people on the ground
including control tower operators. And this was not a brief sighting. This went
on for hours and hours. And at one point, get this, no less than 75 objects
were seen darting around. At 900 p.m., a Navy patrol plane said that a UFO made a
head pass right at them, not once, not twice, but three times in a row,
alarming the pilot to such a degree that he made a very quick landing at Barber Field. But still, the activity
continued. In fact, eight hours later, these objects were still up there. And
during all of this time, the Navy was sending up planes to try to intercept them unsuccessfully. At 211 a.m., they
sent up a TV1 interceptor to try to intercept an object. And the pilot said
one of these objects appeared below his plane, then darted upwards and actually trailed his jet just 100 ft behind him
very briefly, but then pulled up right alongside him and paced his aircraft for
about 4 seconds, then darted away at several times faster than the jet's top
speed. Now, this particular pilot immediately landed. He was reportedly
pale and extremely frightened to the point that he just kept repeating over and over, "I actually saw him. I
actually saw him." Now, whether he saw an actual ET is unknown, but I do wonder
why he's saying him as opposed to it or the UFO. At any rate, this story was
leaked in a letter to researcher Donald Kho, but never did appear in Project Blue Book. it was effectively covered
up. Now, coincidentally or not, this was a significant date because on August 5,
1953, the day of this encounter, this is when the Soviets detonated their first
thermonuclear weapon called Joe 4 was on that very day. Another significant event
on that day was operation big switch. This is when the United Nations reached
an agreement and they released some 75,000 prisoners of war who were sent back to
their home country. So, I wonder about this if this was somehow in a response
to that. Here's another case of a UFO landing. It occurred 3 years later on
January 6, 1956. Seven people were on a hillside in Honolulu. They were located at 2420
Yim Moa Road in Kyimuki. You can see their location here. And this is when
they noticed an object hovering at about 1500 ft overhead. This was kind of at their eye level. It was a discshaped
object. They said 100 ft wide with quote unusual color characteristics.
They said that it had a quote red nucleus surrounded with a glow which changed through a variety of colors. So
as they watched this object, it hovered in place. They observed it through binoculars and it remained there in
place until another aircraft approached. Now the main witness was a military
observer and as he says, "We saw the thing for 45 minutes. It was a beautiful
100 ft diameter perfect disc. He said that when the plane arrived, the disc
quote suddenly came to the ground on a bare spot where there aren't any houses.
He said then said it took off at high speed so fast it was kind of trailing red sparks and was gone. Here's another
case. Same year, couple of months later, March 5, 1956. Mr. William L. Wanil and his wife were
driving south on 10th Avenue in Honolulu when they saw quote three large lights.
They were very low, 200 feet altitude they estimate. William quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a photograph. You
can see the photograph here. And although this photo is printed in black and white, it is in fact a color
photograph. And the color image shows that this object was leaving a trail of
blue and green and yellow light paths. Draft itself was roughly the shape of a
potato, he said. And it was making tight turns in mere milliseconds. And it
traveled so fast the 1/8 second exposure still showed the object as trailing. So
many cases. Here's one. March 11, 1963 at 8:00 p.m. an aircraft was traveling
at 40,000 ft about 40 miles west of Honolulu when they saw a brilliant light
that was moving quote very fast and quote much higher than their altitude.
Again, they're at 40,000 ft. And this was reportedly observed by many other people. There is a possibility that this
could be the new A11 aircraft we now know as the Blackbird, which can reach
heights of 70,000 feet, move like 2,000 mph.
But this is contradicted by some witnesses who said that this object actually dove down into the water of the
ocean. So, I don't know. It's very odd. Here's another case. This one's so
interesting. A very unusual humanoid encounter. This comes from the February 1965 issue
of Fate magazine. The witness is Mark Chu, age 11. He says
that at 5:00 p.m. on October 22nd, 1964, he was watering his lawn at Wa Aahu,
when he saw what he describes as a 3 foot tall little man. This was not a
normal person. He was wearing a red cape, a malo. This is a Hawaiian loin
cloth and a peaked white helmet. This little man kind of smiled at him, then
walked around the corner of the house and promptly vanished. Now, an inspection of the area where
this little man had been did reveal two sets of tiny footprints. In fact, they
could see these footprints climbing the wall at the picture window of the house. Now, on March 17, 1965,
the Oahu Police Station fielded a series of calls from all across Honolulu from
residents reporting UFOs. One witness was BJ Lam of 1322
Moku Place in Maki Ki. He called the police to say that at 6 p.m. he saw a
UFO flying over the mountains. Another report came from Henry Yamada at 280
Mumuku Place in Kulio, and he said that at around 8:30 p.m., he
saw a glowing red object hovering overhead for a period of about 10 minutes. Amazing how many encounters
there are. Here's a highly credible case which took place about 2 years later,
January 23rd, 1967. And this involves at least seven police
officers, several commercial pilots, and the crew of a ship, all of who reported
seeing some sort of strange craft. It was first seen by police at 5:50 a.m.
who said they viewed it for 6 minutes and described it as quote, "a bright yellow orange light similar to a star
except for its color. It was centered in a circular blue mist and about 100 times
larger than the light." 4 minutes later, a second object with two bright lights was seen. Now, here's a case which is so
unusual. This one involves a humanoid and onboard encounter. The whole deal
was 5:00 a.m. one spring morning in 1971 that Robert D. Miles, you can see him
here, he was on board his 47 foot trimmer, which was docked at Alawawaii
Yacht Harbor. And he says he was taken on board a UFO. At the time, he was
lying in his bunk and suddenly his stateateroom filled with shimmering lights and he felt this intense wave of
tingling energy sweep over him. Moments later, a beautiful woman appeared.
Robert, at this point, as you can imagine, wondered if he was dreaming or hallucinating. But then the woman took
his hand and began to speak to him. And he realized he was awake and this was actually happening. And he asked her,"Wh
have you come to me?" And she said, "Myself and others like me are friends,
and we want you to come to a very important briefing." Robert agreed. He felt that this figure
was very friendly, and the next thing he knew, without any idea how he got there,
he found himself transported somehow to New York City. There he boarded a saucer-shaped craft where he was with a
group of some 50 other people from Earth and all of them were being shown by the
ETSs a vision of Earth's history and of Earth's future events. The he does not
go into detail in his report but does later write about this. The ETSs did
tell him he had a mission to share his experience. He said this briefing took
several hours and he said when he was returned to his boat only 33 minutes had
passed. He later did become a UFO researcher and he wrote about this
account in a semifictional book entitled Safe Space. You can see it here. He said
it was very much inspired by his encounter and as he writes much of it is
contained within this safe space story. Now, here is an amazing case involving a
very well-verified and authenticated UFO photograph. This took place in April of
1974 at Capiolari Park east of Honolulu. A
professional photographer was there. His name is Sutou Nakayyama and he was
taking photos of a traditional hoola dance. Now, he was very much focused on the dancers and did not notice anything
unusual. But when he had his photos developed, he was shocked because one of
them showed a very clear image of a shiny metallic silver disc low in the
sky was racing across the sky at kind of an angle. Now his camera was a
Hasselblad 500C with a rapid shutter speed of 1 250th of a second, though a
very high shutter speed. In an analysis of this photograph by researchers and experts showed no evidence of trickery.
It clearly wasn't a lens flare or anything like this. It appeared to show a solid object some distance from the
camera which they estimated was somewhere between 30 to 35 ft in diameter. This is widely believed by UFO
researchers to be a genuine photograph of a classic flying saucer. Next case,
one year later, May 5th, 1975, a couple was going through Kalama Valley
in Aahu, and they saw something they could not explain. They pulled off the road to watch it. And as the wife says,
she's a stewardist, quite familiar with aircraft. As she says, it was huge. It
had an awful lot of lights all over it. Was shaped like a triangle in front and in back. There were no wings. It was
just one solid mass. It made a real loud humming noise and then sometimes you wouldn't hear it and then it would make
the humming noise again. It had two big headlights and underneath it was filled
with lights, maybe two dozen or more. They were kind of glowing white lights, some red and green lights. All of them
were blinking on and off. My husband and I kept looking at each other. We couldn't believe it. I've always felt
that it was possible there were UFOs, but my husband was a disbeliever. He's
not now. Now, by coincidence, Jay Allen Heinik had just arrived on the island.
So, that's kind of interesting. But the wife says of her sighting, "It was really beautiful. It wasn't a plane. It
was a machine." That same year, September 8, 1975, numerous people in Aahu and in fact the
other islands reported seeing a very large cigar- shaped or cylindrical
shaped object very high in the sky. They said it was glowing a very bright
orange. All of the witnesses said that it was ejecting some kind of luminous material. It was visible only for a few
brief moments, but after it departed, they could see this glowing silvery gold
white gas, which remained visible for some time. It was just a few weeks later
at 5:30 a.m. on September 29, that three members of a family in Manoa, Honolulu,
described their sighting of a crystal white cigar-shaped object. Now, they used binoculars and they could see that
this object, in fact, had four port holes and was emitting brilliant beams of light. They said it made a loud
roaring noise as it was making tight maneuvers for a period of almost an hour
before finally moving off. Here is a very concerning case. Really
interesting. One evening in 1992, a married couple, Doug and Sandy, were
vacationing on Oahu. And they were driving along a remote road when something very unusual happened. They
said this large white owl flew up to their windshield close enough to almost
graze it. He actually stopped the car and got out, got back inside, and when
they arrived home, they realized they were experiencing a period of missing
time. But later he spontaneously recalled what happened during this missing time. He remembered that this
owl was not an owl at all. Was actually a glowing humanoid figure. He had gotten
out of his car and spoke to this figure face to face. And this figure telepathically communicated all kinds of
information. This figure warned him about future
events on Earth. That Earth would experience a global existential crisis
involving war, disease, environmental upheavalss, famines, and more. It showed
him a vision of people being herded into concentration camps. This figure told him that the grays would appear
worldwide at some point and that everyone would welcome them. This figure said that the grays would ultimately
interbreed with humans to create human gray hybrids who would alter the
spiritual evolution of the human race. Next case, same year, 6:50 a.m.
September 10, a woman said she was driving to work early in the morning on a busy highway in Honolulu. And this is
when she noticed an object hovering directly above the freeway. She said it was very odd. It looked hexagonal in
shape. was definitely solid. Looked sort of a dull aluminum gray. And get this,
was only about 500 ft ahead. Pretty large, about the size of two helicopters. Definitely not a
helicopter. But what really surprised her is that although the highway was very busy with traffic, nobody else
seemed to be paying any attention whatsoever to this object. She watched it for just a few moments as it moved
off slowly at about 50 mph and was out of sight. Next case involves humanoids.
It's very short on detail, but certainly interesting. This comes from researcher Glennice McKay. Reportedly, one day in
1995, a group of seven witnesses were near Honolulu walking across the beach when
they saw this female figure more than 7 feet tall walking with very long strides
away from a large craft. Now, they had seen this craft off in the distance, but
all of them just assumed it was a strange house of some kind until they saw this strange lady. She did not look
normal. Not only was she 7t tall, she had very white skin, long black curly
hair, and was dressed strangely. She was wearing a white tunic down to her knees,
long white boots. Unfortunately, there's no other information on this case, but
certainly sounds unusual. Couple of more. January 26, 2007 at 6:20 p.m., a
crowd of people gathered at Koala Basin and Alam Moana Beach to view two
fireball like lights circling overhead. One of the witnesses was Peter
Hollingsworth. And he told reporters that these objects quote looked kind of like a shooting
star, but it just kept going. They changed direction a few times. I was a
little concerned. It looked deadly to me. Now, a videotape was allegedly taken of the objects. I couldn't find it, but
it was impressive enough with enough witnesses that the National Weather Service and the FAA were contacted. Both
claimed to have no information. Astronomy professor Gareth Wyn Williams
of the University of Hawaii said, and I quote, "This is in a sense a UFO. It's
something in the sky that's moving that we haven't identified. One final case.
This took place at 3:00 a.m. on May 1st, 2023 at Makaha, Oahu, when a woman at Kaio
Beach noticed a very strange object hovering at low elevation directly in front of her. She described it as two
three-sided pyramids attached base to base. It was about 8 ft long, 2 ft wide,
almost transparent, but had this dim orange light in the center. She viewed
it for just a few moments when it suddenly vanished. So, how about that?
Cases from 1924 all the way to 2023. So many cases. I can't thank you enough,
Janna Janna Laviel, for suggesting this location. It really made me want to
write an entire book about this location. That's how many cases there
are. And I just had to at some point stop and say, "This is enough." But what
a rich, varied, amazing history of UFO encounters Aahu has. Really amazing. So,
thank you again, Jana. I hope you found it interesting. Now, let's move to the last and final location in this episode.
I wish I could cover more than five uh locations in this episode. I usually go
for 10, but I just found so many cases. And this next location is no exception.
This one is Morgan, North Carolina by special request of Richard Minish. Thank
you, Richard. Really, really interesting. Morgan isn't a huge city.
It's rather a smalish town of some 18,000 people. It's called nature's
playground. That's its sort of nickname. And if you study this area, you'll see why. It's in the Blue Ridge Mountains.
It has incredibly scenic areas, lots of parks, just a beautiful, beautiful
location. I found about a half dozen cases that I think are really worth
mentioning, cases that should be widely known. I did find some humanoid cases as
well, but wow, some of these cases are just so astonishing. So, thank you,
Richard. I hope you find this location interesting in terms of its UFO history.
Morgant is a pretty small town. Currently, about 17,000 people. It's
probably best known for being near the Brown Mountain Lights. This is these are
famous earth lights. I'm not going to cover that here. That would take a whole episode, but it definitely has some very
interesting UFO cases, which are clearly not Earth lights. Now, this first one I
did cover before in my episode on schoolyard UFO encounters, but it's worth repeating. This one is very
poignant. It was about 7:30 p.m. on a mid-March evening in 1979
that two students and a dorm teacher exited the dorms at the North Carolina
School for the Deaf. You can see it here. They were just out there to put some trash in a dumpster. And looking
up, they saw some quote strange lights approaching from the north, but they were at very low altitude. And in fact,
they were so low that they were actually dipping down into the valley where this school is located. And the lights just
kept approaching closer and closer. They were blue in color and brilliant to the
point of being almost blinding. So the teacher ran back inside to get more witnesses. And when he returned outside,
these lights, this object was so close to the back of the dorm that he felt it
might quote slam into the building. Now, at the very last moment, this object
rose upward and avoided the building. But the witnesses could now see that this object had three bright lights on
the front side, and as it passed overhead, they noticed three additional lights on the rear.
Meanwhile, the dorm director was up on the third floor of the building. And as he says, I was on the third floor and I
heard a real strange noise. At first, I didn't pay much attention, but then I heard all this screaming and hollering
going on. He said this sound was like a woo woo woo with a kind of wavering vibration. And here's where it gets so
interesting because several of the deaf children could physically feel this strange vibration of this object as it
passed overhead. About 10 10 to 15 students and adults witnessed this craft
moving over the building then disappearing over the treetops. Now about 2 hours later at 9:30 p.m. five
additional witnesses spotted more mysterious lights. This was over the valley between Broton Hospital and of
course the adjacent North Carolina School for the Deaf. They pulled in brilliance, moved vertically and
horizontally at high speed, then zipped off to the south, disappearing over the horizon. And as one of the witnesses
said, people weren't really scared. They were more puzzled and excited. On the
morning of December 18, 1980, three reports came from people driving along
Highway 18 just north of Morgan. They actually called the police to report
UFOs. One woman said she saw a bright orange UFO hovering at treetop level
appearing and disappearing. And she told them, "I'm not drunk because I don't
drink, but I've just been seeing the damnedest thing. a great big bright
orange thing with smaller UFOs on each side of it. The great big one stops and
the smaller things come up on each side. Then the smaller ones take off. The big thing follows but comes back repeating
the same pattern. Now, another witness said that he saw several small saucershaped objects flying above the
trees and then these smaller objects would fly into an open doorway on a much
larger saucer-shaped object hovering nearby. Now, here's a truly amazing sighting which occurred in the summer of
1981. A 12-year-old boy and his nine-year-old friend were playing outside in their
carport when, as he says, quote, "Something caused us both to turn and
look towards the backyard. Neither of them could believe their eyes." As the witness says, there hovering 15 to 20
feet off the ground was a dull metallic VW bug-sized craft with pulsating red,
green, and blue lights. The object was curved on the side facing us. We were at
eye level with the object and was very close, approximately 10 to 15 ft away,
hovering there as if it was observing or studying us. We were both in shock for several seconds and stood there
speechless. It made a worring sound. I was terribly frightened by this craft,
as was my companion. We both came to our senses and ran into the house. So, at
this point, they screamed frantically at their parents for several moments until they were finally taken seriously.
Everyone at this point rushed outside, but by then, the strange craft was gone.
The witness did report the sighting to MUN more than 35 years later and says,
and I quote, "This incident has stayed with me to this day. I know what I saw
that day was something very unusual." Now, here's a shorter report, but somewhat similar. This comes from Robin
Church. was at 10:19 a.m. on October 29, 1990 that she says she saw two
oval-shaped objects which appeared to be drawn together by a barlike device. And
as the witness says, the entire object was the length of a small car. She says
it hovered about 300 ft off the ground for just three or four minutes before
disappearing. Now, here's a dramatic case reported by the witness to Mufon. It was 7:30 one evening in December
1993. A layer of snow was on the ground and the witness was putting wood into his
wood stove in his home. And looking out the window into the backyard, he noticed
that the entire yard was glowing this eerie red color. Now, he first assumed
his chimney was on fire, so he screamed out a warning. And he and his mother rushed out onto the deck. And looking up
at the chimney, he saw that it was not on fire. It was fine, but the whole backyard was still illuminated by this
weird red light. And now looking up, he could see why. As the witness says, I
saw a bright red round object over my backyard. It looked like a red spotlight, but big. I would say it was
about 100 yards above the backyard. The exact size is hard to describe due to
the brightness of the light, as if looking into a spotlight, but it was bigger than a full-size van. It hovered
there for a few seconds and shot straight up, faster than anything I have ever seen. A loud boom followed and it
disappeared in less than a second or two. The speed was indescribable. One curious thing is that it did not
emit any sound, only the boom as it went up. Now, of course, his mother saw all
of this, too. And at the sound of this loud boom, his next door neighbor came running out and asked the witness if he
had just shot a gun, which of course the witness said no. Now, the witness was a
former sergeant in the army. He had two combat tours. He seen plenty of action.
He said that this object moved far faster than a missile. Here's another case involving a solid craft. Four
people were driving along the highway towards Brown Mountain just outside of Morgan in hopes of seeing the famous
Earth lights, but instead they saw a very strange craft. They said it was 11
p.m. one evening in early 2000, and as the witness says, a golden
boomerang-shaped UFO appeared in the sky just above my windshield on the left. He
said it paced their car in perfect sink for about 30 seconds. Then suddenly it
did something even stranger. As the witness says, the triangle shape split into three golden orbs that flew off in
different directions. I truly felt that it was being playful and wanted to put on a show. Now he insists these were not
the brown mountain lights which they had been hoping to see, but instead quote got a beautiful show that I will cherish
for the rest of my life. This next case is so odd. I think we should take it seriously. It was reported to Muon 13
years after it occurred by a man who at the time of his encounter was incarcerated at the Foothills
Correctional Facility in Morgan, North Carolina. You can see it here. Per this
witness, Kevin G, he was serving a 24-year sentence for seconddegree murder, which he says he's actually
innocent of. He did not commit the murder, but was an unwilling accessorary. It was his codefendant who
actually committed the crime. At any rate, per Kevin, his encounter occurred
on December 6, 2006. And as he says, and I quote, "On this
particular night, I was in my cell. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a light
coming towards the building. At first, I thought it was an airplane because there's an airport nearby. But something
told me to look. A light was coming over the trees. I said to myself, "That's too
low for an airplane unless it was about to crash." And then I said, "Helicopter." And then I noticed there
was no noise coming from it at all. It like floated over the treetops just high
enough to clear the top of the prison I was in, which was a five-story building. I could not tell the shape of it because
it was that bright. As it got closer, it appeared to have windows on the side.
And as I looked hard to see if there was anyone inside, I saw four beings at the
window of the craft looking out. I said to myself, "No way. There's no way. I
just witnessed a UFO." I tried to shove it out of my mind, but I felt scared.
And I'm a type of person who does not get scared at anything. I have been out of prison for two years now and I just
got the guts to tell this. The reason why I have never told this to anyone is
because I felt like I would have been deemed a crazy lunatic. I do not know if
anyone else has reported seeing anything at that date. But I do know what I saw.
I just wanted to tell my story and hope it sheds some light or at least have someone look in to see if there was any
other reports around that time just to put my mind at rest to let me know I am
not crazy. So I couldn't find any confirmation of this report. But I will say I did a whole episode on UFOs over
prisons and definitely UFOs are attracted to prisons. There are sightings, there are landings, there are
many other humanoid reports. So, I think that this is a report again that should be taken seriously. There you go,
Richard. That's what I found in Morgan, North Carolina.
I'm going to say what I've said already. Not all the cases that I found are all
the cases that actually exist. We know as UFO researchers that most people do
not report their encounters. That's especially true if they've seen humanoids or been taken on board or if
the case involves high strangeness. Uh so any estimates as to how common these
types of encounters are vastly underestimated. So yeah, I found just a few in Morgan,
North Carolina. I'm sure there are hundreds and hundreds of them. Not even
kidding. But so interesting. And once again, my point is proven. UFOs are
being seen in every location on this planet. I am going through my list of a
thousand, almost a thousand locations and have covered well over a hundred at this point. And I know there are some of
you out there who are waiting very patiently for your town or city to be
covered. So, thank you for your patience. I'm getting there. Some of these locations are very difficult to
research. So, I truly appreciate you guys being patient with that. And for
those of you who would like to suggest a location for me to research, please do
feel free to do so. Uh, again, it's going to take me some time to get to all
of these locations, but I so love doing it. I've said it's a lot of work, but I
really can't call it work when it's so interesting and so much fun. So, thank
you guys. I hope you've enjoyed episode 13 of UFOs in Your Hometown. It's always
so interesting to see all these new cases that I've never heard before, and I think most of you probably haven't. I
get a good number of these from little newspapers and obscure UFO databases.
So, this is why it's so hard for me to do this particular series of episodes of
UFOs in your hometown. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. Hope you've enjoyed it. Hope you learned something
new. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for
the truth. Most important, keep having fun. And yeah, feel free to send me your
location and I will look it up. I'll see you next Friday. Bye for now.
