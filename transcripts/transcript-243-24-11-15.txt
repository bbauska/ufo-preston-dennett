UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE SIX
Nov 15, 2024

Summary:
Nov 15, 2024
The challenge continues! Name any town or city, and the chances are almost 100% that a UFO encounter has occurred there. In early 2024, I put out this challenge. So far, there have been cases in every single location. Episode six presents ten new locations, each with a history of encounters. These locations include Benson, Arizona; Greensboro, North Carolina; Edwardsburg, Michigan; Bedfordshire, UK; Chicoutimi, Canada; Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Asheville, North Carolina; Skagway/Juneau, Alaska and Bradenton, Florida. Sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences, many supported by evidence such as photos, radar-returns, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, and more! The truth can no longer be denied: UFOs are real!

BENSON, AZ. In 1952, flight commander Chick Logan and many others were at Marana Airbase when a UFO appeared overhead. Chick took off in his plane to intercept the object. Although it was too high to reach, he did verify that it was not a balloon. Four years later in 1956, a fleet of a dozen objects move over Benson, alerting the Ground Observers Corp. In 2022, a Benson resident captured an anomalous light on an automatic camera outside his home.

GREENSBORO, NC. In May 1930, Joseph Rankin and his wife were shocked when a UFO landed in the backyard. Even more shocking, they saw a humanoid inside. In 1946, two solders had a closeup observations of three disc-shaped objects. More sightings occurred in 1952, 1955, 1963 and 1966. That same year, teenager David Oldham was taken onboard a craft and examined by gray-type ETs. The sightings continued, including several photographic cases.

EDWARDSBURG, MI. This small town produced a few dramatic case, including three events in 2008 alone, each involving solid objects moving in anomalous ways. In one case, a gentleman described a triangular craft which swooped mere feet above his car. In 2022, a man saw what he thought was a shooting star, until it made a right turn and zipped up and away.

BEDFORDSHIRE, UK. In 1956, shopkeeper John Whitworth was visited by an unusual-looking gentleman who gave him directions to a UFO sighting, beginning a strange adventure that almost led to direct contact. One year later, pilot John Jordan had two close-up sightings in a row. In 1962, two young sisters watched a UFO hover over their backyard, and inside they saw two humanoids. Many other cases, including an entire family who experienced missing time.

CHICOUTIMI, QUEBEC, CANADA. In April 1968, Mrs. Tremblay saw a UFO outside her home, and minutes later, saw a short humanoid. In 1970, Mrs. Desneige described a UFO which hovered directly above her neighbor’s home. In 2013, another witness saw a strange cylindrical object moving overhead at high speed.

DALLAS-FORT WORTH, TX. In 1947, a woman saw a UFO with occupants who stopped their craft to wave at her. In 1958, a young girl said a gray-type ET stared at her from her bedroom window. In 1972, a family in Dallas saw a 30-foot-wide UFO being chased by jets. In 1974, Dallas-Fort Worth Airport experienced a wave of sightings. More cases, including an onboard experience, an apparent dog-man, and possible ETs walking among us!

ASHEVILLE, NC. In 1947, a sighting over a park in Asheville kicked off the modern age of UFOs. Dramatic sightings continued in 1957, 1974, 1977, 1987 and 1989. These are not just anomalous lights, but solid craft seen by multiple witnesses. In 2013, Reverend Michael Carter was visited by a human-looking ET who cured him of a severe blood-clot in his leg. So many cases!

SKAGWAY/JUNEAU, AK. Way back in 1916, numerous people saw a UFO from the decks of the Steamer, Georgia. In 1969, two other sailors found their boat, The Teel, disabled by a low flying craft. A sighting in 1973 impressed several witnesses, and in 1980 the small town of Kate experienced a dramatic UFO display. In 1996, a Skagway woman had a closeup brush with a UFO that resulted in missing time.

BRADENTON, FL. Several military personnel experienced dramatic close-up encounters in 1949 and 1955. Very unusual sightings were reported in 1957 and 1959. In 1971, a police officer reported a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid asking about the wars on our planet. More cases in 2002, 2003 and 2006 make is clear that Bradenton is of interest to the ETs.

These ten locations, provide by you the viewers, show once again that UFOs are ubiquitous, and that ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity campaign to announce their presence. With so many cases and so much evidence, the time for skepticism is over. The truth can no longer be hidden, distorted, ignored, or denied. UFOs are real and we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the 
Paranormal I'm
going to continue my ongoing series UFOs in your hometown this episode is called
UFOs in your hometown episode 6 I am doing this for you guys I put out a
challenge quite some time ago name any Town any City any place on this planet
and I can find a history of UFO encounters there and I'm still bad in 100% I've got a list now of about 600
locations so please have mercy on me if you're going to provide any more locations it's going to take me some
time to get there but I've got 10 locations that you guys provided I'm going down the list in order and I found
Encounters in all of them and not only encounters but the full range of them sightings Landings humanoids onboard
experiences Clos Encounters of the first second and third Fourth Kind these cases
are supported by pretty much the full variety of evidence we have out there so
there are photographic cases some really interesting ones radar returns certainly
Landing traces electromagnetic disturbances animal reactions and
physiological effects quite a bit of humanoid encounters I find those the most
interesting so don't worry about that there are some there now the locations I
am covering today include Benson Arizona also Greensboro North Carolina
Edwardsburg Michigan bedfordshire in the UK also chiku timi Canada this is in
Quebec Dallas Fort Worth Texas Asheville North
Carolina both Juno and Skagway in Alaska and finally Bradenton Florida so thanks
to all of you who provided these locations I always have fun exploring these new places on our planet and
finding new cases this is going to be a long episode let's get started and the
first location I will be exploring today is Benson Arizona this is by special
request of Cliff Olinger didn't find as many as I hoped but I found a few and
they're definitely interesting one of the first major cases in Benson Arizona
occurred on April 3rd 1952 and the main witness is Chick Logan
he's a good witness a civilian flight Commander he was on the runway at Morana
Airbase he was waiting for a radio transmission from one of his students and this is when he noticed a strange
oval light in the sky now he didn't pay too much attention to it at first but then several other people there also
noticed it and they pointed out that it wasn't moving so chick Logan decided he
was going to take off and intercept it which he did and he climbed up to an
altitude of about 14,000 ft he was not equipped to go any higher and this
object was much higher he estimates it was about 40,000 ft altitude chick Logan
described it as about five times the size of a b29 super Fortress so pretty
big and as he says it was not like a disc but more oblong it was real bright and
shown like polished aluminum I'll tell you I have been flying for 25 years and
I've have never seen anything like it so this object remained over the base for nearly an hour before disappearing there
was a possibility that this was a weather balloon though it certainly didn't look like it and further research
revealed that no there were no weather balloon launches that might have caused this sighting
and here's another one four years later September 26 1956 members of the ground Observer
Corps whose job it is to identify aircraft actually saw a fleet of glowing
objects move over Tucson heading towards Benson and sure enough people in Benson
saw it as well because the Benson Arizona newspaper called the center to report that a group of 12 objects in a
quote diamond shaped formation had just gone over their Town moving
faster than any jet so again definitely unidentified here's a real recent one on
the evening of May 13 2022 a man from Benson captured a
strange light in the sky on his trail cam which he set up near his home here's
the weird thing only two frames show this object so whatever it was it came
and went pretty quickly so there you go click sorry I couldn't find more but in
all honesty that's a pretty small town and the cases I did find are pretty well verified and there's a photographic case
so I find that pretty interesting let's move to the Le next location this is by
special request of pogo Joe so this is for you Pogo Joe I am exploring
Greensboro North Carolina and I have to tell you Greensboro delivered Big Time
sightings Landings humanoids onboard encounters Landing traces photos the
whole deal so I had a really good time exploring Greensboro the first
Greensboro case that I could find comes from researcher George D faucet a highly
respected researcher and he was given this account by Two Sisters Dr Katherine I Rankin and
her sister a school teacher Mary Francis Rankin now they were not the Witnesses
in fact the Witnesses were their parents who told them this story this incident
occurred one day in May 1930 during broad daylight when Mr and Miss Ranken
saw a UFO land in the backyard of their home on Pearson Street they said this
object was moving both horizontally and vertically in the sky and then it landed
now they could see that it was shaped like a top dark in color pretty big about 40 ft wide and there was
definitely something inside of it because looking at it they were startled to see through a window The Head and
Shoulders of an occupant he wore a tight fitting garment dark in color a tight
fitting helmet over his head and they watched him and this object for a good 5 to 10 minutes when without warning this
object Rose vertically in perfect silence and moved off into the distance
so it was much later that Mr and Mrs Ranken shared this sighting with their two daughters and it was they who shared
it with researcher George faet and here's another July 7 1947 this is
around the exact same time as the famous Roswell crash in New Mexico was at 6:30
a.m. and Albert rigs a soldier was driving near the
Greensboro highp Point airport along with another soldier who he had picked up a hitchhiker and together they saw
three gray black discs moving overhead these were moving in a triangular
formation pretty low in the sky 200 to 300 ft high and they were swerving from
side to side in this weird motion they both heard this quote zipping noise and
these objects Whizz by them at an estimated 500 mph and disappeared off
into the distance here's another one about 5 years later 8:45 a.m. another
daylight sighting September 22nd 1952 Dr Franklin mcnut who is the dean
of University of North Carolina he and his wife were in the yard of their home
on the Connell Road this is just east of downtown
Greenboro and they saw a plane passing overhead heading for the airport and
this is when Frank L's wife said do you see something ahead of the plane and
looking up Franklin did a silver-colored object which was motionless for a moment
and then darted off at very high speed so after it disappeared he went inside and called the weather bureau who said
that they didn't know what it was there were no weather balloons so he called the airport who verified the plane he
had come he had seen coming in for a landing but they said that the pilot made no report of any
UFO but then and this is interesting the tower official added kind of
enigmatically Pilots have stopped reporting flying saucers because they don't want to be laughed at so the
implication was that this pilot could very well have seen something but didn't want to talk about it 3 years later
another wave of sightings on April 21st 1955 Greensboro police and the weather
bureaus were swamped with calls by people reporting a flash of intense blue
light followed a few minutes later by a thunderous explosion this was at 2 a.m.
it woke up many people in Greensboro there they never did find out what it was there was speculation that
it might have been a meteor but this was never confirmed now here is a really fascinating case you might not realize
it but the most popular day for UFOs is actually July 4th Independence Day
and you might think oh this is just fireworks not necessarily I did a whole episode on Fourth of July sightings this
is a thing and it happened in Greensboro on July 4
1963 one adult and a group of boys were watching a fireworks show and this is
when a strange craft showed up the adult reported it anonymously to the Air Force
and I'll just quote him directly as he says I noticed the UFO to the north I
observed it for two minutes as it moved silently Eastward then suddenly reversed the direction as it picked up speed then
assuming its original course once again it moved slowly upwards and out of sight
was very large and was yellow or orange with a row of red lights at its
perimeter I don't claim that the UFO was extraterrestrial but its size and
pattern of light would suggest it was not a conventional craft one evening in
late September 1966 numerous people including police officers reported very
fast moving starc objects now these were changing in color from Blue to red and
white and back again they were seen not only over Greensboro but over Winston Salem Ashboro ramser and other areas now
Marine officials when contacted suggested that these might be flares
but Witnesses were able to locate another military officer who did not want his name used and he said that no
it was very unlikely these were flares these settings were too far inland flares were not being dropped there at
that time now here's a case of direct contact this one occurred in September
of 1966 to a gentleman by the name of David Oldham he lived in Greensboro he was 16
years old when he and two friends were driving near Guilford courthouse National military Park on their way to a
local nightclub and this is when they came upon a huge light quote sitting
right on the trees it was very low and as they watched it it kind of swung back and forth in this weird pendulum likee
movement now this is when David felt a strange near paralysis grip him almost
like he was frozen and the next thing he knew they knew all three were arriving
at the club but mysteriously two hours had elapsed without any idea of where
the time went so yeah a clear-cut case of missing time associated with a very
close-up encounter huge red flag here now it took years for David Oldham to
connect this with a possible UFO
encounter and having had other experiences he finally decided to
contact Bud Hopkins the famous researcher and Bud Hopkins arranged for
him to undergo hypnotic regression and under hypnosis David Oldham recalled an onboard
encounter he recalls seeing this object in the sky and suddenly gray type ETS
short little figures with large heads and dark eyes were approaching the car
David got out of the back seat he doesn't doesn't recall exactly how he got on board this craft he suddenly
found himself inside it inside a small cylindrical room it was well lit but
there was no lamps or lights that he could see he was put on a table as several Grays surrounded him and as he
says they all had large heads and they had these tremendously big eyes I mean
it reminded you of a cat eye so these beings examined him passing an
instrument with lights over his body he was then physically levitated he said
to another room he didn't walk they kind of floated him around they took him to this other room and showed him a box
with weird hieroglyphic like symbols on it and it seemed to be very important because the Grays told him one of them
told him telepathically remember this they then
left him alone for a short time in this room daav is looking around and he saw this other slightly larger box
and he felt something telling him not to touch it but he did anyway and he regretted it because it physically
shocked him as David says it was like it I was shocked out of my skin like
touching a live wire so at this point the ETS escorted him from the craft and
David began crying and this is when one of the ETS turned to him and said why
are you crying why are you showing this emotion and David replied
because I've never felt love like this before he elaborated to Bud Hopkins and
said it was like at one point we connected in unconditional love so this
was ultimately a very positive encounter he was returned to the car where his two friends sat in a non-responsive trance
completely unaware of David's absence so this was one of many encounters he had and in fact
later David's story was featured in Bud Hopkins book missing time he did find
strange Landing traces in his yard at one point a mysteriously crushed tree a
13t wide circular depression but it was this experience at age 16 that really
impacted him the most as he says all I know is something happened to me I don't
totally understand it I probably never will I'm sure one day I'll come at peace
with it and until I do I'm going to keep searching so the Encounters in
Greensboro continue was on the night of November 2nd 1973 that residence near the
intersection of Lee Street and Silver Avenue which you can see here called the
police because there was this egg-shaped object hovering only about 15 ft they
estimate above their home it was changing colors it was circling around
and was staying there for quite some time the police arrived just in time to see this object as it moved off and was
just 2 weeks later 6:30 p.m. November 14 that at least nine additional Witnesses
observed a UFO again in Greensboro one of them was Sharon
McIntyre she was with her husband and they were alerted to something unusual when their dog became upset so looking
outside to see why this is when they saw a glowing object hovering was darting
back and forth up and down and did so for a full 15 minutes long enough for
them to alert their neighbors the miners who also saw it in fact they all got in
their cars and chased this object down the street their other neighbors the Andrews also saw this object they all
described it as about 25 to 40 ft wide maybe 5 to 8 ft high was changing color
and unknown to all of them there was in fact another witness Mr Harold Hopper
who you can see here he also saw this object so this is a really well verified
multi- witness case and the cases continue here's another one June 16
1973 three Witnesses in Greenboro saw a disc-shaped object dropped down to a low
elevation it hovered for 8 minutes and actually landed briefly on the ground
immediately ascended upwards DED around and moved off so going to where this
object had landed depressions were found in the grass apparently where this
object had touched down more cases January 12 1986 Scott and Tina K reported their
sighting of no less than 10 glowing disc-shaped objects flying in this weird
shifting formation directly over Greensboro and then on March 4
1992 a meteorologist by the name of Corey leof observed a red orange object moving
slowly and silently and seeming to stop in place at one point and he did some
research and found out that another airport guard saw it as well some years
later on the night of May 29 1994 an insurance company vice president
he wants to remain anonymous said he saw a red light moving horizontally stopping
and then darting away at metotic speed he and at least two others watched it
sometimes through binoculars still were not able to identify it and finally it moved off was just a few months later on
November 26 1994 another Greensboro resident used
binoculars to observe what he described as a cylindrical object with a green FL
flashing light in the middle he watched it for 30 minutes it's a long time one
point it seemed to split into two he couldn't tell for sure because at this point it was obscured by clouds and he
lost sight of it moving along January 24 2004 a Greensboro couple watched a
single glowing object which they said came straight down vertically out of the sky moved closer to them then moved
straight up and blinked out yes a brief sighting but certainly unusual here's another much more recent
case February 7 2014 a man was driving by the Greensboro airport and saw a plane taking off and
this is when he noticed a dis shaped craft not too far from the Jet and as he
watched this object sped back and forth at a very high rate of speed and then
disappeared now I wanted to just briefly mention three additional cases in Greensboro cuz these all involve
photographs one gentleman was photographing the moon this was on February 3rd 2015 now he didn't see
anything unusual while taking these photographs but looking at the digital photos he did notice two strange objects
you can see them here you can make up your own minds about it uh 4 years later
January 25 2019 a man was outside looking at the birds and this is when he
noticed a strange light in the sky guy he quickly grabbed his camera and photographed this strange cylindrical
object you can see here now the most recent case occurred on October 20th
2022 when a weird glowing cloudlike object was seen moving around and
hovering at low altitude above a shopping mall and you can see from these two photographs that it is moving around
and yet still maintaining its shape it's certainly unusual okay Pogo Joo I hope you found
that interesting thanks very much I had a lot of fun exploring Greensboro lots
of cases there loved the photographic cases I'm really surprised that there are still any Skeptics whatsoever on
this planet I mean seriously if you can find a history of encounter pretty much
everywhere what does that say this is far far more common than most people realize especially when you consider the
fact that most people don't even report their encounters which is especially true if it's a major one involving
humanoids or an onboard encounter or something that's got high strangeness to it so let's move to the next location
which is by special request of Phillip philli this is for you I am exploring
Edwardsburg Michigan and this one was a toughy I didn't find a whole lot again a
pretty small town so I did find some still bat in a
th% as I said Edwardsburg is a pretty small town like less than 2,000 people
so I'm amazed I found any cases but I did and they're quite strange most of
them occurred in 2008 the first was on May 22nd
2008 and it was about 3:30 p.m when a man was driving along State Highway 12
near the brush Road onramp when he saw a triangular-shaped object Zoom right over
his car says it was less than 50 ft overhead he in fact pulled over to watch
it and as he says and I quote I sat in complete astonishment that this was
actually happening as the object glided toward the ground at my car it traveled
the distance from Horizon to above my car so fast I didn't even have time to
Blink I watched as this now quite visible equilateral triangle with a
semicircle cut out in the back blew in a matter of 10 to 15 feet above my car the
object must have been about twice as long and twice as wide as my car and emitted no sound but it had three lights
on the bottom one in each corner of the triangle the lights seemed to be streaming down like strobe lights until
it banked onto its side when it did this I got a clear view of the bottom and
noticed that the lights were about the size of a dinner plate so he wasn't the only one who was watching this he saw
two other cars pull pull over and it was less than 1 month later on June 10 2008
when a witness was near Eagle Lake which you can see here he described seeing a
metallic looking kind of balloon-shaped object the thing was was glowing red
underneath there were two of them one was moving very quickly and the other seemed to change shape kind of
transforming to a triangular shaped object and it quickly dropped from the
sky and that was the last he saw both of these objects it was only one day later
this time at 11:30 p.m. on June 11 2008 that a witness reported a very large
cigar-shaped object glowing bright orange hovering just above the Treetops
for about 5 minutes and then disappearing he says this was the third
time he had seen it and then on a prior occasion it disappeared just as another
plane approached lots of cases of that UFO's dark starting off when another aircraft comes near and here's a final
case quite odd this occurred on December 1st 2022 when a witness saw what he thought
was a meteor sort of a light blue Fireball with a long white tail but
here's the thing as it headed down almost coming in for a landing it suddenly made quote an extreme right
turn and then it took off at quote extremely high speed so clearly not a
shooting star as they don't make right turns not like that there you go Phillip
that's Edwardsburg Michigan for you no I couldn't find any humanoid cases or onboard cases just sightings but still I
think this proves that UFOs have visited
Edwardsburg now let's move to the next location this is by special request of
Ginger and this location is bedfordshire England and wow Ginger I have to thank
you for pointing out this Loc because this one absolutely delivered many amazing cases sightings face to- face
contact with humanoids and more and some really unusual cases in fact there was
one so unusual I had to save it for a separate episode I wanted to do a little bit of a deeper dive into it so stay
tuned there will will be more cases coming from bedfordshire but here's the
ones I found the earliest case I could find in bedfordshire is quite strange
this is direct contact and boy this is a weird one it occurred in November of
1956 when John witw worth who owned a business at 26 High Street in shefford
bedfordshire you can see it here reports that a strange looking gentleman human
looking but with a very large High forehead he entered his shop and really
surprised John by purchasing a handkerchief with exact change this was
odd because this article was not displayed nor was the price displayed this was weird but even more odd was
what happened next because this customer told John that if he wanted to see a flying saucer he should go to a certain
bridge near bigles Wade on November 28th 1956 so this intrigued John he followed
the instructions went to this location and was amazed to see a top-shaped object with glowing Port holes
fly overhead stop hover and dart off now
the story is not over yet because it was one year later that this same strange customer visited John again in his shop
and told him this time to go to a spot near the big water tower on Topper's Hill and that he would have direct
contact with the ETS this was on November 27 1957 at 8:00 p.m. the
customer said that they would appear over John's home on the night of contest act and sure enough on December 1st
1957 a UFO appeared over John's home now John alerted A lot of people he went
with a convoy of cars including a news van to this spot but to his
disappointment nothing showed up so everyone dispersed he returned
home and this is when he received a very strange phone call a voice a male voice
said quote you were very foolish tonight and it began to reprimand him for
bringing other people along to the meeting place so John listened to this with quite some astonishment he handed
the phone to someone else The Voice wouldn't speak and said only the message was for John witor
alone so such a shame could have been direct contact there but it was aborted
here's another really interesting case 7:30 p.m. on December 14
1957 a gentleman by the name of John Jordan who owned an electric Mill
noticed this round white light shining beams of light down onto his electric
Mill it hovered in place then darted away at an estimated 100 milph hovered
again and moved off this was interesting because only one week earlier John was
flying in a plane over his home in bedfordshire and he saw a very similar
if not ident itical looking object now according to the editors of the Flying Saucer review where this
account was published other sightings had occurred recently in this area and they continued because it was
one day in July of 1962 this time at the Luton area of
bedfordshire Two Sisters aged seven and three and A2 were playing in their
backyard and this is when they saw a cigar-shaped object hovering and descending to very low altitude this
frightened them this was not a normal looking craft so they ran inside their home and watched from the kitchen window
and looking at this object were amazed to see two human-looking men with very
pale skin straight blonde hair they were wearing silver blue outfits and the
occupants of this craft stared briefly at the witnesses and after this the object
quickly Rose upwards and was gone here's another case 2 years later 10:30 p.m.
November 5 1964 Taxi Driver John Hodges was driving
in bedfordshire when he saw a brilliant star-like object with beams of light
radiating from it it was star-like but much too big to be a star and it
remained hovering in place for more than an hour and at one point and this gave
it away it started making this weird strange pendulum like movement so clearly not a star John was not the only
witness he brought two other people who also watched it they observed it for a full hour and 15 minutes when it
suddenly glided away and disappeared over the horizon so just another UFO
hanging out all right here is another case it was late one evening in April 1971 when
pilot and flight instructor Les Seymour had a very interesting UF phone counter
near Toho again in bedfordshire he saw this brilliant green blue object which
he said was five times brighter than a star and it looked like it was about
20,000 ft altitude so quite high up there but it flew in from the southeast
it stopped and hovered it winked out flared up moved overhead then it zipped
off at a fantastic speed he said it made no sound whatsoever was in view for a
full 20 seconds here's the thing Les is very familiar with aircraft he's a
trained Observer he estimates that this object was about 40 to 50 ft in diameter
pretty large and as it moved off so quickly he estimated its speed at about
25,000 milph clearly clearly not one of our own now here's another case same
year this occurred on the night of November 9 1971 Barry kugan reported his sighting of an
object over the goldington school he says and I quote I thought it
was an aircraft at first but it stopped overhead for a few seconds and then it went really bright after that it shot
off and I didn't see it again so a lot of UFOs hovering over schools I did a
whole episode on that so that looks like another schoolyard encounter though there's only a single
witness now here here is another somewhat harrowing case this occurred
one cold night in November 1980 when a mother and her teenage daughter were feeding their horses in the field by
their Farm in Rural bedfordshire and this is when they noticed a bright round light that was moving slowly and quickly
across the ground almost at ground level in the neighbors's field in fact it seemed to be exploring the field by the
way it was moving the Witnesses were absolutely convinced it was unusual was moving very quickly and gliding now
suddenly it turned towards them and it lit the area around them like daylight
the horses were not reacting in any way the object was totally silent so they
watched this when without warning it winked out and then it reappeared much farther across the field continued to
scan the ground and then vanished and reappeared again so this frightened them
they ran inside and watched from inside as this light continued this behavior for a full 2 hours until finally
disappearing for good they did ask their neighbor about it the next day he said
he hadn't seen anything he did check his field but found nothing unusual next
case August 17 1987 a lady by the name of gay Pard was
driving with her sister to the Luton Airport in bedfordshire when they both saw a circular object with a kind of
v-shaped side to it three blinking lights nights they could not identify it
and neither as it turned out could the police who they called and the police
had no information but as gay says I always scoffed at the idea of flying
saucers but I couldn't make sense of what we saw at first I thought it was a low airplane then a balloon but both me
and my sister are convinced that it couldn't have been either of these here's another briefcase October
1988 a woman living on Beach Avenue in bigles Wade said that she saw a strange
object hovering overhead this is just a tiny little Street you can see it here but as she says quote was shaped like a
balloon but moved too fast to be one it was silver and Shining with red and
bright yellow orange lights now here is a very weird case somewhat concerning it
occurred to a family of five while driving through bedfordshire on August 8th 1992
the kids were in the back seat singing Beetles songs the father Mr be we don't
know their names they're Anonymous he noticed this thick wall of mist ahead of them on the road and he had no choice
but to drive into it and when he did something very strange happened all
sound stopped the kids were no longer singing they couldn't hear the car engine nothing they popped out
immediately on the other side and right into a huge downpour of rain rain so it
went from good weather to just pouring rain which was very odd and all of them
were severely disoriented in fact Mr B felt like he might have lost control of the car for a
moment he wondered if he had had an accident uh they found themselves 8
miles further down the road took them a second to orient themselves to that there was no traffic at this point all
the traffic was mysteriously absent so they stopped to get gas and this is when
they realized they were missing about 20 minutes of time so both Mr and Mrs be
were still very disoriented kind of dissociated Miss B felt so strange that
she actually wondered if perhaps they had been killed in a car accident and were now dead wandering
ghosts but she surprised herself by suddenly blurting out for no reason she
could fathom I think it's happened we've been in a flying saucer it was later that night that Mr B
did notice a small mark on his abdomen and a small mark on the back of his wife's head for the next few days the
whole family was strangely tired they felt that time was kind of distorted
they all experienced a loss of appetite it turns out Mrs B does have a history
of UFO encounters and strange events including seeing humanoids in her
bedroom so this does sound like a missing time encounter now one final
case in bedfordshire a gentleman by the name of Peter Bowen began seeing UFOs
near his home uh he saw several of them but the most dramatic one involved the sighting
of a disk-shaped object which he said was surrounded by this sort of black
ball of smoke or Mist said this object was hovering 300 ft overhead in the
field directly behind the lon airport he actually called the airport and they
told him that they knew nothing about it that had not been tracked on radar but
turns out Peter learned from a confidential source that this was a lie that airport officials had in fact not
only tracked this object on radar but had been tracking strange targets for the past week and as Peter says these
things are real and they do exist I have had quite a few sightings there you go
Ginger I hope that didn't disappoint bedfordshire UK is definitely been visited and like I said in the beginning
I have another report there that I'm going to take a look at in a future episode because it is just off the
charts strange so we have that to look forward
to okay what do we have next we are looking at chiku timi in Quebec Canada
this is by special request of Mike going all over the world here Canada has
definitely got its share of encounters chiku timi I didn't find a whole lot but
I found some and I certainly think you will find them compelling the first case
I found in chiku timi involved a humanoid was about 8:00 p.m. one evening
in April 1968 as a lady by the name of Miss Trembley left her chiku timi home to go
visit a restaurant and as she left her home she dropped her bag and looked up
saw a UFO this object she said was only 300 ft above her very low was sending
down a beam of light it appeared to be scanning the area that was her impression then suddenly this beam of
Light Came Down directly on her it was very bright it caused her to close her eyes opening them moments later she
looked up this UFO was now gone so she returned inside her home and just a few
minutes later she saw something White Moving outside home and turning to look at it she saw this small humanlike being
only 6 feet away from her she said that he appeared to be about 50 to 55 years
old but she was mostly struck by his dark blue eyes which had this expression
of sadness this being was wearing a seamless white overall no zippers no
buttons but before she could alert anyone else in the house this being vanished and that was the end of the
sighting another very interesting case comes from a Miss William de it was
around 1:00 a.m. on July 12 1970 that she was in her home located on
61 Rue Vincent which you can see here and I'll just quote the witness directly
as she says I never believed in these stories before I saw this machine just
45 ft above the neighboring house it seemed to move towards me it had four
arms in the form of a cross and they were luminous in the center was a rather
strong telescopic light it approached me then departed calmly without making any
noise and I am not one of these young people who dream in color I can assure you I was not even in bed yet one other
case very brief occurred on October 14th 2013 and was reported to the National
UFO Reporting Center the witness said that he saw a very large cylindrical-shaped object he said it was
30 to 40 ft long and was flying quote really fast said it was only about 100
to 200 ft overhead and off it went so there's no other information about this
case but certainly intriguing all right there you go Mike chiku timi does have
encounters and yeah it's only three but in my defense one was a humanoid
encounter and I find the humanoid cases most interesting of all those in the
onboard cases of course so many cases and I have to tell you yeah I found only
three but you can bet there's closer to 300 I've said it before it Bears
repeating most people don't report their encounters I wish they would this subject would be far more accepted and
mainstream if people Found the courage to report their encounters certainly not blaming them we're all victims of the
UFO coverup thankfully that is beginning to end we are seeing all these
Congressional hearings recently it's pretty interesting times are changing now let's move to our next location and
that is Dallas Fort Worth in Texas this is by special request of crypto moito so
this is for you crypto mojito lots of really good cases I think you'll find them pretty interesting we will see the
earliest case I could find in the Dallas Fort Worth area occurred in
1947 there's not a lot of information on this but it is an occupant sighting a humanoid sighting a woman was driving on
the outskirts of Fort Worth when she says she saw a 25 foot wide disc shaped
craft moving overhead it impressed her enough to stop her car so she jumps out
and waves at this craft now to her surprise this craft tilted towards her
and she could see occupants in inside and these occupants actually waved right back at her then the craft flew away in
perfect silence now here's another very brief but a humanoid case which comes from qos investigator Larry sessions not
a whole lot of information other than one summer evening in Dallas a 12-year-old girl with the initials J D
looked out the window of her home and saw a small humanoid being she says
about the size of a 10-year-old old boy she said he had large quote friendly
eyes and he was wearing a skintight silver uniform now this little girl
stared at this being for a full five minutes which is a long time before it
finally just walked away and moved out of sight and that was that next case
9:50 p.m. on August 24 1972 four teenagers noticed a silver
disc-shaped object with a dome on top very near the Dallas Fort Worth airport
so they did the right thing they ran inside and got more witnesses their parents Mr and Mrs S Lane who came
outside and they all saw it they estimate this object was 30 ft wide with
red and white lights and a row of Port holes around this Dome the six Witnesses watched the object for a full seven
minutes until a group of four military jets approached at which point the UFO
moved in a Wide Circle and climbed C silently upwards and was gone now Mrs
Lane called the airport who said it was probably a balloon but get this Carswell
Air Force Base said that they had actually received a report of a UFO from the Mexico tracking station and had sent
the Jets to investigate it now 1974 brought a huge wave of sightings over
the Dallas Fort Worth area on the morning of February 8th 1974 for airport employees spotted five
objects right over the airport one technician said and I quote they were
bigger and brighter than large Stars they were not any aircraft I know they
were clearly visible and appeared in on line as five flat flying saucers now a
tower supervisor said that their employees may have been observing quote dust particles which of course the
witnesses totally rejected talk about debunking a sighting but the sightings
continued and soon citizens living outside the airport began to report strange lights one of them was medical
technician Sandra hodin who told reporters that she had seen many strange
objects which seemed to be checking up the airport as she says after citing the
lights which seemed to travel and hover at just above Treetop level on several nights a reported the UFOs to the FAA
control tower at Dallas Fort Worth Airport Sandra and others watched one of these objects send down search lights
and apparently land in a field in fact reporters heard about this went to the area and found a 20ft wide circle of
crushed vegetation swirled into a clockwise pattern and throughout the
next few months these sightings continued all kinds of people were reporting these objects almost always
describing them is hovering at Treetop level right near the airport sometimes Landing next to the western boundary of
the airport some of these Witnesses began using flashlights to blanket these
objects which would reportedly blink back in response so this is kind of like
C5 work here's another very unusual onboard case which comes from author and
researcher Cynthia L Turnage one evening in February 1982 Alvin Guera of Fort Worth was drawn
outside by a flash of blue light and he saw this grayish stealth-like craft
hovering he says about 75 ft over his house and he heard a female voice say
Don't Be Afraid cooperate we won't hurt you immediately a beautiful tall woman
with pale skin and blonde hair appeared next to him according to Alvin she was wearing a light blue jumpsuit she
immediately approached him and said again don't be afraid so as she is standing standing
next to him a Mist formed around her and Alvin and Alvin suddenly found
himself presumably inside this craft he said It felt quite chilly inside he
noticed several containers about the size of a human body which the female ET
told him were for Rejuvenation he was taken to the control room where he saw
more of these uh human figures all women
they brought him to a medical area where he said he saw several small animals
being examined and Alvin himself was instructed to lie on a table where he was examined they placed an instrument
over his body which allowed him to see a holographic image of his body and later
during this on board encounter he said he had relations with one of the ETS on
board next thing he knows he's waking back up in his bed his clothes are missing as is his turquoise necklace
that he had been wearing at the start of this encounter but it was now gone now here is a very unusual encounter which
might or might not be UFO related but it's certainly
cryptozoological it occurred late one evening in 2004 when a young couple was driving through a South Dallas suburb
when they saw what they described as a Dogman or a werewolflike humanoid creature crossing the road right in
front of them and it was huge they said it was seven feet tall by peel but
looked like a dog had gray black hair bright yellow eyes and was so big that
it crossed the road in just a few steps it was running and it moved off into a
field it did not seem to notice or care that it was being observed now there are
many other cases of sightings but here is another humanoid one around noon on
September 5 2015 two people were walking along KD Trail in Dallas a popular walking area
when they noticed two very unusual people who they wonder if they were even
human because they were walking with a very unusual gate according to the witnesses it looked like these two
people were wearing costumes and wigs and were looking around them uncomfortably as if they were trying to
blend in happened to be a very hot day and the clothing that these two figures
were wearing was inappropri for the weather covered their entire bodies uh so the Witnesses were pretty much
convinced that these were not normal people and did report this encounter to muon there you go crypto monito Dallas
Fort Worth I think there's quite a few more well I know there are quite a few more
cases I skip over the ones that are just very brief reports of anomalous lights
which don't have a whole lot of information to provide and are frankly just not as interesting as the more
detailed reports of solid craft or objects moving in ways that are clearly anomalous and certainly the humanoid
reports so please don't consider this comprehensive by any means in fact I
expect if I were to dive deep visit these locations spend a year researching
I could write an entire book on every single one of these locations not
kidding okay let's move to the next one this was really interesting so thank you
William this is for you and this is Asheville North Carolina and wow I found
some cases all right and these were really interesting and include pretty
much the full range of UFO cases I didn't find as many cases I had hoped to
find in Asheville but I found some and that some are absolutely really
interesting here's an intriguing case which occurred in 1947 the start of the
Modern Age of euphology a woman her son and two neighbors were driving near
Asheville's recreation park when they saw something quote bright as the
evening star but much much lower than planes normally fly and round just as
they say like a saucer so yeah a brief case but
certainly sounds unusual here's another 10 years later November 6th
1957 a pretty big wave of sightings hit Asheville and it apparently became so
intense that one police officer radioed his Superior Captain Everett G Nicholson
and asked if civil defense units had any anti-aircraft guns presumably to be used
against the the huge number of UFOs being seen in this area now moving along
here's a very interesting case 4:00 a.m. September 22nd 19 74 a night Watchman by
the name of Tony weatherman called the police when he saw a large glowing object hovering overhead for a full 15
minutes and when he called the police it turned out they were receiving several other calls from residents in the area
so patrolman William Cummings came to the area where Tony
weatherman was and he saw this object himself now he refused to comment on whether this was an actual UFO
but he did say something interesting that the Asheville Airport had actually captured this object on
radar but true to form and in line with the cover up the FAA later said that the
returns were caused by a simple temperature inversion which seems
unlikely given that so many people were reporting this sighting now 3 years
later 900 p.m. June 15 1977 a couple was driving through Asheville when they
observed a disc-shaped object they said it was big as big as a house it had rows
of brightly lit Windows colored lights on the bottom and hovered in complete silence at very low altitude just above
the Treetops for about 10 minutes it impressed them enough to report it to
the National UFO Reporting Center another case 1987 Steven Bond and Susan
light cap said that they were driving south of Asheville on US Highway
64 when they stopped because they saw this very unusual looking thing in the
sky which they described as a large fuzzy looking yellow light was hovering
at an estimated altitude of 1,000 ft it made no sound and that's when it
suddenly vanished leaving them convinced it was a genuine UFO so Larry faucet who lived in this
area interviewed many witnesses and he said that in the next year 1988 he
documented get this at least 829 Encounters in North Carolina alone
now these are just the reported ones again this is much more common than people
realize here's another case 5:30 p.m. October 24
1999 a gentleman emplo employed as an executive recruiter he and his wife saw a brilliant orange
light hovering overhead in Asheville it disappeared behind the trees but it was
just a couple of weeks later on November 12th that they had another sighting this time of a silver disc darting around in
the sky now here's a very interesting case of direct contact and apparently a
healing I interviewed this gentleman directly firsthand his name is Michael J
and he had his first encounter with ETS on December 28th 1989 at age 34 while
living with his girlfriend in a Manhattan apartment he woke up and saw a typical gray alien chalk white skin
pear-shaped head a tight fitting silver jumpsuit wraparound eyes a spindly
looking body and these encounters continued to the point that he actually sought regressive hypnosis with Dr Jean
m and did recall being taken on board a ship going into a round room with no
corners indirect lighting all the things that we hear about he said it was like being in a doctor's office almost when
you go for an exam that's a direct quote but the setting I want to talk about
here occurred in 2013 when Reverend Michael Carter was living in
Asheville at this time his right leg became very painful and swollen and over
a period of 3 days this conditioned worsened quickly so he went to the hospital and got a tragic
diagnosis doctor told him he had a severe blood clot in his leg in his
right leg said it was lifethreatening he should have gone to the doctor much earlier so the doctor prescribed a
monthlong treatment using blood thinning medication and ordered Michael to return weekly for
close observation at this point Michael's leg was swollen to twice its normal
size now it was on the evening of July 4 2013 Michael was laying in bed unable to
sleep when suddenly a human looking figure appeared at the foot of his bed
and as Michael says he was very big and muscular he wore one of those cowls that
monks wore back in Renaissance times he had long blonde hair shoulder length he
was pale I was just stunned and he put out his hand I think it was
his right and this blue light came out of his palm energy or whatever it was
and it hit me I saw it hit me I didn't feel anything but then he just
dissolved so this absolutely amazed Michael he said this figure was 7 feet
tall wore this gray robe glowed with a white Aura but the entire experience was
only seconds long he immediately grabbed his bedside journal and wrote down what
happened but it was the next morning that he got a huge surprise he was very
excited to tell his family what happened but as he says I put my leg down on the
floor to get out of bed and I looked and my legs were the same size the right was
the same size as the left and Not only was it the same size but the veins in my
leg looked like they had changed position like they had been rerooted or something that's the best way I can put
it so a few days later Michael returned to his doctor for a routine checkup the
doctor was utterly shocked and asked him how did this happen you were just here
now Michael declined to tell the doctor about the bedroom visitation and just said just be happy for me it was two
weeks later while meditating that Michael saw this same figure again and this time an additional figure a woman
both Figures were again very strong muscular looking with long blonde hair Michael feels that they were checking up
on him letting him know that they were around in fact he feels that his experiences have given him a strong
boost in his own intuitive and healing abilities and really accelerated his
spiritual growth he's now the author of several books about UFOs and religion
he's a speaker A Healer a human rights activist and in fact he was recognized
by President Clinton for his efforts in community outreach and anti-racism there you go William
Asheville North Carolina it's been visited no denying it and I love that
case involving a healing I think this shows a very positive side to UFO
contact that doesn't get the attention it deserves it's a big part of what happens when people have direct contact
with humanoids and are taken on board it's very encouraging so now now let's
move to another location I put these two together because they were provided to
me together by DS so this is for you DS and these
locations that I'm exploring now are Juno Alaska and Skagway Alaska which are
adjoining neighboring locations so you could look at them as one location
they're separate but I included them together because they are very close together they were provided to me
together and very interesting stuff here some really unusual cases in this one
for sure again I was hoping to find more cases than I did in Skagway and Juno but
I found some really good ones like this one this is a very early sighting which occurred in
1916 this is significant because at that time there was no air traffic in the
Skagway Juno area none at all but on February 20th of that that year first
Officer Steve York and two deck hands on the steamer Georgia which you can see
here this is the ship we're heading from Juno to Skagway when at 2: a.m. strange
lights appeared blinking from white to Red to Green every few minutes for a
period of hours and in fact that same night 45 miles to the north at the
Walling gold mine in burner's Bay a Mr McGuire and other workers at the mine
saw a quote long black object passing from One Cloud to another high up in the
air they described it as looking a little bit like a zeppelin but it turns out there were more sightings later that
spring two other sightings were reported of a quote queer looking star which kept
moving up and down growing dimmer than flashing red and finally winking out so
clearly not a star now here is a really amazing case which began at 3:30 p.m.
daytime on December 15 1969 when Ken Marlo who owned the cargo
boat teal and his fellow sailor Ralph Kar saw a 2 foot wide sphere of white
light hovering just above the hawk Inlet now they didn't pay too much attention
to it at first kind of passed it off as a reflection from the ice or perhaps a
metallic boat but but then this object began to move towards them this is when
they realized it was unusual so G Ken grabbed a pair of binoculars and looking
through them still couldn't identify this object and it remained there for 4 hours eventually going lower and lower
and floating on the surface of the water only about a quar mile away then Rising
suddenly upwards and flying slowly over a nearby Ridge now the sighting wasn't
over yet because the next day December 16 at 6:00 p.m. Ken was docking at the
canery at Hawk Inlet when he saw it was apparently the same light but now it was
approaching from about a half mile away and it came right for them and soon it
was hovering just a few yards away and then it came directly over the Mast of
the boat only about 70 ft overhead it was hovering there in
perfect sight silence Ken started to radio the marine radio operator in Juno
when this object suddenly dipped in the air and it was at this point shortly later that the boat's power mysteriously
went out and the radio cut off now Ken tried to turn on the auxiliary battery
power but even that didn't work he finally just left the boat to go inside
a nearby building and he could now see that the light coming from this object was bright enough to not only illuminate
his entire boat but the area around them in fact the interior of the building he
was in was fully lit up by this object so he returned to his boat to turn off
the diesel power generator which was quote just barely running so this is unusual because it's
rare that a UFO affects a diesel engine but it did then after 15 minutes this
object moved off the generator immediately returned to normal but as it turned out the batteries on the boat
were now dead they had to be recharged the engine was checked over and nothing
wrong was found four years later late one evening in mid August 1973 a
gentleman by the name of Wayne Smallwood Jr and his friend were near Cedar Park
watching the moon through telescopes when they noticed quote a small glowing
object was close near the top of a telephone pole but they looked at through their telescope and they could
see it had green points on either side in fact as Wayne says it looked like a
bright boiled egg yolk with a needle stuck through it the points on each side were giving off a green glow which would
get brighter then duller they weren't the only ones who saw it there were three other Witnesses after 20 minutes
it finally left here's another really astonishing case which occurred in the small village of cake this is south of
Juno it's only got about 600 people who live in this town and it was mid January
1980 when resident Marvin kadake was the first to see this bright glowing object
moving up the Kiku straight to the South and as Marvin says was moving at a rapid
Pace a bright orange ball color it slowed down to a very slow pace and it
hovered over the town here the whole town just about came out to look at it
it looked like a flying saucer another Resident Janet Jackson said we
could see it pretty good there was flames on top it wasn't too far away so
this object stopped pretty much right over the town remained there for 10 minutes then began to move off fairly
quickly made a sharp 90° turn began blinking on and off and then darted off
at high speed again it was completely sent the whole town and no surprise
became the Talk of the Town for sometime now one final really dramatic case
occurred in November 1996 when Cindy who requested her last name be withheld left
Skagway and was driving to atlin and she was near the sixmile river came around a
corner and saw a gigantic UFO stunned by its appearance she
stopped the car the next thing she knows she's standing outside the car she did
not remember getting out of the car but at this point a voice telepathically
told her to follow This little light that was now hovering about 100 ft ahead
and 30 ft up right above the road so she got back in her car and did she followed
it and it guided her all the way to atlin now this is a trip which should
have taken about 3 hours but it took about 9 hours and she arrived at her
destination at 3:00 a.m. now she was going to a building which should have
been locked up uh but it wasn't uh in fact when she got to this building the
door was unlocked the lights were on the bed was made she thought that the people who lived there must have been expecting
her and prepared for her and this turned out to be a huge mystery because she
went she went to thank the owner the next day for being so courteous he was very puzzled and told
her that he didn't even know she was was coming that the building had actually been locked and the lights were off but
they weren't now turns out she has had prior encounters one year earlier while
living in Juno she saw strange lights hovering near Douglas Island and in fact
noticed them for several nights so this probably was a precursor to what is
quite obviously a much closer encounter so there you go Diaz Juno and and
Skagway do have a history of encounters reaching back more than a hundred years one involving missing time some very
high Strang encounters some obvious UFO displays so I think I did pretty good I
hope so so thank you for providing that location and yeah still after 40 years
I'm learning new stuff it's end endlessly fascinating subject so now
let's move to our last location in this episode epis for today and this location
actually was requested by two of you the location is Bradenton Florida it was
requested by Marina and John leant so thank you guys for providing this
location I found some crazy cases on this one in fact one was so amazing I
had to save it for a future episode sorry I wanted to include it but this
episode was already getting long already and I wanted to do again a deeper dive into it see if I could find more
information these episodes take a lot of research so please have mercy on me
again if you guys are going to provide another location for me to look up because yeah my list is like over
600 locations this takes a lot of work but let's just get started on Bradenton
and I think you'll be really impressed by what I found so Bradenton Florida is the last location we'll be exploring
tonight and it's certainly delivered some amazing accounts in fact one was
again was so weird I'm saving it for later the first one I could find occurred on January 27 1949 and I think
the only reason this one got any attention whatsoever is because the main witness eeran sanss was the acting chief
of the aircraft Branch at egund Air Force Base on that that evening eeran
and his wife were driving between Cortez and Bradenton on Cortez Road when
they saw what they described as a quote cucumber shaped object you can see his
drawing of it here he says they used binoculars and saw that this object was
quite large about the size of two train cars He estimates it had seven luminous
squarish Port holes it appeared to be emitting bright red Sparks out of one
and in in fact I saw it twice first at 10:20 p.m. traveling northwards at an
estimated 8,000 ft altitude descending and apparently Landing behind some trees
quite some distance away 8 miles or so but it was one hour later that they saw
it heading north this time making a turn to the West descending and then climbing
up with this weird bouncing motion would go thousands of feet up and then then swing down and then go up again
ultimately climbing up at about 500 mph up to 40,000 ft altitude where they lost
sight of it here's another case which caught the attention of Project Blue Book this occurred at 845 on January 6
1955 and the main witness is Keith breens he was a member of the 35th
tactical Hospital group at McDale Air Force Base in Florida and and was with
two other Airmen also members Don Roberts and Clyde Thorp they were
driving along US Highway 41 just 2 to three miles south of Bradenton and all three saw what they
described as a dark circular object but it was emitting intensely bright light
very intense was quite low about 1,000 ft High 1,500 ft west of the highway and
it so impressed them that they called the police and then called the Air Force here's another very interesting case two
years later late one night in 1957 when a gentleman by the name of
toots Maloney was walking near his home at First Street North this is at
Bradenton Beach when he noticed this strange light in the sky now he thought
briefly this might be a shooting star but then it did something totally unexpected and as tootes says in his own
words well sir sir the next thing I know this thing is dropping like an elevator
with a broken cable like swish I darn near swallowed my uppers it kind of
settled down about 50 ft off the water and just hung there with a kind of bluish light around the bottom it looked
like a cup without a handle set upside down on a saucer there was some yellow
light coming from the middle of it but I couldn't see nothing I had a feeling though that they could see me now
lamented that he was the only witness nobody else was around because as he says nobody believed me people look at
you like you got a few marbles missing when you talk about flying saucers I hope to goodness one of them lands smack
dab on the new bridge right in the middle of the celebration then maybe folks will wake up a bit so he's not the
only witness to be frustrated when he's trying to share his encounter here's another amazing case
which occurred on April 2 3rd 1959 just after midnight as a college student
Raymond nikud and His companion were driving home from a track meet in
Bradenton they were at the intersection of 29th Street and 9th Avenue looking to
the east when they saw it a UFO I'll just quote Raymond directly he describes
it vividly as he says we saw a brilliant red illumination just above the Horizon
the object was moving towards us we stopped the car and got out the light stopped within a mile or two from where
we were standing the taciturn object hovered above the Treetops for almost a
half minute when a beam of white light projected downward from the disc so yeah this object was totally
quiet and as they watched more beams came out and they got the distinct impression that this disc-shaped object
was searching for something on the ground after a few moments the beam suddenly shut off the disc rotated onto
its Edge it flashed through all the colors of the rainbow from red to blue white then It sped off to the south at
two to three times the speed of a jet or as Raymond says he estimates over 1,000
mph here's a very unusual case of direct contact with a humanoid being this
occurred at 500 p.m. one evening in November 1971 to a police officer by the
name of Gerald Myers he had just finished his shift and he stopped as he
often did after work near the Inland Waterway to relax and this is when he
heard a strange buzzing noise and locating the source he was amazed to see
this shimmering Vortex hovering just above the ground kind of like heat waves he said so he moved closer and was
shocked because he could now hear it in his head this weird noise and it was at
this point that a humanoid form emerged hovering about 2 feet off the ground
right where this sort of Heatwave Vortex was and it quickly became clear clear
enough that he could see arms and legs and a head he said that this humanoid form was dressed in a blue black costume
like a spacit complete with a helmet and a glass looking face plate and it was at
this point that a telepathic voice sounded in his head speaking in English
and it said why do humans have War so Gerald briefly considered this question
and answered greed this point the figure became more visible Gerald could now see a humanlike
face it was mostly human but a little bluish gray you could see the eyes a
thin nose a small mouth the figure proceeded to ask him more questions like why humans use money asked him about the
use of a Atomic power and weapons uh Gerald replied that he did not know the answer to these questions
and would have to get back to him at which point the figure faded away he did
tell a shift Commander was not happy about it who said basically to just shut up and not tell anyone about it but
Gerald was intrigued enough that he returned to this spot repeatedly over the years hoping the figure would return
but it never did however there was an interesting aftermath because following this encounter Gerald says he began to
have numerous visions and dreams of very technicall looking drawings of strange
craft and flying devices powered by some sort of plasma based system here's
another case 1979 teacher Jackie Miller was on Bradington Beach when she saw a
pulsing light on the horizon and she saw it just briefly as
it moved off toward pinless now later that night a tornado struck the area Jackie thought was quite
odd she wondered if there was some kind of connection there but in any event
this setting changed her viewpoint of the world she ended up forming a UFO group because as she says it may be a
little traumatic for someone to share their story for the first time and people want to share their weird
experiences but they don't know who they can trust without being judged just a
few more cases here November 18 2002 a mother and daughter were staying up late
to watch the Leonid meteor showers for the daughter's school science project
when they saw something that was definitely not a meteor as the witness
says it was not a shooting star because it was moving in a horizontal Direction
and a second star moved towards the first and we noticed several of these starl looking objects moving all around
they appeared to stay in pairs we saw them come to abrupt stops in mid-flight
make right angle turns and do 360° circles they made a full circle in
their area and would make a 90° turn or shoot across the sky they appeared to be
dancing across the sky in pears except for the Lone Star my daughter and I woke
my husband up and he too came out and saw the phenomena so yeah these are clearly not
shooting stars and it was almost exactly one year later on November 15 2003 at
5:30 p.m. that a man and his two daughters were driving along State Route 64 in Bradenton when one of his
daughters suddenly shouted out what is that in the sky and looking up the
father saw a glowing object come to a stop in midair and as he says my
daughter then pointed out another object and my other daughter daughter also saw
one for a total of three I have no idea what they were but I've never seen an
object move that fast and then stop and come to a hover a moment later there was
a bright flash and the object that I originally saw was gone followed by two more flashes in sequence and the other
two objects were gone one final case researched by muon field investigator George Hopper was 800m O October 22 2016
two witnesses used binoculars to observe an object that they said looked like two long white florescent bulbs with a
reddish light at the base kind of giving the UFO the appearance of a triangular shape this is the interior was dark but
would give off red and blue flashes and they watched it for a full 20 minutes
until it finally departed there you go a whole laundry list of cases of all kinds reaching way
back to 1949 all the way up to 2016 pretty darn recent cases involving
direct contact with humanoids again with that theme we see so often ETS showing
great concern for our violence and use of nuclear material in any
capacity definitely some interesting cases so thank you very much you guys
for providing that location Marina and John I learned a lot so that's it for today
10 locations all over our planet mostly us I admit but you know you provide the
locations and I will look them up so yeah from England and Canada as well
full range of cases all kinds of evidence supporting them the time for skepticism is over there are far too
many cases to deny it's that simple as much as our government would like to explain all of these away or when I say
governments secret governments cabal intelligence agencies top levels of the military the
military-industrial complex they have worked very hard to debunk this subject
while knowing full well it's real and have us believe that all encounters can be explained as hoaxes hallucinations
misperceptions and mental illness which is laughable I mean the cases in this
episode alone should be enough to convince the thickest skinned skeptic
it's my opinion just presenting the facts as we know them you can make up your own minds about it so thanks once
again for watching you truly appreciate it you guys I'm doing this research for you and to be honest for myself because
I'm still trying to figure things out but for everyone on this planet we all deserve to know the truth about what's
going on so thank you thank you thank you I truly appreciate you guys tuning in and until next week keep searching
for the truth it's out there keep asking those hard questions it's up to you to do it and most important of all keep
having fun cuz if you're not having fun what are you doing I will see you all
next Friday bye for now
