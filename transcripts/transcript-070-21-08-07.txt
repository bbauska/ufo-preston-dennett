TOP FIFTY UFO BOOKS
Aug 7, 2021

Summary:
Aug 7, 2021
Hundreds of books about UFOs and extraterrestrials are published each year. In fact, there are so many books, that it is nearly impossible for anyone to read them all. Many of these books are re-hashes of old material. Others are simply not very good. Many fantastic books get buried under an avalanche of mediocre books.

Today, there are many thousands of UFO books, and yet only a small portion have made a truly valuable contribution to our understanding of UFOs and extraterrestrials. With so many books flooding the market, how then is someone able to differentiate between the good, the bad and the ugly? How can we choose which books to invest our precious time and money in?

Of course, what constitutes a great book is a matter of subjective opinion. And yet, excellent research is fairly easy to identify. Many people have asked, what are the best UFO books? Which books are worth reading? This video presents a top fifty countdown of what (IMHO as a longtime UFO researcher) are among the best UFO books ever written. 

These are the UFO books that are considered classics of ufology, books that have become runaway bestsellers, books that have been well received by the UFO community, books that have undeniably shaped our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Hopefully this list will give the prospective reader a starting point, or offer some suggestions for books that will provide an accurate, truthful and interesting overview of the very complicated subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials.

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal 
got a really unique episode for you today i'm doing this by request because a number of you 
have asked me what ufo book do you think I should read what's the best ufo book 
and that's a very difficult question to answer so I decided to make a list of what I think 
are the top 50 ufo books that everyone should read and that's the title of this episode the top 50 
ufo books this is of course a very arbitrary decision another person may have come up with a 
very different list but this is mine i'm going to start from number 50 and count on all the way to 
what I think is the number one ufo book and this turned out not to be an easy decision I thought 
it would be but it wasn't there are a lot of books that I wanted to include which I couldn't include 
and in fact some researchers I think could have had multiple spots on this list so I decided 
to instead sort of focus on ufo researchers and pick their very best book so in a way this is 
also the top 50 ufo researchers of all times but no it's really the top 50 ufo books and I picked 
the best book from each researcher or what I think is the best book but many researchers 
have produced books that I think absolutely deserve to be mentioned but just were edged 
out there just wasn't enough space on this list and i'd like to give just brief honorable mention 
to a number of these I would include uh yvonne smith's book chosen I loved barbara lamb's book 
uh alien meetings I believe it was called uh there are many books that deserve a place on this list 
night siege by philip and bragnell jalen heineck and bob pratt story of the hudson valley ufo wave 
NIGHT SIEGE
jim maher's book alien agenda is an excellent overview of the ufo phenomena ed walters book 
ufos over gulf breeze loved that book it's very interesting nick pope a very prolific researcher 
who wrote a book called uninvited definitely deserves a place in your library I love the 
book by mark davenport visitors from time which discusses time anomalies associated with ufos it's 
a unique book which was just barely edged out the book any book by michael sala particularly 
secret space uh program uh again he got edged out uh but yeah I would definitely recommend 
any book by michael sala bob pratt's book ufo danger zone was fascinating but just didn't quite 
UFO DANGER ZONE
make the list I wish I could have included the books by frank fischino braxton county monster 
and shoot them down I love his research kathleen martin and denise stoner are excellent researchers 
i really wanted to include their book the alien abduction files but that got edged out as well as 
did ray hernandez's book which he edited beyond ufos it's a huge contribution to the ufo field 
i loved the book called humanoids by charles bowen which he edited it's a fascinating book about 
humanoid reports and one of the first books actually to talk about humanoids associated 
with ufos I loved australian researcher bill chalker's book hair of the alien what a good book 
HAIR ALIEN
should have had a place on this list but just got edged out as did the book abducted by ann andrews 
from england she wrote a book about her son and her whole family's encounters 
with ETs her son is jason andrews that's a really good book I would highly recommend it as I would 
also recommend beyond my wildest dreams by kim carlsberg a fully illustrated 
very well written just a fascinating book about her own encounters with ETs 
i recommend the books by brad steiger as well he wrote a lot of ufo books uh he's 
ALIEN MEETINGS
among the most prolific of ufo writers his book alien meetings was excellent I love brad steiger's 
research because it's all original he brings out information that other people have never I mean a 
lot of books are kind of rehashes of old material not his any book by jenny randles as well the book 
abduction was a great overview the pennine ufo mystery I also love the book behold 
a pale horse by milton william cooper which is really a book about government conspiracies it 
does touch on ufos pretty extensively deserves a place on this list just kind of got edged out 
as did the book chariots of the gods a real classic by eric and eric von daniken 
i don't know why I didn't put that on the list I really should have I know some people are going to 
be angry that their favorite ufo book didn't make this list but I had to make a choice so I chose 
the top 50 and let's just get to these books right now because these top 50 books I think absolutely 
deserve a place in your library each one has made a very valuable contribution to our understanding 
of the ufo phenomena has really shaped our beliefs about ufos and extraterrestrials and that's why 
i wanted to put together this list so people have an idea of what to read if they're looking 
into researching the ufo phenomena so let's just get started onto the top 50 countdown of the best 
ufo books of all times and for number 50 I chose ellen crystal's book silent invasion the shocking 
discoveries of a ufo researcher it's an excellent book a real page turner about one researcher's 
experiences and insights into ufo activity particularly in the hudson valley area of let's 
upstate new york it's got some very interesting photographs a lot of very interesting things to 
say about ufos it's a real suspenseful page turner of a book I highly recommend it for number 49 
i chose sky crash by brenda butler and dot street this is a story about the rendel shim 
ufo incident this is very famous case the you know bentwaters woodbridge there are many many 
cases or many many books written about this case but skycrash was the first it broke this case wide 
open and that's why I think it deserves a place on this list number 48 I chose mysterious valley 
by christopher o'brien mysterious valley is the story of the ufo activity in the san luis valley 
in colorado and boy this is fascinating I mean you could learn everything you need to know about ufos 
from this one book by christopher o'brien can't recommend it enough it's a really excellent book 
with a follow-up book called enter the valley so yeah if you want to read a good ufo book look into 
the mysterious valley by christopher o'brien for number 47 I chose ufos generals pilots and 
government officials go on the record and this is by leslie keane a mainstream journalist and 
i chose this book because it's a great book to give to ufo skeptics this book really I think 
gave a lot of legitimacy to the ufo field it brought in a lot of skeptics it helped popularize 
this subject and these are witnesses are pretty much unimpeachable this book proves that ufos 
are a real phenomena and uh not the product of hoaxes hallucinations or misperceptions as 
the us military would have you believe it's an excellent book that deserves to be read 
and for number 46 I chose an absolutely pioneering book called book of the damned by charles forte I 
had to put this book on the list because charles fort was the first person to write about ufos 
he's absolutely the pioneer of ufology and opened this subject and he absolutely deserves a place on 
this list his book does cover a lot of paranormal stuff but it was the first to look into ufos too 
and that's why I included it and now we move to number 45 and for 45 I chose the book don't look 
up by danny gordon and paul dellinger danny gordon was a mainstream news man 
who got embroiled in a ufo wave in his hometown of wytheville virginia this book don't look up 
boy it's a page turner it is very exciting uh absolutely deserves to be read it's a little 
bit of a sleeper you probably haven't heard about it but you should have because it is an excellent 
book on a ufo wave that very few people know about another real sleeper of a book I gave to 
the number 44 slot and this is a book by walter webb a real pioneering researcher 
and the book is encounter at buff ledge it's a multi-witness ufo abduction case 
and it's very well written it's a fascinating very well researched account 
of a ufo abduction it's an excellent book i'm surprised more people haven't heard about it 
and I think it people would really enjoy it and that's why I gave it the number 44 slot 
and now for number 43 I chose the book the keepers by jim sparks jim sparks is pretty 
well known within the ufo field unlike a lot of abductees he remembers his encounters fully 
consciously and his book is fascinating and really gives a lot of insights into this phenomena a 
lot of insights into the alien agenda and I just found it to be a very sincere moving and uh very 
i'm just an interesting book absolutely I would recommend it and now we move to number 42 
which is magic eyes only by ryan wood was also done with the research of his father bob wood 
this is about ufo crash retrievals and if you think roswell's the only ufo crash just read this book magic eyes only and you will see that ufo crashes while not 
common are certainly not as rare as you might think there are well over a hundred of them and 
ryan wood's research into the whole ufo crash retrieval phenomena is quite comprehensive and 
this book is a great overview of the whole ufo crash retrieval phenomena and deserves 
to be read and now we move to number 41 and for 41 I chose another book about ufo crashes 
but it's called cosmic crashes by the prolific ufo researcher author 
nick redfern he's written a lot of books and I think cosmic crashes is one of his best 
and I highly recommend it if you want to know about ufo crashes 
across the world this is one that you should definitely read and now we move to number 40 
and this is a great book it's called inside the black vault by john greenwald jr 
john greenwald has been investigating ufos pretty much his whole life ever since he was a teenager 
he's been using the freedom of information act to get government documents about ufos released 
and uh his website by the same name inside the black vault is just a huge contribution to this 
field love this book you absolutely should read it if you haven't because there's no one quite 
in this field who is as active as john greenwald in terms of using the freedom of information act 
to get information out of the government and into the public's awareness so yeah read inside 
the black vault by john greenwald and now we move to number 39 and for 39 I chose a unique 
book called messengers the author is mike clelland he's a highly respected ufo researcher he's got a 
THE MESSENGERS
number of other books messengers is his first and I think probably his best so far at least 
i love this book it's got all new information a lot of first-hand research into very unusual 
aspects of the ufo phenomena that you don't hear a lot about synchronicities screen memories 
the owl connection it's a really interesting book and I highly recommend it he's a very um 
respected researcher who you know really does his leg work so uh I appreciate mike clelland 
as a ufo researcher and his book messengers definitely deserves a spot in your ufo library 
and now we move to number 38 and for 38 I chose humanoids amongst us by albert rosalies 
this is actually a multi-volume series of books all about exclusively humanoid encounters 
stretching back to the 1800s all the way to the 2000s so well over a hundred 
years of accounts from all over the world these are cases all collected in one spot 
about people who've had humanoid encounters this is an indispensable tool for ufo researchers 
i mean I can't recommend it enough this guy has done his research and I just thank god for 
albert rosalie's and his exhaustive research into humanoid encounters I found his multi-volume set 
humanoids amongst us to be among the most helpful in terms of a research tool and just fascinating 
stuff all about humanoid encounters and let's move along there are a lot of really good books here 
any one of these could have made the top 10 slot by the way I mean the difference between number 50 and number one is really just a matter of opinion I think uh so don't be mad at me if 
your book didn't make the list or if it's not you know ranked higher on this list because it was a 
very difficult decision doing this countdown at any rate for number 37 I chose top secret 
magic by stanton friedman stanton friedman is wow one of the best researchers out there 
it's really a shame he passed away he was doing such excellent work very highly respected 
we owe you know the roswell incident really to him the book the roswell incident was based largely 
on his research but I chose top secret magic because he talks about mj 12 and the secret 
government cover-up group uh he dug deep he proved that you know astronomer donald menzel 
was more than likely a government agent uh he proved that there is absolutely a cover-up of ufos 
and any book by stanton friedman I would highly recommend uh but this book top secret magic 
you absolutely have to read it i'm pretty sure you will like it and now we move to 
k slot number 36 um I think this might surprise some of you I chose a book by timothy green 
beckley a pioneering ufo researcher editor of several ufo magazines 
been around forever he just recently passed away we've lost a true superstar in the ufo field 
and it won't be the same without him but the book I chose is ufos among the stars which is an 
absolutely unique book and one of the only books to talk about celebrity encounters so here we have 
encounters by a large variety of celebrities from like musicians rock stars movie stars you name it 
muhammad ali helen wheels I mean I could go on these are very famous people who have seen ufos 
and this book is just so entertaining and fascinating and given the public's 
fascination with celebrities this absolutely makes a valuable contribution to the ufo field 
i think you'll enjoy it very much and that's why I included it on this list so moving along and for the number 35 spot I chose ufo contact from reticulum by wendell 
c stevens this is another superstar in the ufo field he's published and co-written 
a number of books about ufos particularly contact cases I very nearly included his uh 
multi-volume set ufo photographs from around the world instead but decided that ufo contact 
from reticulum was a little bit better because it tells the story of bill herman's ufo 
contact and also has some very clear ufo photographs photographs of alien artifacts 
this is a very fascinating contact d case which is not well known but certainly caused a lot of 
attenti a lot got a lot of attention from major ufo researchers when it first became revealed I 
highly highly recommend wendell c stephen's book ufo contact from reticulum it's got two parts 
actually and i'm pretty sure you will enjoy it so I gave it a slot on this list now for number 34. 
for 34 I chose a book by british researcher philip mantel love his research he's highly respected 
been in this field for decades and his book without consent is an excellent book about 
on-board ufo encounters ufo abductions with many unique cases you can't read about anywhere else 
it's a huge contribution to the ufo field and 100 percent deserves a place in your ufo library 
if you want to know about ufo abductions that's a very good buck and now we move to number 33 
and number 33 probably could have landed anywhere on this list and would be right at home 
uh for number 33 I chose fire in the sky by travis walton which is actually 
sort of a release of his book the walton uh incident 
and uh fire in the sky wow what a good book this is one of the most famous cases in the world 
the travis walton ufo abduction I know there's some controversies surrounding it but i'm a huge 
believer in this case I think the evidence for its veracity is overwhelming and if you want to know 
what happened to travis walton fire in the sky the book is absolutely 
a gripping read of what happened to travis walton can't recommend it enough and now we move to 
number 32. and for number 32 I chose the book flying saucer conspiracy by major donald kehoe 
THE FLYING SAUCER CONSPIRACY
and I could have chosen any book by major donald kehoe he absolutely 100 deserves a place on this 
list the ufo field would not be the same without him he's one of the first government insiders 
to say hey your own government is lying about what they know about ufos major donald kehoe is 
a true hero to this field of ufology his books are excellent and reveal many first-hand cases 
of ufo encounters that he investigated personally absolutely I really look up to this guy 
the ufo field would not be the same without him we owe him a lot of debt for his books and I highly 
highly recommend any one of them but I chose flying saucer conspiracy is one of the best 
another really excellent early book an early researcher is flying saucers uncensored by harold 
FLYING SAUCERS UNCENSORED
t wilkins love his books they are very very detailed very exhaustively researched 
just filled chock-full with first-hand cases a lot of information cases you won't read anywhere else 
he's again a pioneering researcher one of the first to tackle the ufo subject 
can't recommend his research enough any book by harold t wilkins i'm pretty sure you will 
enjoy flying saucers uncensored is one of his best on another very early researcher 
a really great book that he wrote is flying saucers serious business by frank edwards 
frank edwards was a mainstream journalist who became embroiled in the ufo controversy 
was one of the first to really talk about it he popularized ufos on his nationwide ufo 
radio program we owe a lot to frank edwards he's a great researcher had a lot of 
inside sources got a lot of information out there that probably we would not have heard about 
if not for him and I highly recommend his book flying saucers serious business 
now we move to number 29 and for number 29 I chose unconventional flying objects by paul hill 
this is a sort of a sleeper of a book it's gotten excellent critical reviews I think anyone who's 
looked into it really likes it this is one of the most scientific books on the ufo phenomena and has 
some really excellent scientific insights into the nature of ufos and ufo propulsion and their craft 
i love this book you should absolutely read it I cannot recommend it enough 
and another book I can't recommend enough is ufos and the national security state by richard dolan 
this is actually a two-part volume so far two parts and covers the ufo government cover-up 
it's an excellent best-selling book with all kinds of really interesting information 
about how the us government in particular has handled the ufo situation the ufo problem 
love these books I think it's great great research and absolutely deserves a spot on this list 
now we move to number 27 and for 27 I chose the ufo evidence by richard hall richard hall is 
THE UFO EVIDENCE
another very early researcher who worked with nycap the national investigative committee of 
aerial phenomena and this is another big book that you can really give to a skeptic 
to convince them of the reality of ufos what I like about the ufo evidence is it covers many different physical types of evidence landing trace cases radar visual cases 
electromagnetic cases physiological effect cases animal effect cases he really takes a 
deep deep look at the evidence for ufos and that is the reason I had to include it on this list 
and for number 26 I chose a book by edward j rupelt captain rupelt of project blue book and the 
book is called the report on unidentified flying objects and this was a book that I don't think the 
air force wanted him to write and it is a little skeptical um I think he had some difficult time 
um knowing what he could include and what he couldn't without angering the government too much 
but he did he defected from project spilled the beans and talked about 
our own government's interest in this ufo phenomena and really laid it out in black 
and white that ufos are real and deserve to be researched it's an excellent book can't recommend 
it enough I should definitely have it in your ufo library and now we get to the top 25 and for 
number 25 I chose a book called abduction measure of a mystery by thomas e bullard he's originally a 
folklorist but uh got involved in researching ufos very early on and this is a truly pioneering book 
he was the first to really do an analytical and statistical study of the ufo abduction phenomena 
he outlined the pattern of ufo abductions he was the first to do so it's a massive massive 
uh vol multi-volume series of books uh just a huge huge contribution to the ufo field 
and I think really he'd approach it from a very scientific angle and it's 
not an easy read because it's very scientific but wow great great research can't recommend it enough 
and now we move to k book number 24. and this was a huge bestseller it revived a very old 
case which we know is roswell and for number 24 I chose the day after roswell by colonel 
philip corso this is a controversial book but it's one of very very few books to have 
hit the new york times best seller list uh it was a huge bestseller definitely revived the whole 
roswell case and put forth the idea that roswell has in fact been reverse engineered 
leading to such advances in areas of industries such as the integrated circuit fiber optics 
kevlar night vision it's controversial some people have tried to debunk it unsuccessfully I think 
colonel corso's credentials are pretty much unimpeachable and he has quite a bit to say 
about the ufo crash at roswell it's a very very interesting book and i'm not at all surprised 
it was the best seller and that's why I gave it spot number 24 on this list for number 23 
i chose the book taken by carla turner she wrote I think three books on the ufo phenomena into the 
fringe and masquerade of angels any one of them could have earned a spot on this list 
i like her research it's first-hand research she dug deep she talked about her own experiences 
some of these cases are really quite harrowing but it's really interesting first-hand research into 
ufo abductions and I think makes an invaluable contribution to this field and that's why I 
included it on this list and now for number 21 and for number 21 I inclu I chose the book 
encounters with star people by artie six killer clark she's written I think it's three books now 
four it's at least three books all about uh first hand encounters with ufos rd six 
killer clark is one of my favorite researchers of all times even though she's relatively new to 
the field she's made a huge splash she's done what no one else has done which is interview 
indigenous people from all across north and south america and told their first-hand stories 
which have never been told before it's definitely different from your standard run-of-the-mill 
abduction book wow these stories are fascinating unusual unique if you're going to pick up any 
books on ufos please don't miss out on the books by artie six killer clark I love love love her 
research and these books are fascinating wow love them so she got a pretty high spot on this list 
now we're into the top 20 and for number 20 I chose secret life by david jacobs 
david jacobs is one of the top researchers into ufo abductions in the world uh his book secret 
life is a really fascinating look into the whole ufo abduction phenomena i'm not going to say that 
i agree with his all of his conclusions but boy his research is fascinating secret life in the 
other books he's written are all must reads for sure if you want to know the truth about ufos 
what it's like to be contacted uh yeah secret life it provides absolutely fantastic research into the 
ufo phenomena and is highly highly recommended now we move to number 19 and for number 19 I 
could have chose any book by this researcher dolores cannon the custodians was a great book 
THE THREE WAVES OF VOLUNTEERS AND THE NEW EARTH
i mean all her books are great I chose three waves of volunteers the three waves of volunteers 
this is one of many of her books which continues to stay on the bestseller list for a very good 
reason her research is first-hand stuff one of very few hypnotherapists who worked tirelessly to 
hypnotize people and recover lost memories she's able to link a lot of this stuff to paranormal 
aspects of ufos her research is really interesting and there's a lot of disinformation in this field 
and I love her books because I think they're very sincere valid truthful information 
and I don't think it's any coincidence that her books are continue to be best sellers 
because they're very very interesting and have a lot of first-hand information that you can't 
get anywhere else and that's why I gave her spot number 19 on this list and now we move 
to number 18. for number 18 I chose a book by john keel a huge pioneer in this field 
one of the first to look into ufos and I could have chose any book by john keel because he's 
great but I chose the mothman prophecies which is probably his most famous and well-known book it's 
about ufos and the whole weird series of events that occurred in uh west virginia I believe it was
the whole mothman humanoid sightings but lots of ufo encounters in there as well 
it's a very interesting book john keel is one of few researchers who have tackled the paranormal aspects of ufos and the mothman prophecies is a gripping unique unusual 
book that deserves absolutely to be widely read and I think you will enjoy it very much 
and now we move to number 17. and first number 17 I chose a 
book by highly respected researcher robert hastings the book is called ufos and nukes 
and I love this book because robert hastings dug deep this is a big book and it absolutely 
cements in stone the fact that ufos are very very concerned about our use of nuclear power 
very concerned this absolutely shows there is a connection there that ufos are visiting nuclear 
bases nuclear missile sites nuclear-powered craft of any kind nuclear weapons ufos are 
there if you want to know about the e.t agenda when it comes to their concern of nuclear power 
you absolutely should check out this book ufos and nukes by robert hastings I loved it 
and for slot number 16 I chose glimpses of other realities by linda moulton howe 
there are very few people who have been in this field for as long as linda molten howe 
she's probably best known for her research into the whole cattle mutilation phenomena but she is today a very active researcher into ufos 
she hasn't written a lot of books but I had to include at least one of them on this list and so 
i chose that one she's a very highly respected researcher and I think has had a huge influence 
on this field and deserves a place on this list and that's why I gave her spot number 16. 
for number 15 I chose an absolutely unique book called the aliens and the scalpel by dr roger 
The Aliens and the Scalpel
lear he's really one of very very few researchers who have looked into the alien implant phenomena 
the aliens in the scalpel was a big best seller dr roger lear of course is famous for actually 
operating on people who've had alien implants and removing them and studying them scientifically and 
his research I think provides a smoking gun it's absolute proof of extraterrestrial intervention 
i do not see how anyone can read this book and not come away convinced that something very strange is going on here that ufos are real that ufo abductions are real that alien implants are being 
put in people's bodies and uh the discoveries he made will I think uh be forever remembered as 
absolutely pioneering research into this field and that's why I gave him this very high ranking on 
this list and for number 14 I chose the book ufo crash at roswell by kevin randall and don schmidt 
there are probably 50 to 100 books written about the roswell ufo crash 
i very nearly included the ufo or the roswell ufo incident by don berliner instead but this book ufo 
crash at roswell is more comprehensive it's really the seminal book well not the seminal book but I 
think the most comprehensive book on the roswell ufo crash also I love this second book in the 
series the truth about the ufo crash at roswell I think this is kevin randall's best book by far 
he's written a number of books some of which are really good some of which are just kind of making scratch my head so I don't agree with some of kevin randle's research but I really 
think that his research in particularly with this book the ufo crash at roswell is a great read 
and really gives you a good overview of what happened at roswell and wow what a book 
what a case I really enjoyed this book so that's why I gave him the number 14 slot and for number 
13 I chose the well basically the researcher jacques valet and any book he's ever written 
jacques vallee is a superstar in this field he's probably one of the best researchers out there 
he's written I think he's written just about more ufo books than almost anyone in this field 
dozens at least and I chose his book anatomy of a phenomenon because it's one of his early books 
as an astronomer he took a very scientific objective look at the ufo phenomena 
but all of his books could have earned a spot on this list messengers of deception the invisible 
college dimensions confrontations uh he's written quite a few books actually and they are all good 
edge of reality with j allen heineck I love love love the books by jacques valet and could 
i mean I could not miss out on him so he got a pretty high ranking here on my list
as the number 13 slot and for number 12 I chose a truly pioneering book called the tahunga canyon 
contacts this is by ann druffle and d scott rogo it's one of the first books to focus on a 
single ufo abduction case uh which took place in tahunga canyon california I love this book it's 
very well written it's very takes a good objective scientific look at this fascinating ufo encounter 
case which was well before this whole flood of encounters that really swept across the us and 
the world it's an excellent book kind of hard to find these days I loved it it's a real page turner 
can't recommend it enough I love these early books on the ufo phenomena and any book by anne ruffel 
deserves to be on this list and I chose the tahunga canyon contacts and for number 11 I 
chose the book disclosure by dr stephen greermd he is absolutely a controversial researcher 
but his books are best sellers and his books are very very interesting he spearheaded the whole ce5 
movement he spearheaded the disclosure movement as well and his book disclosure just knocked my 
socks off it is startling the information he puts forth in this book I think it's a 
book everyone should know about everyone should read this book it's a monumental contribution 
i think to our understanding of the ufo phenomena I loved it my hat's off to stephen greer despite 
all the controversies surrounding him whether you agree with some of his conclusions or some of his 
research or not I think you will find disclosure an excellent book so I gave it the number 11 spot 
and now we get to the top ten and boy these are the books that I think a lot of you have heard of 
and uh some of you may disagree with the books I chose for top ten but this is my list and for 
number 10 I chose encounters with ufo occupants by coral and jim lorenzen coral and jim lorenzen are 
true pioneers in this field true heroes to the field of ufology this field would not be 
where it is today without them they advanced it decades they were the first to really look into 
the ufo phenomena they formed the group apro the aerial phenomenon research organization 
was which was the first really popular ufo citizens group that got thousands 
of members and just grew and grew and grew mufon is really patterned directly after apro 
as are all the other ufo groups so yeah hats off to jim and cora lorenzen I would recommend any 
book by jim and coral lorenzen they are all good all great really and encounters with ufo occupants 
it's just fascinating stuff I am 100 sure you will enjoy it they're very respected researchers 
and what they did for the ufo field is miles and miles beyond almost any other ufo researcher 
out there that's why I gave him number 10 on this list and for number nine I think 
this might surprise some people there's only one book I know that's written by these guys 
it's written by lawrence fawcett and barry greenwood and the books called clear intent 
this is a huge buck I mean huge I mean important it was also republished as the ufo cover-up 
and what I like about this book clear intent is that it was the first to really talk about ufos 
hovering over military installations air force bases army bases naval installations 
these guys proved using the freedom of information act using first-hand interviews 
government documents they proved that our government is very much interested in ufos 
they prove that ufos are hovering over our military installations and tracking our 
technological progress uh this is the book you can give to a ufo skeptic 
and they will come away as a believer for sure if you can get them to read it I don't think a 
skeptic has a leg to stand on there's just no way you can debunk the reports in this book 
it is one of the best ufo books out there please read it i'm sure you will enjoy it and for number 
eight I chose one of the best researchers of all time leonard stringfield leonard stringfield 
UFO CRASH RETRIEVALS
is the go-to guy for ufo crash retrievals he alone was researching ufo crashes when no one else 
would touch them his books are actually a series of started out as pamphlets sort of the status 
reports they have now been published as mainstream popular books which you can find on amazon 
these status reports by leonard stringfield are all about ufo crash retrievals 
and he was the first yeah to really talk about them if you want to know about ufo crashes he 
has the info I mean he received death threats uh he was just i'm not i'm speechless when it 
comes to leonard stringfield because his research is just beyond the pale 
we would be lost without leonard stringfield's research into ufo crash retrievals he busted this 
aspect of ufo research wide open and it's because of him we take ufo crash retrievals seriously it's 
the cutting edge of ufo research it's a real shame we lost him but his books will live on forever 
i think so yeah take a look at the status reports pretty much can guarantee that you will be amazed 
and you will learn quite a bit about ufos from them and now we move to number seven for number 
seven I chose the book abduction by john mack md and I had to give john mack a real high spot on 
ABDUCTION
this list because he's a pulitzer prize winner his book is very well written it's a massive volume 
and it will pretty much I mean you could read abduction by john mack and you will know all you need to know about ufo contact I think it provides a 
really good objective look into the ufo phenomena it is not you know fear-based 
it's just very objective and uh here's a gentleman who's very well educated who tackled the cfo 
subject when almost no one else in the academic community would and so my hat's off to john mack 
and I think any one of his books could have earned a place on this list but I 
chose the book abduction because I think it's probably one of his best and that's why I gave 
him the number seven spot and for number six I chose one of my favorite researchers of all times 
timothy good and his book above top secret this is the first book to really lay down the government 
cover-up the ufo history of the government cover-up across the world the united states 
and the world some of the other books on this list I think borrowed from timothy good's research here 
and is absolutely one of the biggest contributions to this field any book by timothy good is 
excellent I love his research I love his books and above top secret is one i've read several times 
and I just can't put it down it is amazing please look into timothy good's book above 
top secret you will not be disappointed and now we move to the top five oh this is where 
we start to get the drum roll so for top five I chose the andreason affair by raymond fowler 
the andreason affair is all about of course betty andreason and her encounters with gray type ETs 
this is one of the first books to cover a first-hand case of ufo and connors it's actually 
a series of books I love raymond fowler's books all of them are fantastic the allagash abductions 
wow what a book but the his work into the andreas in affair is 
this is really a landmark book and absolutely deserves to be read it's just fascinating stuff 
and uh I think you will enjoy it very much the andreason affair by raymond fowler check it out 
you won't be disappointed and now we move to number four very nearly gave 
this book the number one spot but somehow it slipped down to number four I don't know why 
uh because it does it's one of my favorite books of all times and this is the interrupted journey 
by john g fuller this is such a good book this is of course about the betty and barney hill 
abduction the absolute landmark case the first book to publish about ufo abductions 
uh this was went off like an atom bomb I mean this really introduced people to the idea that 
we are being contacted by e.t is abducted so yeah I i love this book you can read it over 
and over again it's amazing any book by john g fuller incident at exeter is equally gripping 
what a great book i'm sure you've probably already read it if you have any interest in ufos 
but if you haven't get it right away you will be amazed at his in-depth research 
into the betty and barney hill case and for number three I chose missing time by bud hopkins 
MISSING TIME
bud hopkins is hands down I think probably the leading researcher into ufo abductions 
his book missing time was originally published by a small publisher but was republished by a major publisher and became a huge bestseller it's very objectively written with 
just transcripts of hypnosis sessions and some of his conclusions his fallout book intruders 
is equally gripping bud hopkins is responsible I think almost 
single-handedly for popularizing the subject I love love love his books
i don't think they're fear-based I think that's a very objective look the ufo phenomena 
and I really love his research I met him firsthand he's a great guy um it's a shame he passed away uh 
but his books whether it's you know the brooklyn uh witnessed about the brooklyn bridge abduction 
or intruders or unseen any of the books he's put out are fantastic books can't recommend 
him enough and that's why I gave him the number three spot and for number two I chose one of the 
biggest heroes in ufology one of the best books ever written which is the ufo experience by j 
allen heineck jay allen heineck is of course the astronomical consultant for project blue book 
and it's because of him that ufos are really taken seriously today 
he defected from project blue book was disgusted at the way they were handling the ufo subject 
criticized them harshly because he said that they would only place attention on easy 
cases that were easily explained prosaically as perhaps the planet venus or something along those lines and ignored cases that had really good potential on pay dirt 
so we owe a huge debt of gratitude to jay allen heineck and his research into ufos I love the work 
he's done all of his books are absolutely great books and the ufo experience is one of his best 
check it out for sure and you've probably guessed which book is number one and this may not be your 
number one book but this is the one I chose and that is communion by whitley strieber the reason 
COMMUNION A TRUE STORY
i chose communion is for a number of reasons it was the first book to hold the number one 
bestseller slot for many weeks I mean it stated a new york times best seller I believe for over 
a year communion went off like an atom bomb this is the first time anyone of any renown stepped 
forward and admitted to being an experiencer whitley strieber's book is very very well written 
it's gripping it's a page turner from the first page all the way to the last 
he followed it up with really interesting books like transformation uh another book confirmation 
i mean all of his books are outrageously good I love the research of whitley strieber he's still 
in this field today and the book communion is just a real wow book I love it and I think you 
will love it too if you haven't read it definitely check it out it's still a bestseller to this day 
and I think it deserves to be and that's why I gave it the number one spot because I think it's probably the single most influential book in ufo history 
though some people may disagree but that's my list from the top 50 books all the way down to 
the number one spot again there were many books I could have included oh like the missing times 
by uh um hansen is his last name which proved the media cover-up the books by george damsky 
probably deserved to be mentioned because he was hugely influential whether you believe him or not 
i mean there's a lot of books that just missed out and i'm really sorry that I didn't include perhaps a book that you're missing on this list 
uh but I did the best I could you may have noticed I didn't put any of my own books on 
this list I wanted to but I just didn't feel like it was appropriate because I have written gosh 20 
more than 20 books about ufos specifically and a bunch about the paranormal if I had to choose which of my books I would include on this list it would be a toss-up I think between 
uh the healing power of ufos which is a really unique book and the only book to 
focus on this aspect of the ufo phenomena I might also choose my book onboard ufo encounters which 
ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
is perhaps one of my most successful books or undersea ufo base I love that book as well 
uh or schoolyard ufo encounters I mean I could go on but yeah probably I would choose the healing 
power of ufos or on-board ufo and connors if I could squeeze them onto this list somewhere 
but I i didn't because again i'm the one who's putting together this list and I felt like that would just be inappropriate but I definitely wanted to give myself a little bit of a shout out 
because i've been researching this field for 35 years now most of my life 
and I feel like this is a very important field there's been a lot of research done into ufos 
and these are the books I think everyone should read and that they will absolutely convince you 
of the reality of ufos all of them have made a huge contribution to the ufo field 
and that if you want to know what you should read on ufos I think these books will are well 
recommended and well respected within the ufo field and I think you'll enjoy them very much 
that's why I wanted to put this video out so I can answer these this question I keep 
getting like what should I read about ufos well these are the books you should read 
so I hope you've enjoyed this little countdown of the top 50 ufo books I want to thank you again 
for watching I truly appreciate it I love all of you and until next time keep having fun
