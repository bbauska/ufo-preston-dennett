THREE ENCOUNTERS WITH STRANGE HUMANOIDS
Jul 5, 2021

Summary:
Jul 5, 2021
Among the most commonly reported extraterrestrials types are grays, human-looking ETs and praying mantis. Another category, however, might be termed "strange humanoids." These include aliens that are only rarely reported or are apparently completely unique. 

This video presents three cases involving "strange humanoids." The first case involves a young child who was visited for a period of two weeks by strange blue-skinned dwarfs. The second involves a businessman who was confronted by three uniquely described, ten-foot-tall humanoids. The third case involves an artist/street-vendor who had a face-to-face encounter with a dark-eyed female figure who displayed her highly unusual appearance to the witness in very public place. In each of these cases, the ETs had a message that was specifically for the witnesses themselves.

These three cases show just how strange and unusual the UFO phenomenon can be, and that sometimes people see extraterrestrials that most people have never even heard of. These cases also show that extraterrestrials can appear in places that you would never expect.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Welcome to another episode of UFOs and the paranormal. 
I've got a great episode for you today I think I call it three encounters with strange humanoids 
when people report seeing extraterrestrials the most common type is probably some variation of 
what we know as of as the grays next to that would be praying mantis and human looking 
extraterrestrials and of course reptilians beyond that however there's another category which I call 
"Strange Humanoids" and these involve a very wide variety of humanoid type beings some of which are 
only very rarely reported and some 
which appear to be entirely unique and that's what I want to talk about today 
and the first case I call case one the little blue beings the main witness in this case 
is my sister-in-law actually christine kisara denet is her name she is married to my brother 
mark my older brother and her encounter occurred in 1964 in the town of woodland hills california 
this is a pretty densely populated suburb in southern california and uh christine was only 
nine years old at the time of this incident she shared a bedroom with her little sister 
and one evening christine woke up to a very unusual site there were three short 
maybe three foot tall humanoid beings at the foot of her bed and I'll just let christine 
describe what she saw in her own words as she says they were in cloaks they were hooded so it 
was hard to see them but I could see that they were about three and a half or four feet tall 
they were very small they had little boxy hands the hands were very square and the fingers short 
the dwarves did not look human they had more square like features the face looked flat 
like the nose was squashed against the face the faces were kind of folded like those dogs that have folded faces their skin was thick and it had a bluish gray tone to it 
and I remember very clearly seeing their eyes they were really tiny black eyes that were beady and 
twinkly christie stared in fascination at these figures it was clear that they were not 
human and as she watched they pulled the blanket off of her bed and exposed her bare feet and she 
was amazed at what happened next as she says he worked on my feet with these glowing rods 
going into my feet and I was wide awake when this happened they were putting glowing rods in my feet 
these glowing rods reminded her of fiber optics fiber optic cables these rods were maybe 
six inches long about as thick as the pencil and glowed with this white light one of these 
figures was holding these rods directly against the soles of her feet she was surprised that they 
could manipulate them so easily because they had really short thick fingers but she could 
physically feel these glowing rods as they pressed up against her feet or maybe even penetrated them 
she didn't feel any pain she was not scared in the least the time she did not realize on how unusual 
this experience was she didn't try to interpret it she just carefully observed what was happening 
and at some point she asked them she sent out a mental thought what are you doing and 
the beings answered her telepathically very clearly they told her and I quote 
the message that they gave me which was inside my mind was that they were taking my memories 
they'd speak to me telepathically and say we're taking your memories and then I went back to sleep 
the next morning when christy woke up she clearly remembered this experience she didn't tell anybody 
she didn't tell her parents she didn't tell her little sister one of the reasons she didn't tell her this little sister was was because at this time her little sister was actually having some 
anxiety about the closet area she had a big fear of the closet and the closet doors being opened 
this really intrigued me because this is something I've heard from many contactees who have a fear of 
the closet I think this is because this is often where the ET's will appear in a person's bedroom 
they will come right out of the closet so christy didn't tell anybody 
and she didn't know what to think about these beings other than it did not scare her at all 
and she was surprised when it happened again in fact over the next two weeks these short little 
blue beings came every single night and it was always the same thing they'd stand by the foot 
of her bed remove her blanket and stick these fiber optic-like cables onto her into her feet 
as she says we're taking your memories they would always tell her and she had the impression that 
they were very interested in her memories and her experiences and recording them she was always wide 
awake and again it was not scary in the least as christie says I had this attitude of oh here they 
are again okay it was kind of an expected thing there was nothing unusual about it I wasn't afraid 
uh what's very interesting about this experience is it always occurred very very early in the 
morning maybe 4am or so and she never had any fear they would always wake her up and tell her that we 
need to record your memories and on each occasion she never saw them leave either she would always 
unaccountably fall asleep so this went on every single night for two weeks and after two weeks 
it suddenly ended and christy's reaction surprised her she was not happy she had come to look at 
these guys as her friends and when they stopped coming she was disappointed and sad and in fact
she reacted very emotionally as she says when this whole experience ended 
the following day my sister and I went out to the end of the driveway we were holding hands 
and we looked up to the sky and we started crying and we started saying take us back both of us 
the beings however had left for good she's never seen them before or since she grew up 
she ended up becoming an artist she worked in a variety of art jobs she did face painting she 
did some sculpture she worked at fairs she worked for a while doing graphic arts at a shirt company 
she worked as an art teacher a lot of different art jobs in the early 1980s she met my brother 
mark they fell in love got married had two kids and up until this point christy had never seen 
a UFO her first UFO sighting occurred in april of 1992 up in the mount shasta area 
the whole family had gone on vacation including mark herr myself and our family and the three 
of us mark christie and I had stayed up late hoping to see UFOs and to our shock we did 
mark saw it first this bright light in the sky we grabbed our flashlight and started flashing at it 
and amazingly it blinked back we blinked the flashlight twice and it blinked right back at us
so that was really cool and as christy says what made me thoroughly believe it was a UFO 
was the flashing that came off all around it it wasn't a focused beam it kind of flashed around 
the UFO and it didn't flash like a normal light it had more of a substance it came off slowly 
and each time it lit its light it kind of blended off into the darkness and then it went away 
so it blinked two maybe three times and that was her first sighting the second sighting occurred 
in 1994 in the heart of tapanga canyon uh at that time there was a giant UFO wave was just 
beginning to trail off and christie had gone with me and a little group to try and call down UFOs 
and sure enough one appeared I actually didn't see it I just saw the light flashing down on christy 
and the other people I wasn't able to turn around fast enough but christy saw it and as she says 
i looked up in this huge blue light filled the whole sky it was huge it brightened the whole hill 
and it was about a year later she had another sighting this was at her apartment in canoga park 
i was also there at that time we had gone out onto the front parking lot and all 
all of us including some of the neighbors christie myself and several other neighbors saw 
this kind of bluish almost translucent triangular object scooting across the sky was really quite 
impressive so those were her three major sightings and throughout all of this christy continued 
to do a lot of artwork involving UFOs from the very beginning she worked very closely with 
me in my investigations to illustrate people's encounters illustrate people's ET's and she's done 
a number of my book covers illustrated a bunch of my books and has worked with a lot of other UFO 
researchers she's become really one of the leading UFO artists in the world and I don't think that's 
a coincidence I think that's somehow connected to all of her experiences including these 
encounters with strange blue beings when she was a little girl interestingly my brother 
mark has also had a very intense encounter in which he chased a UFO with his friends 
so I think all of this comes together in a weird synchronicity at any rate uh the story doesn't end 
there at some point christy asked her little sister what she remembered as a little girl 
did she ever remember seeing ET's and christy's little sister replied that yes she does remember 
seeing beings she does not describe exactly what christy saw she doesn't remember seeing short blue 
skinned humanoids not of the type that christy saw but she does say she saw what looked more like 
cat like beings however they did have blue skin and she remembers them coming from the closet area 
she doesn't remember seeing these little blue dwarfs and she doesn't remember going to the end of the driveway and crying saying take us back take us back take us with you 
but she does remember seeing something coming into the room when they were both little girls so I think that's very significant christie also asked her mother if she's ever seen a 
ufo and her mother said no she hadn't but she did have a very unusual experience 
when she was a little girl in her home in rancho palace verdes uh this was a stu two-story home 
and uh when christy's mother was about 14 years old she was upstairs with her girlfriend and 
nobody else was home when suddenly a beam of light came through the roof through the ceiling itself 
and chased christy's mother and her friend around the house at some point it also came through the walls interestingly they don't remember 
what happened after that it's just this sort of clear isolated memory of seeing this beam 
but this is also very intriguing because it shows what I've seen in many other cases that someone 
who does have a close encounter with UFO beings this is something that often tracks families and 
it's not unusual for a person's parents to have encounters and that's certainly true in christie's 
case so that's a very intriguing case involving little blue beings I have heard other contactees 
describe these same exact blue beings in fact I showed the illustration christy made to one 
of them and she was shocked she said yes that's exactly what I saw that looks absolutely accurate 
uh I've heard other accounts as well I believe whitley strieber encountered these same 
blue beings but the next case I'd like to present involves what appears to be a 
completely unique type of humanoid I call this case a 10 foot tall extraterrestrial 
the year was 1999 and the main witness was a 14 year old kid I call martin 
that's a pseudonym he was in his basement bedroom in toronto canada martin insisted upon 
absolute anonymity he does not want his name known he's not seeking any kind of publicity 
but when martin was 14 years old he had a very scary experience it was something he found quite 
frightening he said he woke up one evening to see a humanoid figure standing next to his bed 
he wasn't able to describe it in any detail it was very very dark all he knew was that someone 
was there and he was experiencing total paralysis it was a very brief encounter but he was sure he 
was absolutely wide awake it only happened once so he sort of discounted it thought maybe it was 
sleep paralysis or something and never mind the fact that he was totally awake when it happened 
but it was definitely a strange encounter and I think a prelude to what would happened next 
as martin grew up he became very interested in esoteric subjects became fascinated by 
the metaphysical aspects of the egyptian pyramids he began to research deeply into the subjects of 
human consciousness human potential uh awareness spirituality psychic powers all of these things 
he did have a ghost encounter too actually so he has a very strong sense of spirituality however 
he's also very analytically minded he ended up going to college and getting a business major 
he's a really good guy very much a philanthropist very much interested in the 
earth's environment and helping people and I think this might be significant as well 
because that's a pattern I've noticed with people who are having encounters is they are very good people people who are doing good work for humanity and that's certainly true in martin's case 
as he grew up he met a girl a woman he became fell in love became married 
and uh this is when he became increasingly interested in all kinds of subjects including 
ufos and as he researched the subject of UFOs he stumbled upon the idea of ce5s 
close encounters of the fifth kind or calling down UFOs human-initiated encounters 
he thought this was very interesting and reading about the ce5 protocols which involve meditation 
visualization using lights to call down UFOs he decided that he would try it 
so one evening he was with his girlfriend and they decided to go camping in the wilderness outside 
of toronto canada there's a lot of really beautiful lakes out there in the wilderness 
and so they went camping and brought some flashlights and did a meditation and after 
the meditation they were surprised it wasn't long after they had finished this meditation 
trying to call down a UFO telepathically reach out when sure enough a UFO appeared as 
martin says in his own words there was this blue green static ball of light flying up the lake at 
high speed it was like 300 miles per hour and I thought what was that both he and his girlfriend 
saw it and it was very clear to them that it was a UFO and that the ce5 protocols they had just done 
worked like a charm their encounter wasn't over yet the next night they saw another UFO they 
were still at the same campsite and this object appeared and this time it stayed a little longer 
as martin says in its own words all of a sudden I see this red ball of light and I thought to myself 
that's quite strange there were no planes in this area there was no flight path of planes at all 
this was a very dark starry sky um it was immediately obvious to them that this was not 
a helicopter or a balloon or anything conventional so they ran down to the beach to get a closer look 
as martin says so the ball of light came closer it had amazing beautiful colors red 
and orange like a solid fluorescent light it went silently above us then it did a right 
turn and took off at a 45 degree angle faster than I'd ever seen anything move it took off 
unbelievably fast like in star trek it zapped almost like a laser beam it was pretty amazing 
very overwhelming it was obviously nothing of ours and it impressed him deeply and martin says that 
to him it represented quote an extremely advanced technology it was nothing humans could make 
but it was one year later in the summer of 2014 that martin had the most unusual experience of his 
entire life he and his friends decided that they were going to go to wasaga beach this is a very 
beautiful beach it's actually the largest freshwater beach in the world and it's a huge 
tourist destination they're all kinds of little cottages and shops and restaurants 
so martin and his friends all young men in their 20s decided that they were going to rent a little 
cottage and just have a little outing for a weekend along wasaga beach and it was during 
this outing late one evening around 11 p.m that martin had a very strong impulse to take a walk 
along with saga beach none of his friends wanted to go but he convinced them they were all kind 
of reluctant to do it but somehow he convinced them to take a walk and they went down the small 
pathway to the beach and were like walking along the shoreline there when something very strange 
happened and I'll just let martin describe uh what happened uh he was walking along with his 
friends most of them were ahead of him and he was right next to his best friend and as martin says 
all of a sudden they froze I looked at my very close friend and he was frozen his eyes weren't 
moving and I looked forward and they had stopped walking in front of me and I thought what are 
you doing guys he couldn't understand it everyone was completely frozen in fact nothing was moving 
he shouted out to them what's going on what are you guys stopping for but nobody answered 
as martin says my best friend was in paralysis the other guys they're all in paralysis looking to the 
left not responding to visual or verbal cues they were silent and not responding at this point the 
oz factor what we know is the oz factor sort of fell over the scene it became extremely 
quiet he felt a weird energy kind of pulsing through the air as martin says and again I quote 
it became very magnetic I felt this magnetic power come over me the moon became pulled in 
the waves stopped moving on the beach the leaves stopped moving and I thought what is going on here 
this strange energy seemed to be radiating from ahead of him and looking ahead towards the beach 
right next to the water martin saw three figures they were three male figures they looked very tall 
and suddenly martin became disoriented he had an apparent period of missing time because the 
next thing he knows he's standing right in front of these three figures they're in a triangular 
formation two standing in a row to the back and one standing right in front of them about three 
feet away and these figures were not human martin's a pretty tall guy he's just over six feet 
and these guys he estimates were nine but probably closer to ten feet tall he really had to look 
up to look at these guys and they were not human as uh he says each of these figures were dressed 
identically in shimmering black turtleneck jumpsuits with a high collar and a hood 
and martin spoke to them as martin says at first I was going to say something like 
what's going on here I thought to go up to him and say can you help me but the second I looked up 
and I realized he was three possibly four feet taller than me I mean he was like 10 feet tall 
as martin stared up at these guys all the courage that he had drained from him and he became 
transfixed by their eyes he said the eyes were massive hypnotic with blue and gold-lined irises 
as martin says his eyes were so freaking big the eyes just blew me away that's the first thing 
i looked at the next thing martin noticed was the being's mouth which was filled with dirty 
jagged yellowed teeth the skin he said on its face was pale white thick and very wrinkled 
and he had the distinct impression that these guys were very old hundreds of years old maybe 
100 200 years old and as martin says he was sort of an ugly being so what martin ended up saying 
was who are you you can't be here the being stared down menacingly at martin and with a loud 
thick gravelly voice that seemed to be in chorus with the other two beings the being replied 
we can come and go wherever we want nothing can stop us 
this was a kind of a chilling response and uh it's pretty it scared martin pretty bad as he says it 
was a power you could not believe the second I heard that I was very alarmed and I took off 
martin turned around and ran from these beings he did not look back he ran up to his friends who 
were now moving walking away down the pathway back towards the cottage that they had rented 
martin was going to ask them about these beings but by the time he reached his friends he forgot what he was going to ask them and in fact he forgot about the whole experience 
it just completely left his mind he knew something had happened but he couldn't put his finger on it 
and he walked home feeling kind of uneasy but could not remember what happened and strange 
events weren't over yet as soon as he walked into the cottage there he became overcome by an intense 
sleepiness and he just fell onto the couch and fell directly asleep which he said was very 
strange so that was how the experience ended and he probably would not have recalled it at all if 
not for a very unusual incident they decided to go back to the cottage again about three weeks later 
and that one evening he's just sitting there in the cottage when suddenly the experience three 
weeks earlier just fell back into his head he spontaneously remembered everything that happened 
taking the walk down by the beach with his friends all of them seeing these beings and everyone 
becoming paralyzed except him and finding himself in front of these beings and talking to them in 
that strange menacing message that they gave him so when he recalled this he turned to his friends 
and immediately asked them if they remembered walking to the beach three weeks earlier 
and to his surprise they did they all remembered it and martin asked them if they remembered seeing 
anything and they said yeah yeah we remember you ran up to these weird-looking people
and he said well why didn't you guys respond why didn't you respond when I called out to you 
and they just kind of looked at him stupidly and shrugged and one of them said I don't know 
we just saw you walk up to those guys and another replied we saw you go over there and that was it 
and martin asked did anything else happen that you remember and all of them shook their head that's 
all they could remember and none of them seemed to realize just how strange this experience was 
none of them seemed to realize how strange the beings looked or they couldn't see him that well and martin didn't want to get too into it because they did not know that he had seen UFOs 
previously and he didn't want to tell them that he thought he saw extraterrestrials or 
what appeared to be ten foot tall beings wearing black jumpsuits that had massive hypnotic eyes 
so he just didn't get into it with them but it was definitely a very strange encounter he's convinced 
that these were probably extraterrestrials and things it might be linked to the fact that he 
was doing ce5 work shortly before this uh he's not sure but that's what he thinks 
happened he did tell his girlfriend because she had been there with him when he saw the UFOs and 
she was shocked but very supportive she of course totally believed him uh he was somewhat emotional 
about it because it was a very profound experience for him though he didn't think it was necessarily 
a negative experience he didn't think that these guys were evil or anything but it was quite 
alarming particularly that message and it wasn't a very nice experience either as he says and I quote 
the fact that they froze my friends and messed with time and space and all that that's not right 
in my opinion since then martin hasn't seen any more UFOs but he wouldn't be surprised if he saw 
them again he's absolutely now convinced that UFOs and extraterrestrials exist and that's what he was 
really wondering that's why he was doing ce5 work and he definitely got an answer and he now knows 
they exist and for now that's good enough for him and this is an experience he will always remember
now we move to the third case which I think is the most unusual ev of all I call this case three 
don't look up this case occurred in april of 1981 to two brothers who want to remain anonymous 
i call them david and daniel david and daniel are self-employed artists they work making 
jewelry which they sell as street vendors in the san francisco area 
and in fact they were on beach street where they rent a little booth to sell their jewelry and 
this is where their experience happened it was a bright sunny day and 
david was looking for his booth space when a strange thought came into his 
head it was a very clear distinct thought which said don't look up 
martin had no intention of looking up so he's not sure where that thought came from 
but it kept popping into his head over and over again so at some point he finally looked up 
as david says now I was even more confused so just out of curiosity I decided to look up the sky 
and I was shocked high in the sky above giro delhi square was a very strange looking cloud 
it was shaped like a perfect circle except it had uniform ruffles which seemed to be moving 
slowly around the edge it had a strange white luminescence emanating from it 
david turned to his brother and said hey check this out and they both looked upward 
and this cloud which was about 1 000 feet high started to move lower and lower 
and as it moved lower the brightness faded and this cloud began to shrink and disappear 
and in place of the cloud they now saw a solid looking football shaped object 
as david says it had very pointed ends and was now self-illuminating with a very bright 
pure white luminescence similar to the light from a welder's torch the cloud completely 
disappeared and all that remained in the sky was the bright white football shaped object 
the two of them watched this thing for about 15 seconds when it began to move even lower uh mind you this is a very crowded area this was a very obvious sighting they both 
thought everyone around them was probably watching this thing there were hundreds of people there 
so what happened next was even more strange as david says I couldn't take my eyes off of it as it 
descended I began to think that the object was a UFO and that it was getting so low that I thought 
it was going to land right where we were standing and I thought to myself that's close enough stop 
i don't want to get abducted and immediately the object stopped on a dime and sat there in the sky 
maybe 300 to 500 feet above us so it clearly responded to his mental thought at this point 
he could see this object clearly they both could he estimates that it was about 30 feet 
long 15 feet wide and it sat there very plainly in full view of everyone and they were pretty excited 
they thought everyone must be looking up at this and now the world will know that UFOs are real 
and something strange happened as david says then it began to move to the right all of a sudden the 
second object appeared where the first object had been my heart literally skipped a beat as 
i realized that there were now two identical bright white football shaped objects as they 
watched these two objects slowly meandered off and moved over the san francisco bay area 
moving slowly and they soon reached the area of angel island angel island is a little island uh 
it's got an altitude of about 700 800 feet and it's right there in the san francisco bay area and 
these two brothers watched these two objects move right over to angel island and disappear behind it 
so these objects had to be below the elevation of 800 feet because again 
angel island its highest point is only 788 feet in altitude and after that the objects were gone 
and their sighting was over but they did notice one other strange detail as they were talking 
about what had just happened they looked around and saw that nobody else had seen this object 
everyone was just going about their business as if nothing happened that shocked them because 
this thing was so low so obvious that they thought everyone should have seen it 
and david turned to his brother said you know the weirdest thing was I got this thought in 
my head don't look up and it kept recurring over and over again don't look up don't look up 
and david's brother daniel was amazed because he also had a similar strange thought as 
he said the thought that he got was to look down and check if your shoes are untied 
and he did and his shoes were not untied they were tied up normally like he knew they were so that 
was strange because this thought kept going over and over in his head and that's when this setting 
occurred so now I'm wondering if this sighting was just for these two brothers and that the ET's or 
the UFO occupants were using some kind of reverse psychology to convince the two brothers to look up
whatever the case it was a very strange sighting which might be related to what happened next 
uh this next incident occurred about 10 years later in 1990 
in the same exact area in the garage delhi square along beach street in san francisco 
david was standing about 30 feet away from his booth where he sells handmade jewelry his brother 
daniel had gone off to use the restroom so david was alone uh and just watching his booth to make 
sure that if anyone was interested in buying something he would walk over there but he was 
standing yeah about 30 feet away when something very strange happened mind you this is midday and 
what I'll just let david describe what happened next as david says in his own words we had our 
display set up at the same location where we had our first sighting my brother had just gone away 
to use a restroom and I was standing about 30 feet away from our display leaning against the front 
end of a parked car watching a large group of people look at our rings I noticed two individuals 
a male and a female walk up to my table and they both stopped directly in front of my display 
they were both wearing identical tan ankle length trench coats which I thought was very strange 
the female had her back to the group of people who were surrounding my table and she appeared to be talking to the man although he was 30 feet away david could clearly hear their conversation and it 
took him a few moments to realize that the reason he could hear them is because he was listening to 
them telepathically he could hear them talking in his head that wasn't immediately apparent to him 
but later became very apparent these two figures were pretty much normal looking 
they looked human as far as he could tell from where he was standing the man was caucasian 
he was about six feet tall he was thin lanky and had brown hair and was wearing a hat 
the woman was also caucasian uh looked normal she was very attractive he said and 
was probably about six inches shorter five and a half feet and he heard them speaking he heard the 
woman first in his head he heard the woman say I'd like to see what these people are looking 
at is that okay she was asking her companion and her companion replied okay but only for a while 
and as david says the female turned toward our display stepped right behind the people who 
were standing around our display and leaned forward to see what everyone was looking at 
she had short black hair and was very attractive and I thought to myself I wish you would try on 
one of my rings so I could come over and talk to you and to my surprise she immediately turned her 
head in my direction and looked at me directly in the eyes I heard a female voice in my head 
here's why I can't try on your rings she then turned her body toward me pulled her hands 
out of her pockets and raised them up to her chest it looked like she was blocking them 
with her body to keep them from being seen by anyone else she wiggled all her fingers like 
she was trying to show me she could move them and they were functional however instead of 
normal human hands and fingers her hands and fingers were black long thin and looked like claws 
similar to what a crow's black toes look like she quickly stuck both her hands back into her pockets 
so that no one else would notice them and then the male began quote talking to her I could hear 
it in my mind he was telling her that they had to leave and that she must tell me not to follow 
them otherwise there was going to be quote a big problem they both walked past me on the sidewalk 
i was no more than ten feet away as they passed me the female looked at me directly in the eyes and 
mentally told me that he told her not to tell me to follow them and mentally told me that he told 
her to tell me not to follow them or else there would be a big problem I mentally told her that 
i already heard him tell her that and tell him not to worry I couldn't follow them because if I did 
all my jewelry would be stolen as she passed me on the sidewalk and looked directly in my eyes 
it looked like she had completely black eyes though I can't be sure I was in shock 
they both continued walking down the street and disappeared among all the other people
were these aliens walking among the public among the general population david thinks so 
obviously he can't be sure he also wonders could this possibly be related to the UFOs 
he had seen with his brother some 10 years earlier again he can't be sure 
what he does know is that these people were not normal humans there were many strange things about 
them the way they were dressed was strange their conversation was strange the way they were acting 
was strange and particularly the way the lady turned around and showed her weird claw like hands 
i mean that was highly unusual the whole telepathic aspect all of this points towards 
the very strong probability I think that he was dealing with extraterrestrials in a public place 
which may sound unusual but there are quite a few cases in which people have seen 
et's in public areas so that appears to be what's going on in this case it's a very 
unusual encounter to say the least turned out not to be david's last sighting or daniels for that 
matter it was some 18 years later on may 5th 2008 when they were treated to a second UFO sighting 
david and his brother were in their workshop which is located about seven miles outside of san 
francisco and they stepped outside and saw quote a bright red object was hovering just above the bay 
near the bay bridge and as they're watching it this was during the day a plane approached 
and this bright glowing red object disappeared and as the plane moved off into the distance the 
object reappeared it was in a slightly different location slightly dimmer and then it moved off 
and was gone and that was his last UFO sighting up to this time again he's not sure if it's related 
to his very bizarre encounter on beech street in san francisco but it could very well be uh it's 
absolutely a bizarre encounter involving beings I've never heard anyone describe before or since 
all three of these cases I do present in my latest book wondrous 25 true UFO encounters and the 
reason I wanted to do this video is because a lot of people who see extraterrestrials or what appear 
to be extraterrestrials describe beings that are only very rarely reported or sometimes are 
strikingly unique perhaps never seen before or since interestingly what people are describing are 
humanoids almost universally people describe beings that have two arms two legs 
a head you know a face eyes often people are struck by the unusual eyes and that's certainly 
true in all three of these cases so that's why I wanted to do this little video to let people know 
that sometimes humanoids are a lot stranger than just grays or praying mantis or human looking ET's 
there's another category of strange humanoids of all kinds so that's it for now I want to 
thank you once again for watching I hope you've enjoyed it and until next time keep having fun
