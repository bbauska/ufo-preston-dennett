THREE USO CASES WITH HUMANOIDS
Jul 17, 2021

Summary:
Jul 17, 2021
Compared to UFOs, reports of USOs (unidentified submersible objects) are relatively rare. Even 
more rare are reports of USOs with humanoids. Only a small handful of these kinds of cases exist. 
And yet, the stretch of water known as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro Channel, along the southern 
California coast, has produced several USO cases with humanoids.

This video presents three such cases, all in close proximity to each other. The first case 
involves a UFO landing on a beach at Playa Del Rey, an encounter that has stunning new 
corroboration. The second case involves a baffling USO encounter off the coast of Catalina 
Island, an incident which involves many strange aspects that have yet to be explained. The third 
(and perhaps most remarkable) case occurred at Lake Casitas (a human-made reservoir,) located a 
short ways inland on the northern end of the Santa Catalina channel. In this case, the witness 
actually managed to photograph the USO as it emerged from the lake. This entire area is extremely 
active and has produced more than 150 UFO/USO reports stretching back at least 100 years, and it 
is still going on today!

Why is this area so active? What happens when someone sees a USO with humanoids? What exactly is 
going on here? This video offers a small glimpse into one of the strangest aspects of USO activity 
in this area.

For those who would like to explore further, these cases and many others are presented in my book, 
"Undersea UFO Base: an In-depth Investigation into USOs in the Santa Catalina Channel." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos 
in the paranormal today's episode is called three uso cases with humanoids 
usos unidentified submersible objects are relatively rare certainly compared to ufos 
and uso cases involving humanoids are even more rare exceedingly rare and what's interesting about 
these three cases that I'm presenting here is that they all occurred in the same general area which 
is off the southern california coast specifically along the coastline overlooking the san pedro 
santa catalina channel this is a very active area with hundreds of cases on record 
however only very few involve humanoids so that's why I wanted to do this episode and the first 
case I call case one landing at playa del rey this is actually a classic case it's appeared 
in numerous ufo books and is quite interesting and also controversial though it has never been 
proven a hoax and I've been able to locate some very interesting corroboration of this event 
it occurred very early in the morning at about 5 40 a.m when a witness a general electric company 
employee by the name of richard kehoe was driving along a street called vista del mar this street 
runs directly along the beach there very close to the water itself and as richard was driving 
very early in the morning suddenly his car stalled and as he exits his car he sees that 
his car is not the only one that has had stalled in fact there are three other cars 
that also stalled at the same time so clearly this is no coincidence the other two witnesses include 
ronald burke of redondo beach and joe thomas of torrance as these three gentlemen exit their cars 
all of them notice something that has landed on the beach only a few yards away from them 
so very close it's a large egg shaped object and they described it as being surrounded in a bluish 
haze and the object itself was tan or cream in color and had two large metallic rings 
around it and the object itself appeared to be resting on these metallic rings and as these 
three witnesses are observing this object they are shocked to see two strange looking figures emerge 
and according to the witnesses these figures had sort of yellowish green skin and were 
wearing what appeared to be be black leather pants white belts and light colored jerseys 
these two strange figures approached the three men and began to ask them all kinds of 
bizarre questions in what appeared to be perhaps a foreign language or garbled english it's not quite 
clear but the gentleman could understand them but had difficulty understanding them and according to 
the main witness richard kehoe and I quote I don't expect anyone will believe me except someone else 
who's seen the same thing we were so frightened we couldn't think of much of anything they wanted to 
know where where we were going who we were what time it was and questions like that their skin 
seemed to be a sort of yellowish green but they looked like earth people to me so this was a very 
brief encounter after asking them this series of questions the two figures quickly returned 
to this egg-shaped craft which promptly took off upwards zipped away very quickly and was gone 
and as soon as this craft left all of the four cars immediately started back up and the witnesses 
continued on their way one of the witnesses 
joe thomas was particularly frightened by this encounter and he called the police to report it 
and it was this that caused this case to become well known it caught the attention of reporters 
who were able to locate the witnesses and speak with them or at least to richard kehoe 
and the case quickly became very well known one of the researchers who looked into it 
was a researcher by the name of ida bell epperson and she tried very hard to locate the witnesses 
could not find ronald burke or joe thomas but did eventually locate richard kehoe who refused to 
talk to her however richard kehoe did appear on a television program it was called the confidential 
files and it was hosted by paul v coates who would often tackle controversial issues and according to 
paul v coates richard kehoe did appear on his show and discussed this incident in some detail 
so it's a very interesting case to say the least uh itabel epperson wasn't entirely convinced 
that the witnesses were being truthful although she was not able to talk to them directly however 
what's really interesting about this case is it's not an isolated event not only did it 
occur in an area which has an enormous amount of activity uh on that week in fact on that day 
there were many many other cases across the united states and the world in fact I did another 
episode on this called one week in november because on this same week in november 1957 
there are quite literally dozens of cases scores of cases involving ufos that stopped vehicles 
caused electromagnetic interference of all kinds this was quite alarming this type of event to this 
extreme degree has never occurred before or since in terms of the number of cases involving vehicles 
that malfunctioned as a result of a close-up ufo encounter so this is by no means unique this one 
week in november was a huge kind of display that was going on all across the country and the world 
and this case by here in playa del rey was just one of them and that's not all 
there is further stunning confirmation of this event and in fact strengthening the credibility of 
this account are several sightings which occurred on the same day in the same location it was about 
10 hours later at 3 50 p.m and this is just about 50 miles to the south not far as the ufo flies 
a commanding officer and 12 airmen from an air force weather detachment at long beach cited no 
less than six saucer shaped objects zooming across the sky just under a 7 000 foot cloud cover and it 
was it was two hours later sometime between 605 and 7 25 pm that additional officers at 
the los alamitos naval air station reported seeing quote numerous end quote objects zooming overhead 
and at the same time local police stations in long beach reported receiving 
hundreds more than 100 calls from long beach citizens reporting ufos 
so this is really good confirmation that something very strange was going on 
on that day in this area it's certainly an unusual case and that's why I wanted to include it here 
the second case I like I'd like to present here I call a catalina uso with humanoids we owe this 
case to marvin miles who was a newspaper aerospace editor for actually the la times 
and he wrote an article about this incident and if not for him it probably would have gone unrecorded 
this incident occurred just before dawn on the morning of july 28 1962 when a chartered fishing 
boat was fishing in the santa catalina channel about six miles southeast of avalon harbor the 
skipper who is anonymous noticed some lights that appeared to be floating stationary on the water 
and he headed his boat towards these mysterious lights and trained his binoculars on them 
and to his amazement he saw some sort of structure of some kind and as this captain says and I quote 
it appeared to be the stern of a submarine we could see five men two an all-white garb 
two in dark trousers and white shirts and one in a sky blue jumpsuit 
we passed a beam at about a quarter mile and I was certain it was a submarine low in the water 
still gray no markings decks almost a wash with only its tail and an odd aft structure showing
this fishing boat captain assumed that he was seeing a russian submarine though 
it was very unusual for a russian submarine to be this close to the shore and remain in view 
and then more strange stuff started to happen this op this submarine performed a maneuver which 
left the captain totally amazed it this quote submarine started to move forward towards the 
fishing boat as if attempting to ram it and in fact it came so close that the captain had to turn 
his boat to avoid the sub which moved past them at high speeds and here's where it gets even stranger 
it emitted no noise and left no wake except for a quote a good sized swell so this alarmed the 
fishing captain and he reported it to the navy and the navy took detailed statements and attempted to 
identify the sub by showing this captain various uh photographic comparisons of subs from 
other countries germany japan russia and so forth and this fishing captain was not able to 
identify it as any sub from any of these countries so that is also unusual 
and this is when marvin miles the aerospace editor for the la times stepped in he heard 
about this incident and called the navy to verify it and he was told quote there's nothing to it but 
marvin miles believed there was something to it and ended up writing a story in a column 
about quote soviet subs but this is definitely a strange incident is this a submarine or is 
this a uso with humanoids it's hard to say but there are some strange elements to it 
not only is the this uso odd looking it did not look like any submarine they could identify 
but the people who are on the deck were dressed strangely particularly the gentleman in the 
blue jumpsuit which is often what we hear with humanoids and of course there's the 
strange way the this object behaved trying to ram the fishing boat remaining in full view 
at any rate ufo researchers jim and coral lorenzen heard about this case 
and they wrote about it and feel that it could very well be a uso piloted by ETs 
and as they say and I quote the high surface speed the lack of wake and sound and the huge swell 
makes this object suspect to that I would also add the odd shape of the submarine itself 
and its lack of fear of being observed so definitely something is very strange going on here 
it's absolutely unusual for a submarine to be that close to catalina island to the shore of 
the united states certainly possible it was a sub but it may have been something else entirely and 
jim and coral lorenzen seem to be convinced that it was and that's why I wanted to include it here 
but what I really want to talk about is this third case which I call a lake 
case three lake casitas ufo with humanoid this is a very unusual case and I don't 
think I've ever heard anything quite like this it may in fact be unique in all of the ufo uso 
literature lake casitas is a small lake it's an artificial lake located just inland 
off the coast of ventura on the north end of the santa catalina channel 
there was no lake there until 1959 when a dam was built which formed lake casitas and then 
comes this very interesting uso incident which occurred in 1964. the exact date is unknown but 
the main witness is an air force pilot who flew in world war ii and his name is frank s kinsey 
so a good witness someone who is familiar with aircraft and he was visiting lake casitas with 
his brother-in-law because they were interested in seeing this relatively newly formed lake and 
they were there not long when suddenly something very strange happened their attention was drawn 
to the lake by the sound of splashing water and it was a lot of it and as frank kinsey says I quote 
i looked out into the lake and here's this object coming out of the water 
this case was researched by mufon by mufon field investigator robert d neville 
and according to the report on this case the object that frank and his brother saw 
was quite large 30 feet across was a perfectly round spherical object with a weird cone on 
top the cone had portholes and was staying still while the object itself beneath it the round part 
was spinning furiously so this object came out of the water with such high speed that it sucked up a 
large column of water which came loudly crashing down and that's what drew the attention of frank 
kinsey and his brother-in-law as frank says and I quote when it came out of the water it was like a 
funnel sucking up water it brought the water with it due to the fact that it was whirling so fast 
i was flabbergasted it was a round object and it looked like it had a cone on top where a 
person was looking out at us a being looking out at us I could see the eyes staring at us 
i happened to have a pair of binoculars with me at the time I picked them up and looked and I 
could see a person looking out at me so yeah this is a large object frank estimates 30 feet wide 
and as I mentioned earlier the outside perimeter was rotating quickly and was emitting a noise that 
according to frank kinsey was so loud it was almost painful to his ears and he could see 
several portholes situated around this top cone section of this object 
and it was through one of these portholes that he could see this being according to frank kinsey 
this was not a normal looking window by any means as he says and I quote it looked like it was real 
thick heavy glass of some kind or maybe it might have been a plastic of some some kind so as he's 
watching this object floating about 30 feet up it was glowing sort of this dark lavender color 
and as it started to move away it glowed bright orange yellow and in just a few seconds it 
darted so quickly it was about 15 miles away and disappeared over the mountain as frank kinsey says 
it had a gleam to it it had a shine to it like nothing I've ever seen I've seen 
a lot of metals here on earth that had a high gloss but nothing like this that I've ever seen 
now frank kinsey did have a camera hanging around his neck he forgot about it at first because he 
was so surprised but as this object first started to move away he grabbed his camera and was able to 
snap one picture one photograph of this object as it moved off and you can see from this photo 
that this is in fact a solid object and in fact you can even see the portholes what's amazing 
is that he was able to capture a photograph of this object and it's obviously a solid metallic 
object what it was doing there in lake cassidis is hard to say there are many many cases of usos in 
what we would call reservoirs or human-made bodies of water that seem to hold a particular interest 
in these types of bodies of water so perhaps it was there to investigate 
hard to say but it is absolutely an unusual case there are cases where people have seen 
occupants looking out through portholes but as far as I know no one has ever seen an occupant 
looking out of the porthole of a uso that just came out of the water while also managing to 
photograph it so that makes this case absolutely unique in all of the ufo literature as far as I 
know it's the only case like it but as I mentioned earlier these three cases are just a small portion 
of the many many cases that have occurred in this particular area I covered these three cases and 
more than 100 others in my book undersea ufo base an in-depth investigation into usos in the santa 
catalina channel but again very few of these cases involve humanoids and that's really why I 
wanted to do this episode today such an active area and in fact this is the same exact area 
where the u.s navy has recently reported seeing unidentified objects flying over their ships and 
also even more recently in fact in 2021 this year there was more activity I recently 
reappeared on josh gates's show expedition x to talk about the activity in this area 
and they went out there with their crew to try and capture these usos on film and were successful 
captured at least three uso incidents on camera in this exact area so something is definitely going 
on here uh it's a very active area and still ongoing and I think it's important people know 
about it which is yet another reason why I wanted to do this episode but that's it for now I want to 
thank you once again for watching I hope you've enjoyed it and until next time keep having fun
you
