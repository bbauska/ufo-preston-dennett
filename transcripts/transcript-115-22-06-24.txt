Summary:
Jun 24, 2022
Each UFO encounter provides another piece of the puzzle and offers new insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. This video presents five new and original cases, each of which occurred within a small radius of each other. Each case in this UFO contact cluster contains strange and profound elements which illustrate certain aspects of UFO behavior.

--December 1968, Paul Allione steps outside his home in Palos Verdes, California and observes an unusual string of lights hovering at low elevation over the Santa Catalina Channel. He grabs his walkie-talkie and attempts to make contact. To his amazement, he overhears a ship's communication talking about the sighting as it is occurring. He soon learns that he is not the only witness to this sighting, and in fact, hundreds of people are seeing the same thing.

--April 1975, George Gray is driving west on the Santa Monica Freeway when he sees a strange, illuminated object sending down colorful beams of light. When the object darts across the sky, he realizes he's witnessing an actual UFO. He immediately attempts to telepathically communicate with the object, sending it messages of love. To his amazement, the object seems to respond and comes zooming towards him. George pulls over along the Pacific Coast Highway and a has a close-up encounter that he will never forget.

--Summer, 1980, Donald and Bonnie X. and their children (and neighbors) all view an unidentified red, glowing object silently hovering over their home in Santa Monica. They view the object through binoculars and are amazed to see that this object is semi-circular in shape, and stationary in the sky. Even with binoculars, they are unable to identify it. It's something they've never seen before or since. And then, two days later, they receive incredible confirmation of their sighting from a source very close to home.

---Summer, 1980, private pilot Toshi Inouye is flying at 2000 feet elevation over the Santa Monica Bay, providing flight instruction to a young student. Shortly after contacting the local airport tower and receiving clearance to land, Toshi and his student view a large, shiny, cigar-shaped light hovering near their plane. Stunned, and unable to identify the weird object, Toshi grabs the radio to question the Santa Monica Airport control tower regarding the object. If there was air traffic this close to him, they should already have informed him. But they haven't! And does he really want to report a UFO? Then, two weeks after the sighting, Toshi's student has a shocking revelation, showing that their sighting was just the beginning of deeper levels of UFO contact.

--August 4, 2006, retired attorney David Russo decides to take a light night walk to the beach only a few blocks from his home in Long Beach, California. David has often taken late night walks on the beach, however tonight, he is shocked to see a strange triangular craft studded with lights zooming towards him. As it approaches, the craft drops down from the sky, hovering only twenty feet over the water a short distance offshore. It performs incredible maneuvers, as if showing off. David is entranced, and time seems to stop. The sighting affects him profoundly, sending him on a journey of self-discovery that will leave him forever changed.

These five encounters represent a UFO contact cluster, all occurring in virtually the same location, and each of them providing important answers to the many questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon.

Intro
hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode coastal california ufo contact cluster five true cases each ufo counter 
provides another piece of the puzzle to solving the ufo mystery and helps us understand the et 
presence on our planet and in this episode I'd like to present to you five cases which I think 
contains some very unusual and some cases unique elements which provide some interesting insights 
into ufos and extraterrestrials and what I find particularly interesting about these cases is that 
they all took place within a very small radius of each other and very nearly the same location 
i chose these five out of well over 150 encounters so I hope you'll find it interesting and 
let's just get started and the first case I'd like to talk about I call walkie talkie ufos 
Paul Allen
paul alyon's encounters paul allen is an attorney based in southern california and as a young boy he 
had a very interesting encounter outside his home in palace verdes this was in december of 1968 he 
went outside one evening and saw a strange string of lights hovering over the ocean not too far from 
his home and I'll just let paul describe in his own words what happened as paul says I looked 
up and on the horizon I saw a set of lights that were unlike any other lights I'd ever seen before 
at first I thought it was a helicopter with a perfectly straight string of christmas lights 
on the bottom because the lights were green red and white but it wasn't moving like any flying 
object I had seen it just hovered and while it was hovering it very slowly started to tilt from 
a perfectly horizontal position to an angle but very slowly and while continuing to hover in one 
place I really to this day can't tell you what it was it's nothing I've ever seen before or since 
so as he was watching it the tilt was so severe that it was clear to him that this was 
not a normal aircraft paul rushed inside his home and grabbed his new walkie-talkies that he had 
received as a christmas gift and he thought to himself I'm going to try to talk to this thing 
thinking like a kid and to his shock he actually intercepted what he believes is a ship 
to shore transmission and could actually hear them talking about this sighting you could see 
a ship floating out in the water very close to these lights and it appeared that he was picking up the transmission from this ship and he heard a voice a male voice clearly say I don't know 
what the hell that is it's about 200 yards off my bow and it's starting to tilt and it was clear to 
to paul that whoever was talking was clearly as excited and amazed as he was so he's freaking out 
he rushed inside to get his dad and by the time they got back outside this object was gone 
the very next day paul received vindication when the evening news came on and started talking about 
quote strange lights over the water evidently the station was flooded with calls and the 
news actually sort of debunked the sighting and blamed it on two college kids setting off weather 
balloons even at that age paul knew that this was a ridiculous explanation it didn't even come close 
to matching what he saw and as he says to me that confirmed what I saw as being a legitimate anomaly 
so years later paul did appear on ufo history channels ufo hunters to describe his sighting 
and he searched for confirmation going back into newspaper reports but wasn't was not able to find 
any confirmation however as he says anyway there's my one and only encounter with a ufo 
but I can assure you it was very real so this is an interesting sighting in a number of ways 
it's one of many in this one area and also it was apparently very widely viewed not only by 
whoever was on this ship but by many people presumably along the shore because the news 
allegedly received a bunch of calls and yet they provided a debunking explanation and I think this 
just goes to show that there is in fact a ufo cover-up there's still ridicule at that time 
certainly surrounding this subject and it wasn't being taken seriously or treated objectively 
at any rate it's a pretty interesting sighting and that's why I wanted to share it with you 
and the next case I'd like to talk about I call the ufo followed us george gray's encounter george gray is a pseudonym he does not want his name used 
George Gray
he's an employee in the movie business and in fact worked on the movies star trek the 
motion picture and others star trek movies and his encounter occurred in santa monica 
and it was the week after easter in 1975 george was driving alone in his car along the santa 
monica freeway the 10 freeway heading west behind him in convoy his sister was driving along with 
her boyfriend george had recently moved into the area and was transporting his stuff 
and looking out over the ocean while still driving on the freeway he saw a very unusual object 
and I will just let george describe in his own words what he saw and what happened as george says 
i thought at first it was a helicopter because helicopters have spotlights you know it was over 
the ocean but all of a sudden I noticed that the light just zoomed towards palace verdes at 
a tremendous rate of speed and then zoomed right back that blew me away I thought wait a minute 
this is just moving too fast and then I noticed when it stopped it sent down a beam of light 
i know helicopters have spotlights but this was an incredibly different type of light it was like a 
cylinder of light actually being lowered down like a cylinder I have never seen light do that before 
most light will scatter this stayed completely uniform like a cylinder would be lowered down and 
the light was a brilliant bluish green light I could see the beach where the wet sand was 
because it illuminated it and within this cylinder of light it would send even smaller cylinders of 
light within it and those were even brilliant like a yellow lime green and an orange cylinder 
also within this other cylinder I was seeing this and I said whoa I knew right then and there 
i was witnessing a ufo as it turns out george is very familiar with aircraft his father worked on 
the apollo moon missions george himself was a huge astronomy buff and an aircraft enthusiast 
and he knew what he was seeing was unusual not only because of the way it darted across the sky 
but this unusual beam of light that it was sending down so he began sending thoughts of love 
to this object trying to sort of make telepathic contact with it he also slowed down honked his 
horn and pointed out this object to his sister and her boyfriend at this point they were very close 
to the beach and they went through the mcclure tunnel which leads from 
santa monica to the pacific coast highway and as he drove through the mcclure tunnel 
and reached the beach you could see the ufo was still there and he and his sister quickly 
pulled over and got out of their car and as george says and I quote we pulled over 
and the ufo followed us I jumped out of the van and I started walking towards it 
the ufo was over where the beach was where the wet sand was hovering maybe 100 to 200 feet 
in the air it was silver it was your basic ufo like two saucer shapes it was a light 
at first because it was still dark but when we finally got there the sun had started to come up 
it was definitely completely metallic with a silver dome on top and a silver dome on the bottom 
of it like two plates put together it had little lights around it was really something to see maybe 
100 feet across it was a relatively big craft and it was completely metallic 
definitely a silver metallic object and shiny and once the sun was breaking through you could really 
see it was beautifully buffed almost like a liquid mirror like mercury metallic it was highly buffed 
so as he's watching it send down this beam of light onto the beach it actually scared away 
a flock of seagulls george was very much drawn to it and was continuing to make telepathic 
contact with it and in fact he felt that he was successful and that it knew he was there 
and watching it as he says and I quote I really believe that it came back when I started to use 
communication telepathy because it came back and when I pulled over it was there it hovered 
there and it acknowledged that we were there but then it just took off straight up we could see it 
it didn't just disappear it went chew and it was gone it just took off so what's interesting to me 
about this case is the whole telepathic contact aspect of it this is something I hear quite often 
and telepathy occurs not only when people have an onboard experience but with sightings as well 
and another really interesting aspect about this is how george describes this beam of light 
coming down out of the craft moving slowly like a cylinder it didn't obey the inverse square law of 
light which causes light scattering instead this was a very narrow beam and it moved slowly down 
so this was a very opaque beam of light coherent light thick that you could not see through it 
with these multi-colored aspects to it clearly not normal light so why was it sending down this beam 
of light was this a little display for george I think very possibly it was and it was its way of 
saying hello I'm purely speculating here but it's a very interesting case nevertheless 
and the next case I'd like to present to you I call we had no idea what it was donald and 
Donald and Bonnie
bonnie's encounter this occurred in the summer of 1980 in the same general area in santa monica 
just a few miles from the beach bonnie and donald have two children and they were drawn outside 
when they saw this very strange object hovering quite high in the sky and in fact they were not 
the only ones who saw it their neighbors saw it as well so there was a group of about six people 
watching this object and I'll just let bonnie describe what they were looking at 
as bonnie says we all came outside and looked at it my husband saw it and my other two kids saw it 
and it was absolutely quiet and it was just hovering it wasn't a helicopter or anything 
because there was no noise it was a red light and it was the shape of a half pie pan like a 
half circle and it was red it was out there long enough that the next door neighbors came out 
and looked at it too we got the binoculars out we had no idea what it was we just kept saying 
what on earth could it possibly be if there's no noise and it's just hovering 
we don't know how far away it was I know that it's never been up there before or since it did kind of 
move around a little bit from side to side but mainly it just hovered bonnie's husband donald 
also confirmed these details also looked at this object through the binoculars and as donald says 
we just don't know what it was which I guess is what a ufo is but we went outside and looked up 
in the sky I don't remember who saw it first but it appeared to be stationary 
and we watched it for the longest time got out the binoculars I can't tell you how high it was 
it wasn't a plane it stayed in the same place and it was a lot brighter than anything else around 
after about 15 minutes this object departed bonnie and donald are not sure if it just winked out and 
disappeared or if it zoomed off really fast as bonnie says it was just gone it just went away and 
while this is a simple sighting it does have some very interesting aspects to it it had a very weird 
shape also the way bonnie and donald described it being stationary in the sky it wasn't completely 
stationary it wobbled a little bit moving back and forth this is a detail that does turn up in 
many ufo accounts and I think shows how these objects are powered or maneuvering using the 
magnetic fields of our planet which are not completely stable so ufos as a general rule 
will sort of wobble and waver a little bit another very interesting aspect of this case is that they 
were able to use binoculars to get a close-up view of it and still were not able to identify it and 
uh they never saw anything before or since and the fact that this thing moved away so fast is another 
clue that this remains unidentified not to mention also the fact that it made no noise and there 
is a very interesting and I think significant endnote to this case it was two days later that 
bonnie's parents who lived in the neighboring suburb of mar vista just a short distance away 
saw what appears to be the same exact craft and as bonnie says my parents lived five 
miles away from me they saw the same thing and their neighbors went out and looked at it and 
nobody knew what it was it was unidentified it was described just like our red thing like red lights 
so is this coincidence is this you know pure synchronicity very hard to say but honestly I 
don't think so I mean what are the chances that her parents would have the same exact sighting 
two days later and also have their neighbors come out it's a very interesting coincidence at the 
least and I really wonder if this ufo was showing itself on purpose and sort of again announcing its 
presence like they often do it's an interesting case and this next case that I'd like to present 
also has some of these same similar and very interesting details I call this next case 
Toshi
we didn't know what to do toshi in new ways encounter this occurred in the summer of 1980 
in the same place although slightly off the coast this time toshi innue is a pilot 
and flight instructor this occurred in the summer of 1980 and toshi was flying with a student over 
santa monica bay he was basically teaching the student how to fly and showing him instrumentation 
and all of this they were flying at about 2 000 feet of elevation very close to sunset and 
toshi was just showing the student all the instrumentation and had just called the control 
tower and gotten clearance to land at santa monica airport when the attention of him and his student 
was drawn to a huge glowing red cigar-shaped object not very far from their plane 
it was clearly unexplained and as toshi says this one was cigar shaped it was red 
glowing red in the shape of a cigar about two to three times bigger than a bus it looked like a 
light but it looked like a shiny shiny light it showed the shape of it it wasn't a bright light 
i couldn't see any detail of it just a reddish cigar shape it was a cigar cigar-shaped light 
toshi as a pilot is a trained observer and very familiar with aircraft but he still 
couldn't identify it and it really quite startled him as toshi says we were at about the shoreline 
of santa monica to pacific palisades usually the tower advises us of other traffic 
but they didn't right we were looking at it about 20 or 30 seconds it was standing still in the 
air glowing red we were kind of stunned we didn't know what to do so I grabbed the other microphone 
and I was going to ask if there was any other traffic nearby I was going to ask the tower 
but we didn't and I'm glad I didn't ask because it was kind of like asking if there was another 
object that looks like a flying saucer so toshi was very reluctant to report this ufo 
because of the ridicule factor because of the possible reaction of skepticism 
and shortly after I mean while he was trying to decide whether or not to report this thing 
this object quickly darted away and as toshi says he was looking at it the student I was looking at 
it and then all of a sudden it disappeared it disappeared while we were looking at it 
which means that the object moved away with a very very fast speed and that was the end 
of toshi's encounter but again there's a twist to the ending of all this a very interesting endnote 
as toshi says and I quote this student was in a car driving over the santa monica mountains 
with his friends this was about two weeks later he said that they were chased by 
the object according to him the object looked like it was following their car 
according to him it was the same one the object looked like the same shape we saw in the airplane 
so there you go another very unusual aspect to this case pilot encounters are themselves 
quite rare so that alone I think makes this case significant toshi's reluctance to report 
a ufo to the tower is a clear indication of how effective the ufo cover-up has been 
and I think it shows that probably the vast majority of pilot encounters goes unreported 
but what I find most interesting about this is first they had their sighting and then two weeks 
later the student had another sighting and I'm again I i just don't think this is a coincidence 
because often this is a pattern I see a person will have an initial encounter and shortly later 
they will have a much closer and more dramatic encounter so perhaps this indicates that there are 
deeper levels of contact going on here very hard to say but it is a very really sort of interesting 
and unusual aspect to this particular case and that's why I wanted to put it on this list 
and the next and final case I'd like to talk about in this episode I call what the hell is going on 
David Russo
david russo's encounter david russo is a retired attorney his encounter took place on the beach 
at long beach and he actually contacted me to report his case and like paul allen 
david russo also appeared on the history channel's program ufo hunters to present his encounter 
so I would just like to read to you the email that david russo first sent to me to report 
his encounter as he writes I am sending you this email with great reluctance and fear 
of being thought a kook a retired attorney a ufo skeptic and a pretty scientific minded man 
i am 51 father of two and a grandfather to one with another on the way I live two blocks from 
the ocean on long beach along a part of the city that looks directly at catalina island 
david russo's encounter occurred on august 4th 2006 at 11 30 pm when he went to the beach 
to just take a look at the stars in the ocean late one evening this is something he had done 
many times but on this particular evening he had an encounter which would leave him forever 
and profoundly changed and again I would just like to quote david russo and let him describe his 
encounter in his own words as david says an object coming from the west around the san pedro area 
caught my attention it was white and moving somewhat faster than a plane would have 
it continued southwest toward the many oil islands off the coast of long beach it changed colors 
from a white to a very cool and neat blue color as it slowed and started hovering over the water 
it's hard to guess how far away it was especially at night and over the ocean but it was probably a 
mile or so offshore I feared it was indeed a small plane or a helicopter crashing into the ocean 
instead at a height I estimate between 15 to 25 feet the object stopped it just stopped on a dime 
then I realized this was something different the object then turned a blue 
color and hovered in place for what seemed like 20 to 30 seconds no spotlight came on 
though it did illuminate the area underneath it with its blue glow at this point david could 
see that this was a distinctly triangular shaped object totally silent and pretty close offshore 
less than a mile at this point and as he says it was quite bright blue as it rotated I could tell 
it was rotating because the blue light would be interrupted three times at equal intervals 
there might have been a blue light on the underside but I could not tell with any certainty 
after what seemed like 15 seconds or so it rose higher 
changed to a reddish orange color and zipped off toward catalina island direction 
very quickly and then disappeared as it continued to rise and move away I have never seen anything 
move that fast it was amazingly fast so after it moved off and disappeared david russo was 
really shaken I mean this sighting affected him profoundly he could not stop thinking about it 
as he says with time this incident has caused me a mixture of anxiety depression and an odd elation 
i really want to know what this was but I know I never will I have taken to going to 
the shore at night with binoculars in my digital camera it has become an embarrassing obsession 
uh he heard no sound so he knows this wasn't anything normal he ended up spending quite a bit 
of money on equipment to in the hopes of observing this type of thing again as of yet this hasn't 
happened but it really affected him in a very very deep way and that was a real red flag for me 
as he wrote to me in his testimony he says I hope this helps you it feels good to get this 
off my chest what the hell is going on why doesn't the press investigate this stuff with any energy 
i have kept this bottled up for many months and the whole thing gives me both a creepy 
and exciting feeling so as I mentioned uh david russo did agree to share his encounter 
David Russo Interview
on the history channel's program ufo hunters along with paul alion and another witness he 
still feels profoundly changed by his encounter and as I interviewed him I was not really 
surprised to hear that this wasn't his first encounter and in fact he had had an encounter 
as a young boy while in the boy scouts out camping he had a very close encounter 
and as I talked to him about this current encounter I was struck by a couple of things 
one was his very strong emotional reaction to this encounter his feeling not only of elation 
but of depression and obsession this is a red flag often points to deeper levels of contact so 
i started to question him about this how far away was this object because when an object comes close 
that's also another red flag and while this object wasn't super close it was within that radius that 
i look for to indicate possible deeper levels of contact and then I asked him about time you know 
how long were you looking at this object did you check the time and uh he started to get a little 
anxious at this point because he said honestly I couldn't tell you it seemed like time stopped 
i was entranced I don't know how long this lasted he had some confusion about time and that is 
another huge red flag which I told him that there could very well be deeper levels of contact here 
so I'm not saying he was taken on board we have no direct indication of that but given the fact that 
he had an early childhood encounter which often happens with contactees given that this object 
showed up right where he was looking right when he arrived and came quite close to him given his very 
strong emotional reaction to it this feeling of relation obsession depression especially 
i think it could very well be that there was some level of contact here 
so I don't know it's hard to say only david would know for sure and at this point he hasn't pursued 
it but as he says and I quote I would rather have not seen it now there's this little piece back 
here that is always wondering and always thinking what the heck did I see and will I ever know
Conclusion
so there you go those are the five encounters I wanted to present to you today which I find so 
interesting because they all occurred in virtually the same area and each of them provides little 
clues as to the nature of this phenomena how sometimes an object will show up once and then 
shortly later show up again it shows how unusual the lights are this beam of light that george gray 
saw shows how ufos have mastered the use of the electromagnetic spectrum to a way that we haven't 
or how these witnesses describe how these lights can stop on a dime dart off so fast you can't 
follow it sort of waver slightly while hovering all of these are little clues that show how 
profoundly advanced this technology is I did present these cases in a couple of my books 
including ufos over topanga canyon and more recently in my book undersea 
ufo base an in-depth investigation into uso activity in the santa catalina channel 
and as I mentioned at the beginning of this episode each case no matter how simple it is 
is unique and provides another piece of puzzle and provides really important insights into the nature 
of the ufo phenomena and these cases I think have quite a bit to say about ufos and that's why I 
wanted to present this episode for you today I hope you've enjoyed it I really want to thank 
you once again for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers 
keep looking for the truth and most importantly I'm serious about this keep having fun bye.
