TAKEN ONBOARD A UFO: FIVE TRUE CASES
Sep 22, 2023

Summary:
Sep 22, 2023
It is perhaps the ultimate UFO encounter: being taken onboard a UFO. Unlike sightings, landings and face-to-face encounters, witnesses find themselves in a totally alien environment. The floor, the walls, the ceiling – everything around them is extraterrestrial, including the beings themselves. An onboard experience is the most extensive of all UFO encounters. They contain more data than any other encounter (except for perhaps a UFO crash/retrieval,) and often involve significant interaction and communication between the experiencer and the ETs themselves. These are the cases that have volumes to teach us about extraterrestrial contact. Here are five cases of onboard experiences. These cases provide significant evidence pointing towards the reality of UFOs and the ETs.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF JOYCE UPDIKE. In Aug 1967, Joyce Updike was cleaning her home in Platte, NB, late at night when the room filled with light. What seemed like moments later, she woke up in bed, only to find that hours had passed. Afterward, her husband found a circle of burned grass outside. Joyce had sore eyes, and some of her hair began to fall out. She became interested in UFOs, ancient civilizations, past-lives, and more. She began to have telepathy and poltergeist activity. Years later, she heard about UFOs and missing time, and realized that this is what she had experienced. Going under hypnosis, she recalled a long onboard encounter with human-like ETs who examined her and gave her messages about the future of Earth.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF ALEJANDRA MARTINEZ DE PASCUCCI. It was Jul 2, 1968, and Alejandra was walking to her home in Quilmes, Argentina when she was overcome by a strange magnetic force. Unable to move or cry out, the next thing she knew, she was lying down on a table onboard a UFO. The interior was white, spotless, with rounded walls. Beside her were two tall figures wearing glowing uniforms. While they looked human, Alejandra could see that they were “not from Earth.” They seemed to gesture to each other as they maneuvered the craft. Consumed with fear, Alejandra was ejected from the craft in a different location. Later, weird landing traces would provide more evidence of her encounter.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF JUDY KENDALL. Around 6:00 pm on Nov 26, 1972, Judy Kendall and her two sisters drove home from Zamora to Bodega Bay, CA, a two-hour trip. They were crossing the Cache Creek Bridge when the car felt weirdly cold, and an odd tiredness swept over them. They missed their exit only to find themselves crossing the same bridge twice! When they arrived home, more than four hours had passed. Their parents had called the police. Years later, Judy recalled her missing time event and underwent hypnosis. She recalled that her car had been lifted up from the highway and into a UFO. She was taken into a room and underwent a physical examination at the hands of small beings, one human-looking figure and a terrifying insectoid ET.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF KAREN LYSTER. It was a Friday night in Jan 1978 as Karen Lyster looked out the window of her hotel in Sydney, Australia to see a glowing object hovering outside. The next thing she knew, it was Sunday morning, and she was waking up in bed. She was missing more than a day of time. She later suddenly remembered that she had been pulled into the UFO and confronted by six beautiful people with dark hair, blue eyes, and flawless skin. They wanted to do tests on her hands, they said. Later, she was left alone in a weird round room. Karen decided to explore the craft. She walked down the hallway to another room where the walls turned transparent and revealed a field of stars. This was the latest of many encounters in her life.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF ANTONIO NELSO TASCA. On December 13, 1986, real-estate agent Antonio Nelso Tasca was driving on a dirt road outside of Chapeco, Brazil when he came upon a huge craft blocking the road. It struck him with a beam of light and pulled him inside. Antonio was examined by strange ETs and then was put into another room and undressed. A beautiful female humanoid entered and seduced him. After the two had an intimate encounter, she gave Antonio a long warning and a message for all humanity about the future of the planet and the need for radical change of society. Afterward, Antonio was dropped miles from the original location, with a large unexplained scar on his body. His case would become one of the best-verified in his country.

These five cases reveal many of the strange procedures that occur when people are taken onboard a UFO. They involve a wide variety of ET types and show how ET contact can affect a person profoundly in different ways. These cases also provide substantial evidence of the reality of UFOs, including landing traces, medical evidence, and electromagnetic effects. They also show that onboard encounters are occurring all over the world, and likely in large numbers. We are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the 
Paranormal I call this episode Taken on board a UFO five true cases sightings are interesting no 
doubt about that as our Landings and face-to-face encounters with humanoids but when a person is 
taken on board a craft and meets ETS face to face this is undeniable these are the most extensive of 
all UFO cases these are the cases with the most information that really let us know who et's are 
where they come from why they're here what their agenda is on our planet and what it's like to have 
direct contact with them not to mention providing an enormous amount of evidence of all kinds 
and I've chosen five cases from all over the world switching back from the 1950s up to the 1980s 
that I think really illustrate the onboard UFO experience so I've got two cases from the United 
States two cases from South America one in Brazil one in Argentina and one case from Australia 
and yeah these are super interesting as well and I think really important that people understand that 
this is in fact happening and that's really why I wanted to do this video because these are normally 
the most important of all UFO cases but they're the most interesting as well so let's just get 
started and the first case I want to talk about I call the onboard experience of Joyce Updike 
this one took place in Platte Nebraska beginning in the 1950s and actually another experience in 
the 1960s which isn't unusual for a person to have multiple encounters but this case is 
really interesting because I think it typifies a lot of the things we see when people have an 
onboard experience particularly on how profoundly it affects a person the main witness in this case 
is Joyce Updike she's not the only witness though Joyce grew up in North Platte Nebraska 
and had no idea that in 1959 she had been taken on board a UFO was actually an experience in August 
of 1967 that woke her up to the fact that she was a UFO contactee one evening around two to a.m a 
UFO landed right next to her house in her farmyard she was actually washing the house at the time 
when suddenly the room filled with a very bright light and I'll just quote Joyce directly as she 
says I looked out the window to see where so much light was coming from the entire yard was filled 
with light resembling that of welding torches it was too bright to look at I became very frightened 
I am an extremely protective mother but I didn't even check on my seven children to make sure 
that they were safe I simply put out the lights locked the door and went to bed frankly I never 
did believe that I could behave that way it didn't seem right that I could have gone to bed but I did 
I woke up during the night with all my clothes on and on top of the bed covers In the Heat of 
August nothing quite made sense so she didn't know what to think of this experience now Joyce 
was later interviewed by author researcher Ruth Montgomery she wrote the book aliens Among Us and 
much of Joyce's story is presented in that book so following this 1967 incident Joyce's husband 
didn't say anything at first but he later admitted that he had in fact found a large Burn Circle in 
the grass next to their Barn so this was evidence that something had landed next to the house 
so again Joyce didn't know what to make of that incident but it changed everything for her at that 
time she really loved reading historical novels but she stopped reading them and became obsessed 
with reading about UFOs ESP psychic development reincarnation ancient Mysteries religion Atlantis 
and these kind of topics she also noticed some other interesting After Effects she noticed that 
her hair started to become quite thin her eyes and also the eyes of her two-year-old daughter 
would become very red and inflamed all kinds of psychic events began to occur she had Poltergeist 
like activity plaguing the household she also began experiencing telepathy and her children 
too her children began experiencing precognition out of body experiences past life recall and 
more she couldn't wear watches as they would always break she also began having experiencing 
also began having episodes of missing time she worked at that time as a bookkeeper and at her 
job fellow employees noticed that she was a little bit different she was always electrically charged 
so that experience had a profound effect on her not only physically but psychically 
and then in 1980 after watching a TV show about unexplained phenomenon 
she heard about Dr Leo sprinkle he's a well-known UFO researcher who also was at that time 
hypnotically regressing people to recover missing time in fact he was one of the first to ever do it 
so she contacted him and made an appointment to be hypnotized and while under trance she did recall 
having a benevolent onboard encounter which she wasn't even aware of which took place in 1959 
and as Joyce says I had no conscious memory of it but it seems that it was all pre-arranged it 
took place in North Platte Nebraska in October I drove my little red Rambler station wagon out 
to the pasture to meet two space people I was barefoot and wearing a house dress and apron 
so she got out of her car and there were these two human looking men wearing spacesuits and helmets 
there was a craft landed a short distance away and these two men led her on board this craft 
and as Joyce says in her own words I found myself inside it on an examining table two men were 
standing at one side of the room they appeared to have removed their bubble helmets and simply wore 
winged type skull caps their bodies appeared well-formed neither excessively short nor tall 
now she couldn't see their faces clearly but she did see another man dressed in what 
looked like a doctor's outfit who began to examine her with strange instruments 
she also has some memories of seeing what looked like strange sort of star Maps 
but the ETS did tell her that at some point there will be major Earth changes and that 
people across the planet will be rescued this is a message a lot of contacties get 
so at this point Leo sprinkle hypnotized her to the 1967 incident and she again recalled being 
taken from her home and onboard a craft where she was physically examined by human looking ETS Joyce 
has spoken a few times about her encounters but has remained largely out of the UFO scene 
and later she did actually remarry a gentleman who also turned out to be a UFO contactee 
this is another thing we see quite often so Joyce's case does illustrate a lot of the many 
After Effects contact his experience so that is the onboard experience of Joyce Updike and yeah 
a very compelling case with Landing traces some really dramatic physiological effects 
to me the most amazing are the psychic effects which affected not only Joyce 
but her entire family really interesting also that she was given warnings and messages that 
there will be a mass evacuation or rescue that's certainly something a lot of contactees talk about 
so a pretty compelling case all around and here's another one that is equally compelling I call this 
one the onboard experience of Alejandra Martinez de pescucci of all the cases I'm presenting today 
this is probably the briefest but it's still a really interesting case and this one occurred in 
quellms Argentina and yeah has some interesting things to say about what it's like to have UFO 
contact this next case is probably the shortest of the ones in this presentation but it's still 
a very interesting encounter it occurred on July 2nd 1968 again in quilms Argentina 
and the main witness in this case is Alejandra Martinez de Pascucci and I'll just quote Alejandra 
directly as to what happened she says as always I was walking when I reached the corner of alveer 
and savedra I was out of my mind as if attracted by a magnetic force I couldn't resist anything I 
knew it wasn't me and that something was happening to me as if I was being influenced I couldn't 
scream or speak and I was hard immobilized but I didn't lose consciousness suddenly I saw a light 
that blinded me and then I cannot explain how I found myself on board in apparatus which was 
undoubtedly a flying saucer Through the Windows inside everything was white totally clean and with 
Windows which gave off all kinds of colors there was total silence what I did feel was when we 
began to rise from the ground I was like outside of me I didn't respond I just remember thinking 
about my children and saying what about my children I can't say if I thought or said anything 
inside this object there was tremendous Heat I think if I continued there I would roast 
this gold bracelet I have burned me it had gotten weird I would say burning 
so yeah she was walking outside of her home when suddenly she found herself on board this craft it 
was quite warm inside heated up her bracelet to the point where she could feel it and regarding 
the size of this room she says and I quote it should be about three and a half meters although 
I cannot specify anything exactly imagine my state my despair because I don't know what could 
have happened to me when I tried to get calm in Serene because already I was lost I had no choice 
so she's quite disoriented and trying to figure out what's happening really frightened and trying 
to figure out where she is and this is when she noticed that there were people inside 
as she says I saw two people who were undoubtedly not from our Earth they had a luminous appearance 
I can't describe it perfectly because the whole atmosphere inside the ship was flashing almost 
blinding one of the strangers was more than two meters tall much taller and the other was also 
tall but not as tall as the first by the way of Behaving the superiority of the Elder over 
the other was noticed I even had the feeling that one could be male and the other female only woman 
like me Intuit that the crew emitted from their hands and feet lights as if they had spotlights 
they would talk or something they would beckon they would shake their heads but I couldn't notice their faces I couldn't I couldn't tell if they were blonde or brunette but 
they seemed to me that they were not from here the only movement they made was to step on a kind of 
button that was in the middle of the plate on the floor with that they moved the device they didn't 
tell me anything or see anything else with the fear I had I tried not to lose control over myself 
as I had been absorbed by the apparatus I was thrown away I mean this is not explained very 
well but what I do remember is that they threw me on the ground I fell in the cemetery of espleda 
and there too I suffered a terrible fear looking at so many crosses now I want to 
tell you how bad people are when one needs help I went to the neighbors of the cemetery saying 
that I wanted to return to the house but no one took note of me they treated me like I was crazy 
then I got a taxi that brought me home but it didn't charge me 
so yeah she was put back in a different location from where she was taken and at 
first she thought it might have been another planet she's like wondering if this is Mars but looking around her she saw that she was in a location not far from her home a nearby Cemetery 
and she asked for help and did not receive it now what's really interesting is her son uh absolutely 
supports her story and he's got good reason to I'd just like to quote her son directly his name 
is Carlos attilio Pascucci and as he says when my mom arrived something very strange happened 
I was with some friends in the house and we all heard the sound of a buzzing sound but not a taxi 
I don't know what happened and I didn't come out but it was something very strange I believe 
that the taxi driver was not such how can you not want to charge a trip from esplata to here 
also as soon as my mom got out of the car the street light burned out and before two more 
on the corner where she says the UFO abducted her also in the corner was a hole about 20 centimeters 
in diameter and about 30 centimeters deep the grass was also scorched this didn't happen before 
so it could be that this taxi driver was not a taxi at all but was taking her home and it 
was a craft certainly this is what Carlos her son thinks might have happened and they not only heard 
it but they found Landing traces it's a pretty interesting case my heart really goes out to 
Alejandra for all the ridicule and disbelief she suffered following her encounter I don't think 
that's really fair because the people who are claiming that this didn't happen they weren't 
there they don't know and it's really difficult for a person to go through the ordeal of having 
such a major encounter and then to go through the aftermath of being ridiculed and disbelieved so 
thankfully she did have the support of her family who experienced at least part of this encounter 
and while this case wasn't super well investigated it was recalled consciously which that alone makes 
it important and here is another case which I call the onboard experience of Judy Kendall 
now this case is profoundly important this is a very early case which predated Bud Hopkins book 
missing time which sort of cemented the idea of onboard experiences into American culture 
and really all over the world this case helped to verify that missing time does happen in 
association with the UFO encounter and Judy Kendall the main witness wasn't alone in her 
encounter but she did go under hypnosis and recalled quite an extensive interaction with 
various types of ETS much of what uh the type we would call the Grays mostly but yeah provided some 
details that really helped corroborate other cases and helped move this subject forward in a big way 
that alone makes this case super important it was around 6 pm on November 26 1972 when Judy 
Kendall who was a 28 year old legal secretary and her two younger sisters danan and Becky had 
left their grandmother's home in Zamora California and headed back to their mom's house in Bodega Bay 
this was a trip they had taken before and usually took about two two and a half hours certainly no 
more than three but as they drove along they were crossing a certain point in their trip 
it's called the Cache Creek Bridge this is outside of Zamora and they were about 
to take a turn off but the turn off never came and at this point all of them began to feel an 
unnatural tiredness sweep over them in fact both Judy and one of her sisters said at the same time 
I wonder why we're not getting off the turn off and it was at that moment that they realized that 
they were crossing the Cache Creek Bridge again the second time which is impossible so they all 
felt really tired at this point but somehow made it home only to discover that it was now midnight 
this trip had taken twice as long as it should have and their concerned parents actually had already called the police now unable to explain the Lost 
Time they didn't know what to do about it and just kind of shelved the incident didn't talk about it 
however it was three years later in 1975 when Judy was watching the movie Escape to Witch Mountain 
and there's a scene in this movie where the RV of the main characters is lifted up into the air 
levitated and as soon as Judy saw this her mind flashed back to the 1972 incident and she 
recalled being in her car with her sisters when the car was lifted up into the air 
so this is fully conscious recall of being lifted up into the air inside her vehicle and she was 
really shaken by this memory and she wondered what had happened during this missing time 
and in 1977 she saw a UFO and she decided that she was going to report it which she did to the center 
of UFO studies this was an organization called kufos headed by J Allen heineck and he was quite 
intrigued by her report and he encouraged her to try hypnosis so that Year Judy was in fact 
hypnotized by Dr WC McCall and she recovered her memory of the missing hours under hypnosis she 
recalled that they were crossing the Cache Creek Bridge when a strange coldness enveloped the car 
at that point the car suddenly rose up into the air and was deposited inside a UFO 
as soon as they found themselves inside this craft still in the car she and her sisters passed out 
this point Judy does have some memory of being floated out of the car and taken to another room 
and I'll just quote Judy directly and she says I was in a room by myself it was large and hexagon 
shaped when they put me on the table I was restrained so that my head was held tight by 
something that I couldn't move and it was so painful that when I was under hypnosis I kept 
complaining about how bad my head hurt there was a very pretty black-haired woman who looked very 
human I felt like she was there to reassure me she was compassionate and said don't worry Judy 
I wondered how in the world she knew my name was like they had been watching me 
there was another group of aliens who wore skin tight gray suits had very pale white 
skin and wore oxygen-like masks covering most of their faces so Judy described these very much as 
being like the typical gray which is important because at that point there weren't a whole lot 
of descriptions of this this was not something being discussed in the media really at all 
now even though Judy did say she had a sheet felt draped over her body she felt intense cold she was 
unable to move she was very concerned about her sisters because she didn't know where they were 
however looking around she did see two small bucket seats facing what looked like a console 
along one wall had little knobs on it the short beings stood around the table that she was lying 
on and she said they had large kind of roundish yellow eyes the human looking woman was quite 
short about five five and a half feet and stood to her left to her right she saw a long hallway 
and looking down this hallway walking towards her she saw a very as she says hideous looking six to 
seven foot tall being with a very large bulbous head and sort of insectoid eyes long holes for 
nostrils he had no hair pale white skin almost to the point of being translucent in fact she said 
she could see what looked like veins and arteries enough to this point she was not experiencing 
any fear but seeing this strange being approach her made her hysterical with fear at that point 
the human looking woman began to reassure her saying over and over again it's okay it's okay 
and the insectoid being began to speak to her telepathically saying no harm will come to you 
she said it was very strange because the voice was loud like coming out of a megaphone in her head and was almost machine-like so this insectoid being put his hand on her head and echoed the 
woman saying it's okay and the woman again was talking to Judy saying it's okay Judy it's okay 
and again Judy was really surprised to hear that they knew her name at this point this insectoid like being began to examine Judy's ears studied her feet use what she 
believes was a catheter to remove urine she felt a heavy metal machine which made a loud buzzing 
noise being placed over her eyes and she wondered if this was to scan her brain somehow she did feel 
some pain as she was sort of poked and prodded and she did complain about her head hurting 
and she says she also knows that at various points during this experience the beings would 
look up at each other occasionally as if silently communicating or telepathically communicating 
so Judy was felt somewhat out of control at this point 
and she didn't find it a particularly Pleasant examination as she says in her own words 
it was like I was a guinea pig they just wanted to see what was going on with our bodies or something 
I thought that it was maybe a scientific physical examination type of thing 
they treated me like I was like we have the Apes we have mice and rats and such that we 
use for experiments I felt like I was being treated as a lower level or lower class form 
of life than they were it was like I was the dog and they were the master type of thing 
so at one point Judy did think she heard one of her younger sisters cry out 
next thing she knows the shorter beings are lifting her up each grabbing an arm or leg and 
They carried her out of the room and back to the car she said it was really interesting because as 
they reached the car they kind of threw her up into the air and she floated directly into the 
driver's seat Landing neatly behind the wheel and looking around she saw that she was alone 
in the car and she stayed that way for a short time when suddenly her sisters appeared almost 
as though they materialized there so she didn't really see how they got in there but the next 
thing she knew they were back on the road passing over the cash Creek Bridge for the second time 
so there were some After Effects following this encounter Judy like many contactees 
reported a sense of being watched and she had some ambivalent feelings about the encounter 
well she felt that it was scary she does not feel like the ETS were evil or trying to hurt her and sometimes she actually felt glad that she had this encounter though sometimes she would 
become frightened her sisters were frightened they refused to talk about it Judy however did 
speak at a 1979 conference and her account has become well known uh was written about in a few 
articles one was called against her will another was where did the road go most significantly her 
case was reported in the book The Road to strange UFOs aliens and high strangeness but her case was 
one of only a handful which became known prior to Bud Hopkins book missing time which popularized 
the subject and opened the door for thousands of people to start talking about their own encounters 
that alone makes her case very important there's some really interesting aspects to this case I 
think one that really intrigues me is the fact that while she was watching the main witness Judy 
while she was watching the movie Escape to Witch Mountain and watching this car fly up into the air 
that was a cue for her to really recall herself and her car being lifted up into this craft this 
is something we see quite often when people have missing time and while she did recall this under 
hypnosis the details she recalled are very much corroborated by other cases including what the 
examination that she went through the types of ETS she saw and so forth so yeah an important 
case on several levels and there's always another case here is another case which I call the onboard 
experience of Karen Lister I think this case is super interesting for a couple of reasons one is 
that this was recalled consciously without the aid of hypnosis again with a kind of Q 
and it provides some really interesting similarities to perhaps the Travis Walton case 
this case occurred in Sydney Australia and has some really unusual elements to it 
and it also shows that this is the UFO experience is rarely a one-off and that's certainly true in 
Karen's case with encounters stretching to early childhood and onward the main witness in this case 
is Karen Lister and she was only 18 years old in January of 1978. at that time she was employed by 
an affiliate of RCA records and she had a very unusual experience which began with a strange 
compulsion to take a vacation from her accounting job and without really understanding why she 
booked herself a room at a hotel this is in Sydney Australia she arrived at this hotel early 
Friday evening and was disappointed to discover that this was not a great Hotel it was sort of 
dirty and run down but the only really redeeming feature was it did have a nice view of the coast 
so she was unpacking in her room and it was around 6 30 p.m when she walked over to the window to 
take a look at the view of the coastline and this is when she saw a strange light in the sky 
and I'll just quote Karen directly as she says it was so intense that I wondered what on Earth it could be and why it didn't seem to be moving in any direction 
what was it and how could it hover there for such a long period of time almost as if the bright object had heard my thoughts it began to descend getting so bright 
that I had to Shield my eyes from it it seemed to be so incredibly close was now only 50 feet above 
the water and so bright that I just couldn't look at it without screwing up my eyes then nothing 
the next thing Karen knew she was waking up to see the cleaning lady entering her hotel room 
and the cleaning lady was really surprised to see her there apologize and explain that 
she thought that Karen would have checked out of the hotel by now um Karen was puzzled by 
this and explained that she had actually booked this hotel for the whole weekend until Sunday 
at that point the cleaning lady looked confused and told Karen but it is Sunday 
Karen could not believe that she was shocked she had no memory at all of Friday night all 
of Saturday day and Saturday night but the cleaning lady said it was now Sunday morning 
the cleaning lady left Karen started to examine herself in her room she saw that her shampoo 
bottle which she had brought to the hotel was now half empty that confused her because she had no 
memory of using it but she decided to check out of her room because now that it's Sunday she returned 
home and verified that it was in fact Sunday and that she was missing more than 24 hours of time 
and as Karen says in her own words there's something extremely Airy about suddenly 
realizing that you have missed a big chunk of time which you have absolutely no recollection of 
it totally disorients you to a degree that you just can't think about it without creating a panic inside that feels like you're going to lose it any moment 
so she met with her friends at her home and began to tell them about her missing Time episode and 
as she was going through it she suddenly had full recall of what happened during this missing time 
so while she did have missing time she remembered without the aid of hypnosis and as Karen says in 
her own words the very first thing I remembered was that one second I had been sitting in the 
chair watching the light and the next moment I was on board something that looked like a spacecraft 
immediately ahead of me were a bunch of people remember this happened in an instant so I was in 
a state of utter shock to find myself in this position I was terrified disoriented and like 
a cornered rabbit as I found myself standing there facing these people I had no idea how I 
got there no idea who these people were there were two men and three women the men were the 
closest to me and the woman were just a few feet behind them standing more or less side by side 
in hindsight they didn't look menacing at all in fact they were the most beautiful people 
I'd ever seen they all had jet black hair and the most Pearl blue piercing eyes I'd ever seen 
their skin was extremely pale and their complexion flawless 
so reorienting herself and realizing that something very strange was happening she grabbed 
her purse pulled the scissors out of them and held them in front of her menacingly telling these 
strange people don't come near me don't come any closer now the man standing closest to her at this 
point raised his hand and boy Karen was shocked at what happened next her metal scissors began 
to sort of curl up by themselves into a tight ball as she says I could not believe what I was 
witnessing they kept on curling until they were wound up in the tightest curl you could imagine 
so they were now useless as a weapon she put them back in her purse and at this point the man and 
the others there sort of smiled at her with mild amusement and the man said don't worry we're not 
here to hurt you we only need to look at something there is no need to worry you will be all right I 
promise so Karen at this point began to hammer them with questions asking them who are you how 
did I get here what do you want with me who are you and the man said don't worry about it you 
won't be here long you don't need to worry about all of that so Karen was Karen wasn't entirely 
convinced but asked them what they wanted and the man said we just need to look at your hands 
now this sounded absurd to her but the man just sort of smiled and gestured for her to follow him 
they walked out of this room down a cur a curved sort of upward sloping Corridor into a small 
Alcove directly off of this corridor and as Karen says there is a little machine there that looked 
like a mirrored surface it was about two feet by two feet and he asked me to place my hands on top 
of this machine as he needed to get a record so this was really puzzling to Karen she was 
absolutely astonished but followed the directions placed her hands on this cool mirror-like surface 
for just a few seconds until the man told her that they had what they needed and to please wait there 
and this man took what Karen believes was an image of her Palms 
down the corridor back to where she had come from they all seem to be very excited about this 
Karen was puzzled she looked at her Palms but saw nothing unusual and at this point the man led her about 50 feet down the curved Corridor into another room and 
told her to wait there that they would be sending her home soon so at this point Karen found herself 
alone in this strange room and as Karen says the room was the oddest shape I have ever seen 
the best I can describe it is that it was like a half diamond with slanted walls and ceiling 
to one side of the curved room there was a place to sit down which I did 
there was nothing much to look at there no windows in the entire room was a very odd 
red rust color which I found quite irritating after a while which was the reason I decided to 
do a little exploring on my own since they've left me here on my own for quite some time 
I got up and moved to the doorway and to my left was where I'd come from slanted downwards but to 
my right was the corridor which kept winding upwards so at this point she knew that she was 
probably inside some sort of craft and that the people were ETS she was very curious she peeked 
outside the corridor and decided to explore in the opposite direction from where the other people had 
come from so she turned right and started walking up this winding Corridor until it ended in a large 
room with a comfortable looking chair in the very center of the room she walked up to the chair and 
brushed to the arm of the chair with her fingers and to her amazement when she did that the walls 
and ceiling became transparent she lifted her hand up quickly and the walls turned back to normal 
so she put her fingers back on the arm of the chair and the same thing happened this really 
intrigued her so she sat down in the chair and she could hardly believe what happened next and 
again I'll just quote Karen directly as she says I delicately climbed into it and lay back with both 
hands resting on either arm of the chair this is where I find it so incredibly difficult to explain 
no matter how many times I try and explain this I can never do the awesome spectacle of it justice 
I was alone in the universe there were no walls no ceiling just myself on the chair surrounded by 
the beauty of space it was the most magical moment whoever designed something like that 
surely can't be all bad I immersed myself in the experience and hardly noticed that 
someone had now walked into the room with me so at this point she saw that this was 
the same man who had led her to the Alcove entering the room and he did not seem to be 
angry or upset but did tell her firmly to return to the room where she was supposed to be waiting 
and looking at this man she had a strong sense of familiarity like she knew him from somewhere 
and she turned to follow him back and the next thing she knew she was waking up in the hotel 
room and the maid was waking her up so as she described this to her friends she remembered 
the scissors ran to her purse fished them out and there they were just as she remembered them 
and her friends were all very much impressed and this was her evidence so she kept them very 
close to her looking at them many times she's away from home at this point she lived in New Zealand 
but she was planning on flying back there shortly then on February 13 1978 right before 
she was about to fly back there was a terrorist bomb attack next to the Sydney Hilton Hotel 
and Karen went to go on her flight she had the scissors in her luggage and she prepared 
to board the plane but security was very strong and she had to go through several checks of her 
luggage finally she was cleared to go home and when she arrived home the scissors were gone 
so she lost her evidence unfortunately but Karen like many contactees 
does have recall of being taken from her home as a young child visiting friendly human looking ETS 
who told her that they were her true family but she had to stay on Earth as she had a job to do 
she also does remember seeing Gray's as a young girl age 12. she had a gray come into her bedroom 
bend down and hold his face directly close to hers she was so scared she passed out at age 
17 she says that she was actually taken she believes to the et's planet so yeah it's not 
certainly a one-off she's had a lot of encounters but years after her 1978 experience she did have 
an interesting encounter with a palm reader and had a startling Revelation because the 
ETS had seemed to be very interested in her palms and she couldn't figure out why but as Karen says 
years later when I first visited a palmist I found out that I indeed did have a very unusual 
marking in the center of my right hand it is a point that has six lines that intercede all in 
the center creating a perfect cross in the dead center of my palm it is like the Star of David 
so she wonders if there's a connection there but this experience absolutely transformed her she 
became very interested in UFOs and conspiracies and all kinds of esoteric subjects and currently 
does have a website karenlister.com where she talks about all of these subjects and her own 
experiences so that is the onboard experience of Karen Lister and yeah pretty darn amazing and 
once again we see how powerfully this impacts a person with her becoming intensely involved 
in all these esoteric subjects UFOs conspiracies and so forth it sort of becomes a mission for a 
lot of contactees to really get the word out about a variety of these kinds of subjects 
certainly true in her case and here is the last case I'd like to present to you today this is 
probably the most extensive of all the onboard experiences I'm talking about today I call this 
one the onboard experience of of Antonio nelso Tosca this occurred in chapeko Brazil which isn't 
a huge Place certainly not back when it occurred in 1983 but it's a very compelling case there are 
corroborating Witnesses who saw UFOs in the area at the time this gentleman was taken on board 
he did remember this consciously there's some very compelling physical evidence in the form of 
physiological effects and I believe electromagnetic effects so a very interesting 
case also because it became super well known and is one of Brazil's in fact best verified cases 
and it echoes some of the details we see in one of the first recorded onboard experiences 
that of Antonio vs Boles so as we we shall see there's some very interesting details in this one 
this next and last case is considered by many ufologists in Brazil to be one of the 
best verified and most important cases in the country the main witness is Antonio nelso Tosca 
he's a real estate agent 62 years old at the time of his incident it was around 8 
pm on the evening of December 13 1983 and Antonio was driving along a dirt road about 
three to four miles outside of the city of chipako and He Came Upon a long narrow craft 
hovering ahead of him on the road now as he's coming upon this he first thought it 
might be a bus until he saw that this object was actually hovering just above the ground 
and he continued to drive up to it stopping his car about a hundred feet away to get a better look 
and he can see now that this craft had about 10 square portholes arranged in a row along the 
top section of this craft the craft itself was about 30 feet long and nine feet high 
and long enough that it blocked the entire width of the road it appeared to be resting on 
a beam of light and it glowed with this green light and seeing that this was very unusual 
Antonio turned off his car turned off the headlights got out of the car and walked 
towards this object and he approached to within about 30 feet at this point he could feel a strong 
heat emanating from the craft this concerned him so he started to walk backwards keeping his eye 
on the object up to his car and he finally reached his car still looking at this object 
and he reached out and touched the car door handle to get back inside and at this exact moment a 
yellow beam of light about three feet wide came from the object swept towards him and engulfed him 
and the second the light hit him this beam which was very unusual began to retract back into the 
craft and Antonio was shocked to see that this beam of light was actually carrying him towards 
this object and he was unable to resist unable to move or react as he felt himself being pulled 
right inside of this object as he got real close you can see that this object was in fact metallic 
and gray in color and as he was pulled through the wall of this object he lost consciousness and when 
he woke up he found himself laying down on a flat surface unable to move in a very cold dark room 
and remembering what had just happened being struck by this beam of light he thought at first 
for a second that he had been pronounced dead and was buried inside a coffin and this caused extreme 
fear he began to gasp for breath started crying but found he was unable to call out or even move 
his body and at this moment he felt a blast of warm air heard footsteps approaching he said it 
sounded like three or four people walking towards him surrounding him and he felt them examining his 
body you could also hear them talking in a strange grunting kind of language the next thing he knows 
he's being lifted up carried and placed on the floor of another room and at this point the room 
became brightly illuminated although there was no direct light source the room was well lit and 
he could now see that it was a small room about eight by nine feet with rounded metallic walls 
very much like polished aluminum but there were no visible doors no windows or openings of any kind 
Antonio saw that he was undressed and his clothes had been placed in a pile next to him 
now without warning an opening appeared in the wall and in walked this beautiful woman 
uh she was very short just under four feet tall Antonio himself is about five foot six inches 
this woman had very light shoulder-length hair a light pale complexion very large blue almond 
shaped eyes that were widely spaced on her head kind of wrapped around the sides of her head a 
little bit looked very exotic I mean it was clear she wasn't human she was wearing a sort of ugly 
dress according to Antonio and she reached out her hand to him in a very friendly gesture and it was 
quite strange because at this point Antonio could hear these beautiful musical sounds in his head he 
saw beautiful colors flashing through his mind's eye and he felt this overwhelming sense of Peace 
joy and longing at this point the woman began to speak to him telepathically and said I am Kabbalah 
messenger of agalee's world I come on a mission of peace and love so Antonio asked where are we 
and the woman replied we are in the ocean 180 meters below sea level 
so Antonio's mind raced at this point and he was very confused he also realized at this point he 
was very thirsty it was absolutely overwhelmed by the woman's beautiful appearance and wondered 
if it was the fact that this woman was so incredibly exotic and beautiful that it was making 
him have difficulty thinking clearly and the woman replied to him you will drink 
right now and your thirst will pass as well as your state of confusion 
at this point he noticed that a three foot long apparatus of some kind with red buttons on it 
appeared on one of the walls the woman pressed one of the buttons and a drawer came out of the wall 
was very strange because this drawer seemed to be part of the craft itself and she opened this 
drawer and pulled out these two small kind of tube-like containers filled with liquid 
she handed one of these containers to Antonio and told him to drink what she did he drank 
this liquid which he said looked like water but was somehow lighter than water somehow different 
uh he handed her back the container she gave him the second container to drink which he did 
and this liquid wasn't water it was a thicker substance tasted kind of like blackberries 
and was slightly acidic so the woman took the container back put them both in the drawer and 
began to speak telepathically again in Portuguese his native language and said now you won't feel 
thirsty or confused before me it is time for us to fulfill a mission of great importance for which we 
have been chosen stay calm at this point Antonio asked after this will I be returned to my world 
and she said yes but there's a right time for that otherwise you will be placed a place very far from 
here where you live so she told him that they had chosen him to share a message for all Humanity 
this confused Antonio because he was neither rich nor influential he was nobody special and this is 
what he told them he said you know why did you choose me I'm nobody and she replied you have 
always believed in extraterrestrial existence and have already desired such an encounter 
so Antonio felt himself very strongly attracted to this strange woman 
and at this moment a sort of couch emerged from the wall again it was made from the craft 
itself no seams it was about three feet wide he estimates five feet long and fixed to the wall 
the woman at this point undressed herself and laid down on the couch and looked at him invitingly 
and Antonio of course was still undressed he approached and laid down with her and 
the two of them became intimate and this act of intimacy was very quick at which point she 
spoke out loud for the first time and said the word Amor the Portuguese word for love 
and she smiled but at the same time she also looked slightly sad but when she smiled Antonio 
could see you for the first time that she had very small child-like teeth they both put their clothes 
back on and she told him that as the result of their Union she would be having two children 
so this really affected him profoundly and at this point she told him that they wanted him 
to transmit a message to the people of Earth Antonio began to protest said that he didn't 
really have a good memory was would not be a suitable spokesperson for them and told her he 
said Madam as I leave here my mind will fail and I will remember only a few excerpts from the message 
point the woman approached the same apparatus on the wall pressed another button which caused 
another drawer to open and she pulled out this weird crown-like device kind of like a tiara 
which you can see here and placed it on his head and she said with this in your head you will see 
me twice telling you the message and it will never leave your memory she began to sort of adjust this 
device on his head and then she related this very lengthy message which I'd like to quote directly 
because it's a really interesting message that a lot of contactees get something along these lines 
and here's the message warning of the messenger Kabbalah from the world of agalee to the peoples 
of Earth the weapons of war must be immediately deactivated capable of ending any kind of life 
here that exists in addition to all its terrifying and deadly Devastation and all-out nuclear war 
will put the Earth off its Celestial path and cause serious disturbances to the 
lives of neighboring worlds some in dimensions a terrestrial man is still unaware of the political 
economic and financial dominations of Nations over Nations must be abolished imperialism contradicts 
the right of equality of the peoples and constitutes a new and solemn form of enslavement 
the essence of human life and its natural functions of reproduction must be preserved 
in nearby stars and in others unattainable to present-day man life arising from the breath of 
eternal spirit creator of all things God which is why it should not be this object 
of imponderable experiences because these will end in irreversible genetic disaster it is necessary 
that within the strictest Criterion of justice and morals with a view to the solution of the 
social problems resulting from disordered human proliferation organs must be instituted that by 
natural scientific means plan and execute programs of population control and biological improvements 
of man it is necessary for man to conquer other worlds in the universe and there find suitable 
places for his view future immigrations and new sources of energy in subsistence 
but first he must conquer his own world unraveling to it the enigmas that still exist on land in the 
sea and in the air preserving its Vitality important natural elements defending it from 
the subtle piracy of the outside and carrying its human imperfections of mind body and spirit 
it is necessary that having heated these exhortations Humanity be prepared 
for the period of extraordinary events of which the Earth will soon be the stage 
the great events will be foreshadowed by strange teluric electrical manifestations and Celestial 
signs of magnificent Splendor and unsettling Beauty masters of supreme wisdom will come back to 
earth renew wonderful teachings and help establish a new political Society the Earthly Paradise will 
be reborn full of light and love then through means and energies now not even supposed men 
will know the concave convex dimensionals of Earth will travel to the depths of the universe 
and will not feel the fatigue of time and as a Sublime conquest of human creative capacity the 
machine of absolute power will be put into action and Ingenuity that among many other wonders will 
give Humanity the happiest happiest and most haunting Vision it's in its entire history 
so this is the message that she gave to all the peoples of Earth even talking 
about the resurrection of those who have passed away at which point she removed the strange device put it back in the drawer and told Antonio peace and love 
she backed up to the wall disappearing through the through the wall Antonio was now alone in the room 
sadness and loneliness swept over him the room became completely black Antonio heard footsteps 
approaching and he was led into another room the same one where he had arrived laid back down the 
temperature dropped and he passed out he woke up in a completely different location which was about 
one or two miles outside of the city of chipeco he was lying on the ground it was now morning 
he estimates about 6 A.M he was unable to move for almost two hours before he finally regained 
control of his body at which point he got up walked into town and immediately called his family 
they were frantic at this point because they had found his abandoned car they had called 
the police in fact who were looking for him crisscrossing the area where he had disappeared 
so returning home Antonio explained to his family the whole story of what he remembered 
they immediately took him to the Santo Antonio Hospital where he was examined by 
Dr Julio zawadiski and other than being nervous and having some increased blood pressure he was 
found to be perfectly healthy the later that day while undressing Antonio's family didn't 
notice a strange mark on his back Antonio felt no pain or irritation from this Mark 
but it was a pretty big Mark and he went back to the doctor who said it looked like a healed scar 
there was no redness surrounding this Mark no swelling even the hair on around this Mark was 
intact so this was all quite puzzling and a closer examination revealed two 
small red dots on his chest which were slightly painful though they disappeared by the next day 
the only other effect was extreme thirst and a loss of appetite which lasted for about three days 
and at that point Antonio vomited up this yellow liquid which tasted of that 
same acidic Blackberry taste that he had drunk with the second container of liquid 
so UFO researchers did find out about this case investigated it in depth interviewing the witness 
and asking other people in the area if they had seen anything on that night in that area 
and they did they did they found two witnesses who had seen a UFO flying around in the sky on 
that same night Antonio was taken and in that same area they examined Antonio's car and they 
also found something interesting the front end of the car which had been closest to the craft 
was magnetized in a much greater degree than the back end of his car 
and another weird effect was that Antonio's car which always had trouble starting 
worked beautifully it would start immediately and this was a weird effect which lasted for about 
10 days and then returned to normal another thing they also noticed was that Antonio's 
belt buckle and belt clip and his metal watch strap also showed themselves to be magnetized 
so at some point Antonio was hypnotized to see if you could recall any other details 
you couldn't recall anything else of that fully conscious experience but he did remember that at 
age 17 he had a prior UFO encounter where he had seen a ball of Light which dropped down from the 
sky and came very close to him and he recalled being taken at age 11 from his home by strange 
men who came into his bedroom later Antonio did write a book about his experience it's called 
a man marked by ETS and he spoke publicly about his experiences many times until his tragic death 
in 2008 due to a car accident and that is the final case I'm going to be talking about today 
the onboard experience of Antonio Nelson Tosca I think provides some really compelling evidence 
not only of UFO reality but of what happens when people are taken on board and as unusual as some 
of those details are they have been echoed in other cases and not just Antonio Villas velas 
but many others so I I think it behooves us all to take these cases seriously they're a lot more 
common than people realize these five cases are just the tip of the iceberg in fact in 1991 the 
Roper organization which does polling conducted a survey and found that about 1 in 50 people 
have been taken on board a UFO show the markers of this that's millions of people and it echoes 
very closely what Jay Allen heineck the father of modern ufology said he estimated that it was 
at least one in 40 people who have been taken on board and I agree I mean I did not have to 
ask 50 people and I found several who have been taken on board and had really dramatic encounters 
so yeah much more common than people realize and these five cases I think alone illustrate what 
exactly what it's like to have ET contact shows how profoundly it can affect you on multiple 
levels emotionally physically mentally spiritually and psychically so we have a lot to learn from 
cases like these that's really why I wanted to present them that's why I do this UFO research 
because so many people are going through these experiences and we can learn a whole lot from them 
so that's it for today I really want to thank you for watching I truly appreciate it and until 
next time keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun.
