ENCOUNTERS WITH UFO OCCUPANTS: TEN TRUE CASES
Nov 24, 2023

Summary:
Nov 24, 2023
There's nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial. UFO sightings are interesting, but  these UFOs have occupants inside them, humanoids of all different kinds. This video presents ten extraordinary little-known cases of people who have had close encounters with UFO occupants. These cases span many decades and come from all over the world. They provide compelling evidence of UFO/ET reality. They show what it’s like to have contact with ETs, and also answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon.

THE SAUCER IN THE CELERY FIELD. In Oct of 1928, an 80-year-old lady was checking her celery field of her farm in northern WI and came upon a landed craft. To her shock, she saw several small figures exit the craft and run into the woods. Intrigued, she approached the craft and ventured inside. She was amazed to see little seats, a bunch of food-wafers, but very little equipment. Then officials came and took the craft away.

THE WAVERLY UFO LANDING & HUMANOID. On Aug 13, 1965, David Gibson (age 14,) and his family saw a UFO fly over their home in Waverly, IA. To their amazement, the object descended behind a hill. David ran to investigate, and saw a three-foot-tall bald creature standing nearby. The being ran off into the woods. David then saw the craft dart away. And after some exploring, he found a 20-foot circle of burned grass.

ETS INVESTIGATE EARTHQUAKE. On Jul 31, 1967, an earthquake struck Caracas, Venezuela. Three days later, afraid to be in their damaged home, Juan and Maria Desoto slept in their car. Suddenly a disc-shaped craft appeared overhead, released a smaller craft, and out came a humanoid. It examined the ground, scooping up various stones. They watched it for 15 minutes. The next day, their neighbors said they saw the UFO too.

BALD & BEARDED RED REPTILIAN ALIEN IN A GRAVEYARD. On Aug 29, 1968, a group of boys playing in a graveyard in Coleraine, Quebec, Canada was amazed to see a UFO and a dwarf-like figure. The next day it returned, and more kids saw it. Then, on the third day, the ET and UFO returned, and this time, two adults saw it. On the fourth day, more than 300 people came to see if the UFO and ET would return.

THE THING ON THE STAIRS. On Sep 15, 1968, KBJ (an officer of the British Army) was guarding the Dhekelia Army Barracks on the island of Cyprus. At around 3:00 am, a whining noise filled the room. The guard dog whimpered and hid under the bed. KBJ opened the door and saw a bizarre humanoid with glowing eyes, red hair floating up the stairs. He slammed the door shut and grabbed a gun. 

A UFO LANDED IN MY BACKYARD. One evening in Jan 1969, Adeline Davis woke up to see a landed UFO had in her backyard. She could hardly believe her eyes as she saw a strange human-looking figure staring back at her from inside the craft. For the next 20 minutes, the craft remained. At the time, all the power in the house failed. Finally the craft left, but Adeline would never be the same again.

SUCKED THROUGH THE WINDOW. On Apr 2, 1971, a man from Greenhill, NSW, Australia went to the kitchen to get a drink of water. He saw a strange face staring at him from outside. Suddenly, a strange force gripped him and pulled him through the window. He fell to the ground outside. His wife ran into the kitchen just in time to watch it happen. Unknown them, many people in the area saw UFOs at that time.

THE HUMANOID ON THREE MILE LAKE ROAD. On Oct 9, 1975, Robert Suffern drove down the road to investigate a strange glow behind his barn in Utterson, Ontario, Canada. Instead, he came upon a strange craft landed in the road. It quickly took off, but moments later, as Robert drove back home, a strange humanoid jumped in front his car. He told the police what happened, but regretted this decision.

THE CRACKNECK CREATURE. On Oct 10, 1976, a woman driving with several other cars along a road near Crackneck Lookout in NSW, Australia was puzzled to see the other cars race away. Looking up, she realized a flying saucer was pacing her car. She sped off too. Later that night, two couples at Crackneck Lookout saw a strange 9-foot-tall hairless humanoid with fly-like eyes.

THE ALIENS AT STONEHENGE. On the evening of Nov 18, 1990, a couple (Lee & Dorne) went to visit Stonehenge. Dorne was amazed to see a UFO hovering nearby. Lee strangely refused to look, but then he saw a strange 7-foot tall figure lurking among the stones of the monument. The couple fled in fear. Following the encounter, numerous strange events occurred.

These ten cases provide a cross-section of cases involving direct, firsthand, face-to-face contact with aliens. And yet, they are only the tip of the iceberg. And yet, these cases teach us many things. They show us that ET contact is worldwide, ongoing and is supported by compelling evidence. They also show us what it’s like to meet an ET, and that an encounter can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode is called
encounters with UFO occupants 10 true cases I love these kinds of cases where
people have face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials of all different kinds
I think all UFO cases are interesting but these to me are among the most
fascinating because there's little chance of misperception when someone has a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid
or an ET someone who's clearly not from here these cases I think have the most
to teach us about who these ETS are where they come from and what their
agenda is on our planet and there's so many of them I don't think the general public has any idea just how common this
is and let's face it the vast majority of people do not report their encounters
especially if it's a a very close encounter like the ones I'd like to present today so any estimates of how
common this is are probably vastly underestimated the cases I chose today
date all the way back to the 1920s up to the 1990s this is important because again it
shows this is an ongoing phenomenon I've chosen cases from all over the world so
we have cases from across the United States from Canada South America Europe of course and
Australia again important because this shows that this is a worldwide phenomena I think every
location on this planet probably has a long and Rich history of UFO encounters some of these are single
witness cases many are multiple witness cases a lot of them do have not only
corroborative Witnesses outside Witnesses but evidence as well the eviden is in the normal kinds we often
see so I'm talking about Landing traces of course animal reactions
electromagnetic disturbances and physiological effects and each case
provides another piece of the puzzle to what's going on on our planet in regards to UFOs and
extraterrestrials so 10 true cases let's just get started and the first case I'd
like to talk about I call the saucer in the celery field this is a really
interesting case because it took place quite early and yet shows some elements that we would see much
later and this took place in October 1928 in an undis disclosed location in
Wisconsin this is not a officially or thoroughly investigated case but
nevertheless I think it's an important and certainly an interesting case this
very unusual case was first revealed by Genevie Johnston who is the editor of
the Vintage UFO magazine interplanetary News Digest she received a very
interesting letter from an 80-year-old lady from Kentucky and it's definitely
one of those cases that raises a lot of questions as the witness wrote in her
letter way back in October of 1928 one of the flying saucers landed
only 50 ft from my farm in a Celly field in
Wisconsin several small people emerged and ran into the woods now according to the witness these
little men were all dressed in one piece neat fitting coveralls they were light
blue gray in color and had head caps that were fit and shaped almost exactly
like The Aviator caps of World War I she said which could be folded flat and kind
of put into a pocket she said that the these figures also all wore soft white
shoes that reminded her of moccasins and I will just quote this
witness again this 80-year-old lady from Kentucky as she says I examined the ship
very thoroughly inside and out it measured 99 ft in length and 30 ft in
diameter it had 14 Port holes on each side a small door near the front end no
mechanism of any kind for guiding or power there were seven bucket seats and
a great quantity of food near the front part of the ship this food was very
similar in size shape and texture to the Wafers we buy and feed to our goldfish
and it tasted delightful so yeah this lady actually walked inside this craft and examined it
tasted one of these Wafers very unusual so after exploring this ship she
returned to her Farm she says the little men she saw never returned but she does
say that the General Electric Company actually retrieved the craft and brought
it to their laboratory for study she says she was told that the elements this
was composed of did not come from Earth uh this incident was completely covered
up from the public though according to the witness she learned that there were at least a dozen other UFO Landings
between 1919 and 1930 throughout Northern Wisconsin and Illinois with
each of these saucers containing somewhere between 5 to seven little people
inside so yes this is a very brief uninvestigated and unsubstantiated
report but certainly this very early mention of a so-called UFO crash
retrieval it also has elements as I said that Echo future reports such as the ETS
wearing tight gray coveralls a ship with no visible mechanisms or engines inside
and even those food like Wafers she mentioned have been discussed in other
cases such as the Aztec New Mexico UFO crash of 1948 so there's some very interesting
details to this case that I think have the ring of authenticity what I like about that case
are several things the fact that it landed in a celery field I find that kind of interesting or the ETS after the
celery I don't know we don't have any indication of that but it's also interesting because the witness was able
to go on board she described the interior of the UF o with details that we often see in modernday accounts she
alludes to the possibility or the probability that craft are being recovered by our own
governments um yeah and other interesting details that we've seen in other cases which I think lends Credence
to this account so yeah it wasn't officially investigated but still super
interesting but now we move to another case which was officially investigated and I call this the Waverly UFO landing
and humanoid I like this case because it is a multiple witness case it does have
evidence in the form of Landing traces and it's just darn interesting the main
witness in this case is a 14-year-old boy by the name of David
Gibson this took place of course on August 13 1965 in Waverly Iowa
and David was sitting with his father and sister in their yard of their
Waverly home when a high pitched whining sound Drew their attention upward
looking up they saw metallic polished aluminum looking object which they
estimate was about 15 to 20 ft wide they said it looked like quote two saucers
glued together and it moved quickly overhead at quite a low level but to
their amazement it descended slowly and actually disappeared behind the hill
about a third mile away and it looked like it was coming in for a landing and
in fact they could hear this whining sound fade away so curious David the
14-year-old jumped up and went alone to investigate and going up the hill about
400 to 500 ft away from him he saw a short beam standing at the top of the
hill peeking out from behind a tree watching him here's the little drawing
he made of this so this creature he said was about 3 to 3 and 1/2 ft tall and
baldheaded uh he ran towards it to get a closer look but tripped and looked down for an instant and when he looked back
up the creature was gone so he didn't get a super good look at it but could definitely tell it was not human
and seconds later he saw a blur and heard a rushing sound like air and he
watch this same object go straight up in about two to 3 seconds he ran up to the
tree where he had seen this little figure peeking behind it and he found no evidence that this being had been there
but exploring the area he did come upon a perfectly round area of burned grass
this was in a nearby quarry and this burn patch was about 15 to 20 ft in diameter which matches what they
saw in terms of this craft and the grass inside the circle was blackened but
outside of course it was all still green and inside this burned area David did
find three rectangular indentations each about 2 feet from the
edge of the circle each of them was 1 in deep 5 in wide and one foot long what's
also interesting is that the soil in this area was hard and firm which
indicates that this object must have been quite heavy to make those
indentations so seeing this David returned home and informed his father
and presumably they went back and examined this circle because they next went to the Waverly police department
and told them about the encounter but the Waverly police refused to even exam
examine the landing site this case was reported on by Jim
and coral Lorenzen of the aerial phenomena research organization AO and
as Coral Lorenzen writes this is typical of so many reports we receive here at
headquarters valuable data at the site of the landing has been lost because of
the refusal of authorities to investigate certainly an interesting
case and what a shame that the police didn't even bother to investigate it
this just shows how effective the UFO cover up has been that officials whose
job it is to investigate anything unusual refuse to even come out and take
a look it's too bad but there's always another case and the next case I'd like
to talk about is super interesting I call this one ETS investigate earthquake
this took place on August 3rd 1967 in karacus Venezuela this was
officially investigated it is a multiple witness case and it's quite unusual
because it took place immediately following a very large earthquake that I
think is significant but let's just get into it and you can decide for yourself it was on July 31st
1967 that a 6.6 earthquake struck kacis
Venezuela this was a big earthquake and it lasted for almost a minute and an
estimated 300 people tragically lost their lives now Juan and Maria doto lived in
the suburbs of kakis in the Hills surrounding the city's Center thankfully
they were uninjured by the earthquake but it did damaged their home cracking
one of the walls and fearing that staying in their damaged home home in the days following
the earthquake could lead to further injuries Juan and Maria decided to sleep
in their car in front of their home along with their teenage son and it was 3 days after this 6.6
earthquake at around 11:30 p.m. on August 3rd that Wan doto woke up to see
a glowing white disc-shaped object hovering about 100 ft over the palm tree
right by their front door so he quickly woke up his wife Maria so she could also
see the object their teenage son slept in the back seat and they did not wake
him up but they could see this disc clearly they estimate it was about 30 ft
wide and was so bright it lit up the whole front yard including their Greenhouse which was attached next door
they said there was no wind but strangely the leaves in the tree trees were swaying back and forth they did
hear a slight humming sound and as they watched an opening appeared in the
bottom of the desk and a smaller glowing white light bulb-shaped object emerged
and descended to the ground stopping only a few inches above the ground and
then a door in the side slid open and out stepped This 3ft Tall luminous
figure dressed in a all complete with a helmet and it took a few steps and began
to pick up some of the gravel Stones which made up the gravel walkway to the house now at this point the Doos were
only about 15 ft away from this figure so very close in fact they were close
enough that they could see vapor around the figure's head which they thought
might be its breath now for about 10 minutes they watched this figure walking around and
examining the gravel picking it up he didn't take any of the gravel but would pick it up and put it back on the
walkway they did notice that the figure would tip its head back and look up at the object above him as if communicating
with it and this is when they saw the vapor apparently coming out of its mouth then every now and then it would
turn and look at the car now one and Maria weren't sure if
this figure knew it was being observed but they were too afraid to go out and confront it finally this figure stopped
picking up the gravel Stones dropped them returned back into this smaller
light bulb-shaped craft which immediately floated back up into the larger one and as soon it was inside
this larger craft the door closed and the larger craft darted away in just a
few seconds so Juan and Maria were absolutely shocked by this encounter and
even though they had each other as Witnesses they wondered if they had somehow dreamed or hallucinated the
whole experience which lasted for about 15 minutes which is a long time but the
next morning three of their neighbors called them to ask if they had seen the glowing disc which had hovered directly
over their house so they got confirmation investigators heard about
this the doas agreed to an inv investigation they initially requested
anonymity but finally did allow their names to be used and as it turns out
that summer there were many other sightings in the Caracus area definitely
a really unusual case if I was the Doo's son I'd be so mad that they didn't wake
me up what a shame but yeah multiple witness case I really wonder why the ET
was gathering the gravel and examining it could this have anything to do with
the recent earthquake I think it's definitely a possibility but it is interesting because this was just one of
several very significant UFO Encounters in that area at that time it's certainly
an important case and now we move to our next one which took place in colerin in
Quebec Canada on August 29 1968 this actually took place over a
couple of days it's a multiple witness case there's some really interesting aspects to it particularly what the
humanoid looked like and I call this one bald and bearded red reptilian in a
graveyard that's quite a mouthful but it's a really interesting case and one
of many which have taken place in graveyards this very strange case began
when a group of young boys were playing quote Cowboys and saw something very
strange the first witness was 7-year-old Dennis bogus he saw a strange figure
sort of standing or hanging on a boulder that overlooked a cemetery near his home
in cerin where they were playing but it was the next two days August 30th and
31st that got the attention of the adults because it was around 4: to 6:30
p.m. the kids were out there playing and this weird figure appeared again in the same location and this time it was
viewed not only by Dennis but by his two brothers Michelle and Andre but it
wasn't just the kids who saw it this time their Uncle George bogus and two
other adults Norman dle and Luke cateret also saw this weird figure and all the
witnesses agree on the details that this figure was about about 4T tall bald with
no hair but did have a long black beard and was bare chested this weird
dwarf-like figure had reddish skin that looked quote like that of a lizard so
was kind of bumpy not smooth and again he was seeing at this same
boulder now at one point the boys heard this roaring noise and looking for the source did see a quote Flying Saucer
they described this object as being blue white and red about 30 ft wide and it
appeared to be trying to land behind the Boulder and it was seen on both days
when it departed it left behind a sort of trail of smoke a
contrail now Uncle George mogus didn't believe the boys at first when they were talking about this but of course on
September 1st he saw it himself and the next day on September 2nd he returned to the location with
literally a hundred other people in the hopes of a Repeat Performance
unfortunately the UFO and its occupant did not show up and apparently never
returned I think there's some important takeaways from that case one is when
your children come running up and said that they've seen something pay attention to them cuz this case wasn't
taken seriously until adults themselves became Witnesses and what a case it was
taking place over a period of days with a landed craft and a very strange
humanoid I think it might be significant that it took place in a graveyard because there are many cases where UFOs
have hovered over graveyards or even landed and humanoids are seen in fact I
did a whole episode on just graveyard encounters so you might want to check
that out this case definitely belongs in that category and now we move to another
case which actually did get quite a bit of publicity if you're a real UFO
afficionado you may have heard of this one I call this one the thing on the
stairs and it's quite an unusual case it is a single witness case but it's got
some very interesting aspects to it including animal reactions and how it so
profoundly affected the witness this one took place on September 15
1968 on the island of Cyprus this case from researcher Jenny
randles got quite a bit of attention due to its extreme High strangeness the witness in this case is
known only by his initials kbj but we do know that he was an
ambulance driver who was at the time of his encounter a non-commissioned officer
in the British army stationed at dilia army barracks in
Cyprus and it was um around 300 a.m. on September 15
1968 and he was guarding a section of the upper Barracks with him was a large guard dog
a Turkish Wolfhound who was reportedly unafraid of
anything but around 3:00 a.m. suddenly the dog's hair bristled and he began
growling kbj tried to calm the dog down but then this poor dog began to shake
and cry and finally actually crawled underneath the bed in apparent fear and
it was at this point that the witness heard a high pitched sound which he said
penetrated painfully inside of his head so he got up to investigate opened
the door leading to a downward staircase to go see what was was going on and to
his fear and amazement he saw this strange figure coming up the stairs
seemingly floating and boy this figure looked exceedingly strange it was humanoid in
form it wore a tight fitting light blue overall and what looked like a dog
collar studded with lugs around its neck but it did have a very flat face
extremely large eyes what looked like thick rough red hair sticking straight
out about 4 in in all directions it had a glowing orange aura around it and as
the witness watched this figure rotated its head in an impossible
180° and stared directly at the witness this absolutely freaked kbj the witness
out and he slammed the door shut and locked it it was at this point that this
high-pitch noise increased so with his hands shaking and
teeth chattering he retreated to the bed and sat down underneath the guard dog
was still whimpering loudly and hearing this sliding noise approaching the door
the witness decided to grab a spear gun normally used for underwater and he
quickly loaded it he very nearly fired it at the door but
thankfully after a few moments he heard what he believed was this creature
Sliding Away at which time this high-pitched noise finally stopped he
was still quite frightened so he remained there unmoving until about
4:15 when the guard for the new shift arrived now following this encounter the
witness kbj said that his arm leg and shoulder achd for a week from handling
this spear gun with what Jenny randles called quote super strength but the dog
was affected perhaps even worse and became as Jenny randles writes quote a
devout coward throwing its legs up into the air on its back at any threat no
matter how insignificant this just goes to so show
how profoundly an encounter can affect not only the person but the animals as
well what a wild case that is to me the most interesting aspect of that case is
the humanoid itself it's so unusual I don't know that I've ever heard anyone
else describe a humanoid with quite those details and it just goes to show
there is a wide wide variety of humanoid types seen but they're almost always
humanoid apparently we do share a common an ancestry this is what many contactees
have been told and this is certainly what the evidence is showing us and now moving along to the state of
Missouri a really interesting case of all the cases in this little collection
this one I think intrigues me the most I call this one a UFO landed in my
backyard this took place in early January of 1969 in Adena Missouri and it's quite an
unusual case involving a single witness though there are electromagnetic
effects but this UFO landed right in this lady's backyard and the description
of the occupant that she saw inside this UFO is also really interesting it was
the first or second week of January 1969 and adelene Davis aka Addie was not
sleeping very very well in her home on Lafayette Street as her daughter was feeling unwell and adelene was taking
care of her then suddenly for no reason that she could determine adelene bolted
upright in bed and looked out the window she didn't hear anything but she said
something woke her up and looking out her window she saw a strange craft had
landed in her backyard right outside of her window and inside of this craft
through a central window which was all lit up she saw a Strang looking figure
an occupant and it was looking right at her so all of this looked so strange to
her so absolutely unbelievable she literally could not believe her eyes and
seriously considered that she might be dreaming to determine whether she was dreaming she pinched herself she HIIT
herself she jumped up and down she actually ran into the bathroom and splashed her face with water to
determine that she was in fact truly awake and of course she was and
returning to the bedroom to look out the window no surprise the craft was still there and this strange entity inside of
it and it was only 6 ft away she described this craft in detail
as you can see from this drawing the object was shaped like two deep bowls
placed rim to rim with a rectangular midsection composed of three
Windows she said the craft was army green with a rough metallic finish it
rested on three sort of rust colored Landing legs the windows themselves were
tinted blue there were two red lights on either side and a white beam of Light
which came out of the bottom strangely this beam of light Shone straight down
and then made this impossible right degree turn so clearly not a normal beam
of light but strangest of all was this UFO occupant he was male he looked
mostly human though according to adelene his eyes were slanted and widespread and
his pupils had this weird sort of quote fuzzy or indefinite aspect to them she saw no
hair but does say that he was wearing what looked like an army cap a dark
jacket with a small upright collar with scalloped edges and what looked like a
scarf now when she first saw him he was looking down into the craft and seemed
to be working on something below the window then suddenly he raised his head
stared directly at adelene and his mouth dropped open with an obvious look of
surprise he stared at her for just a brief moment then looked back down and
continued doing whatever it was he had been doing he then reached up and looked
again at adelene and it was at that moment that this craft began to back
slowly away from the house about 10 ft stopped turned slightly adelene was
still in a State of Shock and disbelief she rushed back to the bathroom splashed
more water on her face and returned to the bedroom window the object was of
course still there though now it hovered about 3 to 5 ft off the ground and this
is when she could really see this weird beam of light that made a right degree turn then slowly this craft moved off
around the house and was gone so badly shook up adelene went into
the living room to smoke a cigarette and calm down and this is when she noticed that the furnace fan which runs
constantly was now not running but within a minute or two it started up
again so she figured that there must have been a power failure and later checking the clocks in the house she saw
that all of them were running about 20 minutes slow so this showed that there
had been a power Interruption while the object was there and that the encounter
in totality had lasted about 20 minutes strangely she says she felt no
fear during the encounter though the next day she felt very nervous for the
entire day now she did ask the neighbors they didn't see anything nor did they report
any power failure but she did report her case and this is how it came to be
investigated by UFO researchers I think you'll agree that's a super interesting case the description
of the UFO craft itself the description of this human looking ET mostly human I
honestly wonder if this could have been one of ours and yet here's this thing
Landing right in somebody's backyard if this is truly a US military test craft
why would it do it and this ET seemed very surprised to be observed assuming
this is an ET and if this was actually a human um
probably he wouldn't be so surprised given the fact that this craft landed right next to somebody's bedroom window
it's certainly a fascinating case on a number of different levels and now we move to the next case
this one is super unusual probably one of the most unusual cases in this whole
collection though I have to say I think they're all unusual this one is off the charts weird I call this one sucked
through the window this case took place on April 2nd
1971 in Green Hill Australia and uh some
very interesting aspects to it it is mostly a single witness case in terms of
seeing a humanoid but the are there are
corroborating Witnesses who saw UFOs in the area at the time uh this does
involve the husband of a couple and his wife did see part of the experience take
place as well so it was investigated to
by that it I think means it's pretty well
corroborated and certainly seems to be an absolutely genuine case with some
physical evidence and just super strange as we shall see this very strange event
occurred to a husband and wife in their home in greenh Hill this is in New South Wales
Australia they do want to remain anonymous though they did submit to a
thorough investigation by researchers and it was around 10 p.m. on April 2nd
1971 when the husband who is of Aboriginal descent went into the kitchen
to get a glass of water and looking up through the kitchen window he was
shocked to see a strange round face looking through the window back at him
so he could see that this was not normal the head was bald but he really didn't get a chance to look more closely
because the next thing he knew he was being lifted up and sucked directly
through the window which shattered he blacked out for just a second and found
himself falling down at the bottom of the outside steps on his back now unknown to him at the time time
his wife actually watched at least part of this happen as he was being sucked
through the window she heard the sound of the window breaking she thought her
husband had perhaps dropped some dishes so she rushed into the kitchen and she
saw her husband floating in a horizontal position through the window which was
now of course Broken he was several feet above the floor in a position that would
be impossible to do by jumping on his own all she could see was the lower half
of his body and she says that he was not quote struggling or thrashing about at
all just going through like that straight out and she describes this whole event
in detail to researchers as the wife says we came home from The Neighbors at
about 10:00 after watching television my husband went to bed and was playing with
the baby he got up and went into the kitchen to have a drink of water he didn't turn on the light but he said
afterwards he tipped his head back and saw this little face pressed against the window it had no hair and it looked like
a small saucer it had features but he did not describe them he doesn't
remember much about going through the window he says he was sucked out by some
Force he fell out at the bottom of the steps on his back I ran outside I
thought he would be stunned but he wasn't he wasn't even winded he jumped
up and ran like hell down to the gravel I ran after him and he was crying and
shaking I thought he had the horrors and I told him so I went back to the house
and he told me not to leave him there he was so
frightened now this guy did not really want to give a formal interview but he
told his wife you think I'm mad I'm not I saw something I saw something and his
wife says I know he saw something he's not superstitious he doesn't believe in
ghosts or men from space he does now but he was so shaken up by this and
slightly injured as well they ended up going to the hospital where the husband was given a stitch to close a wound on
his finger finger and they are both mystified about what happened this
window he went through was only 32 in wide and 10 in deep he touched nothing
on the sink in in front of him and he actually fell down more than 7 ft to the
bottom of the steps which is quite a distance so while this husband did have
a clear recollection of the incident that night get this the next morning
when he woke up he told his wife that he he needed to go fix the neighbor's window because he remembered putting his
fist through it he thought this was how he had hurt his finger and she had to
tell him that no the neighbor's window was fine and that he had actually cut his finger by being pulled through the
kitchen window now he had no memory of this at this point now later
investigators discovered that several people had reported strange light in that exact area on that night it was a
few hours before the incident Ena Murphy and her family who lived on Gabriel
Avenue they saw a bright red purple light descend near the hospital near
their home at the same time Arnold Nelson of
Taylor Street he saw the same light over M over the mcle
river another couple the Andrews were driving over the Bloomfield Street Street bridge when they saw apparently
the same light and there are more witnesses finally Mrs Richard blight and her
children who live on Ronald wixtead Avenue also saw apparently this same
strange light and all of the witnesses when interviewed said that this light was brilliant beautiful and clearly
strange what a bizarre case that is uh it does not appear that this man was
actually taken on board so perhaps this was a foiled onboard UFO encounter and
had he not been Disturbed he would have been taken on board in any event it's
super interesting that he was sucked through this window and the window actually broke it's also interesting
that so many people in that exact area saw apparently the same object so
clearly something very unusual happened on that night now we move to the next case
this one also got quite a bit of attention don't know if you've heard of it before but it definitely deserves to
be well known I call this one the humanoid on thre Mile Lake Road and I
really feel for the witness in this case because the aftermath of this encounter was almost as traumatic as the encounter
itself this one took place on October 9 1975 in uton this is in Ontario Canada
and while it is a single witness case there's some really interesting aspects
to it as we shall see back in 1965 Robert a Suffern a carpenter
married with two young boys saw a UFO over his barn in uon Ontario Canada now
this was just a simple sighting and over the next few years he had several other
sightings of anomalous lights at least three other sightings but these in no way prepared him for a
very dramatic encounter 10 years later with a landed UFO and humanoid and of
course the aftermath which followed it All Began on the evening of October 9
1975 when his sister Shirley who lived next door called him to say that it
looked like his barn was on fire so Robert looked outside and he didn't see
anything but he did did hear that his cattle were acting up so he asked his
Shirley to come over his he asked his sister Shirley to come over and watch
his young child and Robert took his car to go
investigate so he drove down threemile Lake Road and making a turn onto a side
road drove directly into the strangest experience of his life because right
before him sitting in the center of the road right ahead of him was a strange metallic craft as Robert says in his own
words and I quote I saw the ship in the center of the road it was the color of
the dull side of aluminum foil wrap and the surface was irregular and crinkled I
could not hear any sound other than the motor of my car I only saw it
momentarily and then it went straight up at a fast speed and disappeared there
were no lights there was no dust no apparent thrust nothing it went straight
up and over the trees so Robert estimates that this craft was about 12 to 14 ft in diameter
9 ft High circular in shape and as Robert says there was a black strip
running around the circumference and what looked to be a small platform on the bottom of the vehicle I was scared
it was right there in front of me with no lights and no sign of life I really hadn't come to a full stop when it went
straight up in the air and out of my sight so at this point Robert thought
his encounter was over but the most interesting part was yet to come because
he saw a humanoid and in fact he nearly ran over this UFO occupant with his car
and I'll just let Robert describe it in his own words as Robert says I turned around and started for
home turned onto the three M Lake Road and then I saw the thing on the side of
the road he was on the grass shoulder of the road and was about to cross from my
right to my left it suddenly pivoted and turned towards the pasture and vaulted
over the fence and out of sight it appeared to be short and had very broad
shoulders which seemed to be out of proportion the movements were similar to
an ape or a but it was very agile it reached up with its hands grabbed the
fence poost and vaulted over with no effort it was like he was
weightless the head portion was covered in a globe and I could not detect any
mask or face portion the suit was a silver color and
one piece the globe was a contrasting white or light color
so this figure was so close that Robert Robert had to slam on his brakes to
avoid hitting the creature so he actually skitted and this creature was about four to 5T tall his car skitted to
a stop and by that time this being was only about 10 maybe 15 ft from his
car so after it ran off he returned home he told his sister what happened he put
the kids to bed and he he was watching TV when suddenly the sound stopped the
screen blacked out he went outside to see if anything was going on and sure
enough he saw an orange glowing object behind his barn and it was moving off
following the Contour of the terrain and it moved out over threemile Lake
nearby so this entire encounter left him very badly shaken he spoke with
investigators and reporters and as Robert says in his own words it's
all right to think what you would do if you came face to face with a situation like this but when it actually happens
you are scared because you are dealing with the unknown I mean what do you do
if they come to the door offer them a beer Robert of course did tell his wife
what happened both of them were somewhat alarmed did not sleep well that night in
fact as his wife says we didn't get any sleep at all we were just too
scared so Robert at first intended to keep this secret but finally he decided
it was important to tell the police and as Robert says we figured that the
police wouldn't tell anyone they would just make a report and pass it along to
somebody but that didn't happen and in fact an officer shared the story with a
local radio station and this story immediately went viral the phone began
ringing off the hook at Robert's home investigators reporters and curiosity
Seekers converged and before long people were actually lining up to see the
encounter site to get Robert's autograph to hear his story firsthand and Robert and his wife both
began to regret going public and at one point I mean this was non-stop became a
circus two men Robert says drove up to his house and actually threatened he and
his family if he continued to talk to investigators Robert wasn't having it he
immediately kicked them off of his property but the aftermath of all of this went on and on at school his older
child was ridiculed by other students even as late as two years following this
encounter so the aftermath was very traumatic and as Robert's wife said this
is incredible I kind of wish we hadn't phoned the police maybe we had better
pack our things our neighbors probably think we're crazy now and we have no
quiet here boy I hope this ends soon I need some sleep no saucers just
sleep Robert is sticking by his story as he says I know what I saw and seeing is
believing but I don't care whether I ever see that creature again he went his
way and I went mine I don't know why he landed there so ultimately he regretted going
public because the aftermath was worse than the encounter itself and in fact
the publicity got so bad he had to disconnect his phone and he refused any
further interviews and as Robert says I regret I reported what I saw because it
is affecting my family life and my work we have had to leave the house to eat
properly it is just not worth the hassle if it happened all over again I would
never tell anybody but he did and boy did this have
repercussions because it was one month following the encounter that Robert says
he and his wife were contacted by high ranking military officials from both the
Canadian and the US government they they verified their identity they arrived in full uniform
with credentials that show that they were in fact from the Canada air force
the US Air Force the Pentagon and the US Office of Naval
intelligence the men requested that the Sufferin undergo a full physical exam
which they agreed to do they were also questioned in depth about their experience and these government
officials answered all their questions as well in fact they said that these government officials showed them genuine
photographs of UFOs and said that the governments were cooperating with the
ETS and said and this is strange that the Suffern sighting was the result of a
malfunctioning ET craft how they would know that I don't know but it's
certainly an interesting aspect to this case there's a lot to learn from that case I like the fact that this was a
humanoid of a kind we don't normally hear a lot about it shows how an
encounter can profoundly affect a person the fact that this person was visited by
government officials who are very curious about his encounter shows that this is a phenomena that is in fact
being taken very seriously by our governments despite all the government
denials that have been going on for decades es and let's face it are still
going on yes we have recent steps towards disclosure but it hasn't happened yet there still is a UFO cover
up and in my mind until we see the Roswell craft and the bodies in the museum open for public examination the
cover up is still in place and now we move to the next case
which I call the crack neck creature this is a very unusual case which took
took place on October 10 1976 at cracknet crack neck Lookout in
New South Wales and it's an extraordinary case involving many many witnesses and a very
very unusual humanoid this case was investigated by Bill Chalker a very
well-known researcher from Australia it was on October 10
1976 that an anonymous woman was driving along the highway about 4 miles from the
crack neck Lookout in New South Wales Australia she was actually in a line of
cars on the road two cars were in front of her and one was behind suddenly the
car behind her accelerated and pass her and the two other cars in front of her
and sped off at high speed and it was just a few seconds later that this woman noticed that the
two cars in front of her also so suddenly for no reason that she could see accelerated away at very high speed
so something was going on puzzled and wondering why these other drivers sped
off so quickly this woman looked out her right window and was shocked to see a dissh
shaped object with a dome on top about 75 ft up directly over her car pacing it
exactly so frightened as a apparently the other drivers had been she quickly
accelerated and sped away she reached the town ahead of her shortly later and actually saw one of
the cars that she had been driving with pulled over with two men outside of it talking and looking back down the road
where they had just come from so she also pulled over and looked and sure enough this object was still hovering
low over the road where they had first seen it this poor witness was so sh shaken up
up she couldn't drive anymore she called her husband to come pick her up as she was too frightened to drive
home but this encounter wasn't over yet was at about 8:00 p.m. that evening that
two young couples we only know them by their first names Tony and Linda and
Nigel and Mandy had pulled over at the crack neck Lookout which overlooks the
coast and it was Linda who was surprised to see what looked like a strange orange
light floating on the water's surface just off the coast but she didn't think
too much of it until about 15 minutes later at 8:15 when the two men decided to look
over the Cliff's Edge and that's when they got the shock of their life and
I'll just quote one of the men directly Tony as he says in his own words we heard some noises down there we
walked down and heard the noises we went up a bit further and heard more noises like grass rustling and shuffling so we
walked up to a little clearing on the side of the cliff and looked down and we saw this thing crawling up the hill it
was an all offwhite color we ran all the way back to the car and got inside I was
shaking like anything we locked all the doors we said to the two girls we saw
something down there and they started to believe us then all of a sudden we saw this thing coming up
through the trees Nigel saw it first he said to the rest of us that he saw it we
all looked down there and Mandy in front started to just scream I saw it from the knees to the
head all off white and its face its eyes were just like fly's eyes and its mouth
was just only round I could distinctly see it had three
joints in its arms its legs were huge its shoulders were about 36 in across
its fingers were pointed it seemed to approach the car momentarily and looked
away when the car lights came on Nigel then reversed the car as quickly as possible and drove off the creature also
had no hair whatsoever so this being whatever it was
was very tall they said it was somewhere between eight and nine feet tall again shoulders at least 3 ft wide and as it
turned out later numerous people at this same crack neck Lookout would report
seeing dark shapes in the area hearing footsteps strange anomalous lights at
the foot of the cliff and on or under the surface of the ocean a few reported
quote in invisible man sitting on the back of parked cars so there was some speculation that
there was a big foot around this area though the couple Tony and Linda and
Nigel and Mandy said that whatever this thing was it was hairless so perhaps not
a Bigfoot otherwise a very strange case apparently there's something about that
area that is attracting these ETS if that's what they are you UFOs I don't
know there's always more questions it seems like than answers when it comes to this
subject but definitely an important case and now we move to the last case of this
Bunch I'd be surprised if you heard about this one but it's certainly interesting given its location and I
call this one the aliens at Stonehenge this took place fairly
recently on November 18 1990 guess that's not that recent now
it's some 30 almost 35 years ago but still a modern case and took place of
course at Stonehenge in Salisbury in the UK it's a multiple witness case it's got
some very interesting physical effects to it it was thoroughly investigated by
researcher Albert button so it's an important case and really unusual that
it took place place in such a famous location this last case again was
investigated by Albert Buton and he writes this case must be one of the most
intriguing close encounter events of the past few years although it has had very
little p publicity and is virtually unknown so this encounter involves a
couple known only by their first names Dorne and Lee who at around 8:30 p.m. on
November 18 1990 were driving from Wales to London
and as they drove along the a344 highway approaching Stonehenge it was Dorne who first saw an
eerie orange glow emanating from a cops of trees and suddenly rising up from
these trees was a 10t wide orange sphere which rose 50 ft in the air almost
directly above them what's weird is this little Grove of trees did not look quite
normal it looked almost flattish and now here's this wide orange sphere Rising
above it so she turns to her boyfriend or husband Lee and asks him about it and
strangely he showed no interest and just dismissed it Dorne however was shocked
to see that this object whatever it was was now pacing their car on the right
side at this point Point both of them were very puzzled to come upon a band of fog they estimate about 2T wide
stretching across the road like a gate and as they drove through it something
very strange happened this weird Eerie silence and Stillness settled over them
what Jenny randles calls the Oz effect and as Dorne said It felt as if we were
the only two people left in the world strangely and we see in many other cases
there was no traffic which is odd because this is in fact Stonehenge which is usually
crowded they had now reached the Stonehenge Monument itself Dorne tried
to get Lee interested in the sphere but he was strangely unimpressed he did not
want to look at it though he did later say he had heard about UFO's disabling
cars and therefore purposefully left the engine running as they exited the car so
he did have the presence of mind to think that this might be a UFO they're dealing with but strangely and he can't
explain it himself he was more interested in watching the moon on the opposite side of where this UFO was
hovering so Dorne alone stared at this sphere which she estimates was about 60
ft away but it then began to do this kind of display darting to the side and
doing this series of of aerial maneuvers that absolutely astonished her she said
it darted horizontally across the field went straight up went sideways again
winked out and reappeared and Dove downwards she absolutely felt it was
quote her forming for her so she repeatedly implored Lee to turn around
and look but he strangely refused so finally to try to get him to
look she asked him to go into into the car and get the camera and this point
Lee suddenly screamed at her very scared to get into the car he was apparently
quite frightened and actually dove into the driver's seat she hopped in right behind him and he accelerated and
screeched away from this area they immediately hit another band
of fog just like the one they had entered as they exited this area and
Dorne looked and saw that this orange ball of light was still pacing
them finally a few miles later they stopped to compare notes about what
happened and Lee explained why he had gotten so frightened he said that while
he was looking at Stonehenge and the Moonlight shining down upon it he saw a
strange figure among the stones said it seemed to just appear he did not see it arrive it was just there but he became
really unnerved when this figure began to March towards him stomping heavily on
the ground he said it moved quite quickly faster than a normal person and
in fact as it approached the security fence surrounding the monument he saw that this was not a security guard as he
first thought instead it looked to him like this figure was 7 ft tall very
broad shoulders it was completely black and featureless from head to toe and it
had just to reach the fence and this is when Dorne called for the
camera so Lee says he had been actually kind of mesmerized by this figure's appearance but hearing Dorne call for
the camera he snapped out of it went into a panic and screamed at Lee to get
into the car and at this point he could see that this figure had somehow crossed over the
security fence he doesn't know how it did that and was still approaching and as he started of the car this figure
reached the back end of the car and as Lee put the car into gear he said it
actually came right up to the side of the car and that's when he accelerated
away now Dorne her attention had been completely consumed by watching this UFO
she never saw the figure and as Dorne says well Lee was telling me this
happened and I was telling him that happened and it was ridiculous
even though we had both been in the same situation it was as if we had not been there together at
all they also noticed something else very strange they had a fresh banana on
the dashboard of the car but it was now black overripe and oozing all over the
dashboard both of them felt that that was very unusual so they were talking all of this
over and they could still see this ball of light off in the distance and they decided to keep driving and
suddenly they hit full traffic and re this is when they realized that this area should have had
traffic during the encounter but did not and this is when Dorne says the high
strangeness of it all hit her like a ton of bricks she said it was very much like
waking up from a dream almost now in the days following the encounter they had some weird effects
they both noticed that objects around their house were being moved around kind of like a
poltergeist now Dorne says she did have a long history of paranormal events
including a prior UFO sighting quite close up and she had had a lot of paranormal
stuff so was not overly alarmed when she began having ESP but Lee who prior to
all of this was very skeptical of UFOs in the Paranormal he also began having ESP and
telepathy and this really upset him and freaked him out so they later decided to return to
the site to check it out and Dorne noticed something very strange she was
unable to locate this Grove of trees that she had seen the UFO emerge from
and this is when she remembered in hindsight that this Grove of trees had had a sort of strangely twodimensional
look to it so she ERS about that also during this experience she remembered
reaching over the security fence to touch Stonehenge the monument but now
she saw that this was actually impossible to do doe to the height of the fence she also remembered seeing
Hills when this encounter was going on but now looking at the area there were
no Hills so there was a lot of strange things going on with this encounter
which perhaps involved more more than just a sighting definitely appears to
have some screen memories or something going on here at any rate this was again
investigated by Albert Buon and he speculates that this encounter and
frankly most of the others he believes are caused by Earth lights and magnetic
fields and are essentially hallucinatory in nature this is just his theory but I
figured I'd mention it since this was a case that he personally investigated uh but certainly an
interesting multiple witness case with a lot of unique details to it a really
interesting case for sure I think what to me is so interesting about this is we
see some of these details where with the traffic being missing this unusual
unnatural Eerie Stillness the reactions following the encounter including what looks like a
sort of psychic Awakening this may have been more than just a simple sighting involving a UFO
in humanoids certainly possible hard to say for sure but absolutely an important
case so there you go 10 cases from all across the world involving people who
saw humanoids face to face half involving Landings a good number of es
there involving the range of evidence that we see again Landing
traces physical effects of various kinds medical effects animal reactions
electromagnetic disturbances all types of evidence surrounding these encounters
so Skeptics who say there's no evidence for this are simply not doing their homework there is evidence there are
multiple Witnesses and it's hard to explain these cases as anything other than what they appear to be
extraterrestrial visitations I know there are many different theories to account for these
kinds of experiences everything from interdimensional beings to Time Travelers and what have
you but I still feel like the evidence is best explained by the most popular
explanation which is extraterrestrial and this is certainly what most Witnesses and I think most recent
Searchers believe but there's always more questions to be answered and more things
to be figured out which I think it's why it's so important that we take a look at
these cases this is why I do this research so I hope you've enjoyed this episode and perhaps learned something I
truly appreciate you watching so thanks so much for that and until next time
keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all like
I always like to say keep having fun bye for
now
