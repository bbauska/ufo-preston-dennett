EXTRATERRESTRIAL RENDEZVOUS: FIVE AMAZING ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Dec 29, 2023

Summary:
Dec 29, 2023
Onboard a UFO! It’s the closest of all UFO encounters. It’s the most extensive, and perhaps the most interesting. It also contains the most information. In cases like these, the witness is not just seeing a UFO, they are inside it, surrounded entirely by the UFO phenomenon. Onboard UFO encounters allow little room for misperception. This video present five amazing onboard UFO experiences. In each of these cases, the witnesses were not only taken inside a UFO, they had long interactive conversations with the ETs themselves. These five cases come from all over the world, span four decades and involve a wide variety of humanoids and compelling physical evidence.

A MESSAGE TO HUMANITY. On the night of Apr 10, 1962, Mario Zuccala was walking to his home in San Casciano, Italy when he felt a blast of air behind him. Turning around he saw a 32-foot-wide flying saucer land nearby. Out stepped two short humanoid figures covered from head to toe in shiny metallic suits. They grabbed Mario and pulled him onboard the craft. Inside, he saw nothing but bright light. The ETs told him that they have a message for all humanity, which they will give to him later. Mario later had further encounters, but never revealed what the ETs told him.

“WE ARE HERE TO HELP.” On the evening of Jun 23, 1967, Paulo Coutinho (age 17) was walking home from school in Aricanduva, Brazil when a glowing orb dropped fell the sky and landed in front of him. The orb dimmed to reveal a 3-foot-tall humanoid who pulled Paulo into the sky and up into a huge craft. Inside, Paulo was examined by ETs and held a long conversation. They told him that no harm would come to him, that they were visiting Earth to help, that God is real, that humanity needs to become peaceful before they can show themselves, and much more. Returned to his home, Paulo learned that he had been missing for 20 hours. Following the encounter, his stuttering problem disappeared. He also learned that his mother had seen a UFO on the day Paulo was born.

“YOU ARE PROGRESSING AS PLANNED.” At 11:45 pm on Feb 10, 1981, Kathy (a medical professional) was driving to her home in Renton, WA when a glowing craft appeared above her car. Alarmed, she drove the short distance to her apartment, only to find that the UFO had followed her home. She ran to her front door, only to discover that she had missing time. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard a craft and examined by gray aliens who told her that she was doing well, that they were pleased with how her father had taught her, and that they would meet again. She told her father what happened. He wept and told her that he had been taken three times by the same ETs.

“YOU ARE TOO OLD.” In the early morning hours of Aug 12, 1983, 77-year-old gardener, Alfred Burtoo set out for a fishing trip along the banks of a canal in Aldershot, England. To his shock, a UFO landed nearby, and out came two 4-foot-tall humanoids dressed in shiny green suits and helmets. They walked up to him and gestured for him to follow them onboard their craft. Inside, Alfred saw rounded walls, a central column, and a strange beam of light. They instructed him to stand under the light so they could examine him. Afterwards they turned to him and said, “You can go. You are too old and infirm for our purpose.” Mildly disappointed at being rejected by the ETs, Alfred exited the craft, which promptly took off. Alfred later called it the greatest experience of his life.

“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.” One night in the 1990s, Sharon Beals was in her home in the USA when she saw odd lights through the skylight. At the same time, her 2-year-old daughter, Kelly (who had been complaining of monsters and “sky monkeys” entering her room) came running in. Without warning, both woke up to realize that hours had passed. Sharon discovered that her eyeglasses were bent so badly, they were now useless. Knowing she had been taken again, she went under hypnosis and recalled being taken onboard a craft. Inside she saw gray ETs who told her that they were her friends, that she was safe, and did she want to help save the planet? Sharon saw her daughter and several other people onboard the craft before being transported through the ceiling of her home and into her bedroom.

These five cases are just a tiny fraction of the actual number of onboard encounters, and yet they provide an accurate representation of what it’s like to be taken into an alien craft and interact directly with extraterrestrials. They contain both unique elements and fascinating commonalities. They answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon, and also provide compelling evidence for UFO reality. They show how complex and bizarre UFO contact can be, and how it is both transformative and enlightening to those who have the experience. And most importantly, they make it very clear that humanity is not alone in this amazing and infinite universe.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal we've got a
really interesting episode for you today I certainly hope so I call this one
extraterrestrial rendevu five amazing onboard UFO encounters I love love love
the onboard UFO cases more than pretty much any other type of UFO encounter
particularly because these are the closest of all UFO encounters these are
the most extensive cases these are the cases that I think are certainly the most interesting and contain the most
information about ETS and what it's like to have extraterrestrial contact and
I've chosen five cases that in particular are super interesting because
the Witnesses were able to have interactive conversations with the
extraterrestrials so we learn quite a bit about the ET in these particular
cases these cases also cover a pretty significant period of time for decades
from the 60s all the way up through the 1990s and again come from all over the
world giving us a cross cultural perspective so I have a case from
England I have a case from Italy one from Brazil and South America and two
from the United States these are all single witness cases however pretty much
all of them or certainly most of them do have what I would call supporting
Witnesses or evidence in terms of other people seeing UFO activity in that area
at that time and of course there's other types of evidence such as Landing traces
physiological effects and these sort of things animal reactions and so forth so
yeah some really interesting cases most of these I think you probably haven't
heard of before there is one that's quite well known did get a lot of attention but I think it's so
interesting that if you haven't heard about it you certainly should have so
let's just get started because yeah these are extensive cases and the first one I'd like to talk about is probably
the briefest of all five of these but still pretty interesting and I call this
one a message to Humanity this occurred on April 10
1962 in San casano Italy it's a super
interesting if somewhat controversial case involving an Italian
tailor primary witness in this case is Mario zuka he's a 27-year-old tayor
married with four children and on the evening of April 10
1962 he had just got gotten off the bus and was returning to his home from his
place of employment and he was walking around the local Cemetery in San casano
Italy when he says he was struck from behind by an abnormally powerful gust of
air he says it was almost powerful enough to lift him off his feet and
turning around to see what was the cause he was paralyzed with fear he said to
see a 32t wide white white metallic Flying Saucer hovering only a few feet
off the ground it wasn't quite landed it was hovering just a few feet off off the
ground and he says he was unable to move and watched in shock as the sort of
metallic cylinder about 3 feet wide came out from the bottom of the object and
descended kind of telescoping to the ground and at this point a door or an
opening appeared in the cylinder and emitted an intense white light he says
two small men quote about 4 4 and 1/2 ft tall came out and stepped down a few
steps and approached Mario he said that they were pretty much humanoid in form
but were completely covered by an armor of shining metal they had a strange Hood
over their head with what looked like two antenna like devices on either side
and were wearing gloves he could not see their faces now Mario said at this point his
fear completely left him and instead he felt a quote absolute
Tranquility says the ETS walked right up to him grabbed him by his armpits and
lifted him bodily off the ground and took him inside the craft now he doesn't
have a whole lot of memory of what the inside of the craft look like other than
it was a very bright light he saw no source of the light but it was there was
not a whole lot in there he said so he asked them where they came from and they
did not reply but he says at this point he heard a loud voice he said it sounded
almost like it was coming from a loud speaker kind of metallic sounding echoing and coming from one of the
beings telling him in his native language of Italian quote at the end of
the fourth Moon about 1 hour from morning we will return to give a message
to humanity we shall give notice of this to another person in order to confirm
that that which you have seen is true so it's a pretty brief message
there and the next thing Mario knew he was being escorted out of the object and
he doesn't know how but he found himself standing in in front of the door to his home with no idea how he got there his
wife Francis found him there saying that she heard four knocks on the door now
Mario does not remember knocking on the front door but she opened the door found
him there saw that he was terrified and Mario was quite traumatized he said he was unable to
sleep that night he was not planning on talking about this to anybody but he did
tell it to a friend who called the newspaper so this led to an
investigation uh there were no Landing traces found at the site however Mario
said that he was contacted later and was given half of this supposed message
which he said he kept in a lock a locked case unrevealed he said the second half
of the message ETS told him had been given to to someone else in Europe and
apparently according to him they showed him the face of this person so he would recognize them and this is pretty much
where the case stands it was investigated by a gentleman by the name
of let me see if I can get this right cerelli silano who said of Mario and I
quote he speaks with a calm Assurance of what he has seen now there are some who skeptical of
his account but those who know him say he is an honest and sincere man and in
fact there is some interesting corroboration to his case because there was another case not too far away which
occurred on that same evening it involved four gentlemen iller
Bazi and three others who were driving along the Sano legano Road and they
stopped their car to view this unusual glowing object in the sky and as they
watched it they could see this wasn't a plane or helicopter or anything it was totally silent it had three white lights
on it and as they're watching it it Dove down towards their car and then landed
on the road in front of them before taking off they were not going to tell
anyone about this until they heard about Mario's encounter in the
newspapers and this is when they told the police so certainly some interesting
corroboration there though not really evidence or proof of Mario's encounter
again Mario would report other encounters and some Italian ethologists began to question the legitimacy of some
of his claims but it's certainly an interesting experience and Mario has
stuck to his story to the day he died while there are those who do remain
skeptical of Mario's account I I don't know uh a lot of the details he
describes are certainly ones we hear quite often and by all accounts from the
people who know him he is an honest and sincere gentleman so you can just make
up your own mind about it the case was cited in a few books and is certainly
worth knowing and here's another case which is also super super interesting very
extensive has a lot of information and I call this one we are here to help this
got a lot of attention in the area where it occurred Brazil it occurred on June
23rd 1976 in the town of eranda this is in sa
Paulo Brazil and it's amazing it's an amazing case because it involves quite a bit of
evidence uh some really unusual features and just some really
interesting takeaways from it so this amazing extensive and very well verified
and investigated case does involve again multiple corroborating
Witnesses but the primary witness is Paulo coutinho and it was around 11:30
p.m. June 23rd 1976 Paulo had just left his
girlfriend's house after attending school with her and was walking home so
as he walked along the sidewalk of Moises Marx Street in front of the
church of sa Pedro he saw a strange light moving overhead and away from him
but it was unusual so he stopped to watch it when suddenly It reversed its trajectory and zoomed towards him and
this is when he realized that this light appeared to be targeting him and he he became afraid he turned to run but found
himself unable to move and in about 2 seconds the light dropped down to the
sidewalk about 18 ft away from him quite close he could now see it was a small
luminous sphere it slowly dimmed in brilliance and in its place was a small
dwarf-like humanoid about 3T tall Pao gave a very Vivid description
he said that this figure had an enormous bald head large Blue Eyes an upturned
nose a very small mouth white pale skin and the figure was wearing a smooth blue
gay jumpsuit with a strange emblem on its chest now for the next two or three
minutes Paulo and this humanoid faced each other and then Paulo found himself
walking right up to the the humanoid and the next thing he knows both he and this
little man rise slowly up into the air he says it took about 10 to 15 seconds
for them to reach a height of about 90 ft and then both shot up at a dizzying
pace very fast and Paulo looked down and watched the Earth recede until it was
just a small globe and in front of him hanging in space he saw this huge
sparkling red cigar-shaped object he estimates it was about 700 maybe 800 ft
long and he's not sure how but somehow he and this humanoid were drawn inside
the craft into a small room about 9 ft wide square square-ish with light gray
walls that curved into the floor and ceiling Paulo was lying on the floor
there were two other humanoids in there looking pretty much the same as the first what's really interesting is while
this room was 9 ft wide it was only 4T High Paulo was 5' 7 in tall so he was
unable to stand up in this room this point he's wondering what's happening to him is he hallucinating Dreaming or
imagining all this so he reached out to touch one of the ETS at which point he
found himself absolutely unable to move and one of the ET spoke telepathically
to him saying we are not going to do anything to you so don't try to do
anything against us and then one of the ETS said follow
us two of these little kind of typical Grays walked ahead and one walked on his
right Paulo found himself able to move but unable to stand up he kind of hobbled on his knees towards the wall
where a mysterious opening appeared and they walked into another room again with
a 4ft tall ceiling but much bigger about 30 ft wide again with curved walls
inside there were six more humanoids so now there's a total of nine of them also
in the room was a table he kind of walked up or you know hobbled on his
knees up to the table until one of the humanoids told him to just remain where he
was so at this point Paulo knows he's awake he knows this is really happening
he felt considerable fear he could feel the sweat pouring off his body but he
did get a good look at the ETS you could see that they were basically humanoid
they had five fingers small pointed ears some appeared to have more delicate
features and he had the impression that they were female and the others male he
saw that they had large shoes silver with kind of thick Souls on them so he's
freaking out at this point he's thinking about his girlfriend and how she was the last person to see him when to his
surprise the wall before him kind of lit up like a TV screen only it was in three
dimensions it looked absolutely real and he could see an image of his girlfriend
walking down the street the scene shifted and he saw two classmates from
school on their motorcycles so Paulo was looking at all this
pensively with some sadness he thought of his parents you know would they ever see him again and the image changed to
show his mother and father inside their home now his mother was crying his
father looked quite worried so Paulo's getting a little bit angry at this point
he's feel like he's being taken away from his family and those he loved and he spoke out loud to the ETS what do you
want with me now the ETS did not speak out loud they replied telepathically and
one of them said don't worry we won't hurt you Paulo
asked what do you come to do here on Earth and the ET replied we are studying
how life arose on the planets and in the universe we are also here to
help so this intrigued Paulo and some of his fear lessened and he started asking
them questions he asked them does God exist and the ET replied yes though Pao
had the impression that he wasn't sure if the ET fully understood the question
but next they showed him this 3D image of the docking of the Russian and American in space which by coincidence
or not Paulo had previously seen in school Paulo did ask them then what they
thought thought of Earth's technology and the ET replied and I quote if all
countries on the planet joined their efforts in common the result would have
a much greater scope so this is a message of Peace which I found very
interesting Paulo asked to see the earth and the image on the screen shifted immediately to show the Earth First
quite close up and then receding quickly Paulo asked them if they ever
used robot robots or robotic technology and the ETS replied no but that each of
them meaning the ETS were specifically prepared to do the tasks that they were
now doing so Paulo asked them a very interesting question again out loud he
said why don't the aliens descend on mass on earth and the ETS gave a very
interesting response they said that as long as the people of Earth remained
divided such an action would provoke War they would only land when the people of
Earth joined together they did tell him that there were millions of other planets with life
out in the universe which they were currently researching and visiting and at one point they showed him what looked
like a star map now at this point one of the female ETS walked up to the wall it opened up
and let her out Paulo could see a corridor lit with red light but this opening closed again she
returned moments later with another ET and Pao was then instructed to follow
this ET who had just entered the room into the previous room which he had just exited so he followed three of the ETS
into this room and in it he saw that there was sort of a stretcher floating
right above the floor and Paulo's body floated right onto the the stretcher and
this new ET was apparently a doctor because he began to run his hands above
Paulo's body as if examining him this is what Paulo thought was happening so he
asked and he was told that this new ET was in fact a doctor and that they were
examining him Paulo asked if they were going to do any type of surgery on him
and they said no that they did not need to open his body that they could do whatever they needed to do without
resorting to those measures the next thing he knows he's floating off of this table and he feels
the strong crushing pressure enveloping his entire body and boom he found
himself outside the craft with the same humanoid who had brought him in he
became very dizzy his vision blurred felt a bit nauseous and then saw a
whirlwind of lights and blacked out so meanwhile back on Earth the next
morning has arrived and Paulo is not there however one of Paulo's fellow
students found his notebooks his school notebooks on the ground apparently
exactly where he had been taken on board so this student took these notebooks and
returned it to Paul's home and this is when Paulo's parents realized that their
son was missing under very mysterious circumstances and throughout the day
family and friends gathered at the house and they were wondering where he was and
what was going on and when evening arrived Paulo's father Jose got a
telepathic message he felt a sudden very strong conviction that his son was all
right and would be returning shortly and it was shortly later that one of the members of the household heard a
groaning coming from outside they rushed outside and there was Paulo groaning
lying on the ground cold semiconscious Paulo has no memory of this really uh
next thing he remembers is basically waking up in the hospital it was the next day June 24th
and Paulo had been missing for 20 hours he was rushed to the emergency
room at tutap and he was traumatized but physically found
he did notice that following this encounter in the days and weeks afterwards he started to hear a strange
ringing and buzzing noise in his head he wondered if it might be a type of mental
communication with the ETS there were other changes before his encounter he was a somewhat nervous
person he suffered from stuttering but following this encounter he says he had
a much calmer outlook on life and his stuttering disappeared
during his onboard encounter Paula did have a mechanical pen and pencil in his
pocket these were tested by researchers and were shown to be magnetized but weirdly his watch which
he was also wearing showed no other abnormality other than being 20 hours
behind so investigators really dug into this case interviewed him thoroughly
interviewed other people in the area and found out out that several people had seen a UFO on that night some reported
weird disturbances on their TV sets and in the months following the
encounter Paulo's family saw UFOs overhead now here is another very
interesting fact Maria coutinho Paulo's mother said that on the day that Paulo
was born she actually saw a metallic sphere flying in the sky which was also
observed by Paulo's older brother then 8 years old so this I think is an
indication that Paulo's encounter was not a one-off and they had likely been
followed pretty much his entire life a truly fascinating Case by any account
and it's really interesting because the ETS did talk about why they're here on this planet
and gave the the witness quite a bit of information certainly deserves to be
well known and that's why I wanted to cover it in this episode and now we move to another case which I doubt you've
heard of it's not very well known at all I call this one you are progressing as
planned and this is an interesting case for a number of reasons because it shows
how closely ETS are observing and working with certain people this one
occurred on February 10 1981 in Ron Washington this is a typical
missing time encounter which was uncovered through hypnotic regression but the what the witness
recalled certainly matches what other people are remembering fully consciously
I think it's a legitimate case and I hope you find it interesting again the
witness in this case has requested full anonymity and is known only as Kathy I
believe that it's a pseudonym at any rate she at the time of her encounter
was a 25-year-old Medical Professional and a college
graduate but she revealed her story to reporter Doug margeson of the Auburn
Washington Globe News because she felt that she was not alone with her
experiences and wanted others who might be afraid to know that they are not alone with their experiences and it was
around 11:40 p.m. on February 10 1981 and Kathy was driving along the
petritsky road again this is in Renton Washington and she had just passed the
Valley General Hospital she was at the intersection of 151st and petritsky
pictured here and she looked up in the sky and saw this weird ring of red and
blue lights flashing in this sort of sequence and looking up at this she
could see that whatever this was was about 75 to 100 feet in diameter and
very low hovering just above a Grove of trees so she was nearly home at this
point she turned left on1st and drove just a short distance to
her apartment building and parked she looked around for the UFO and saw that
it was now hovering about 150 ft off the ground of about 200 ft away apparently
following her to her home and she thought to herself if this moves or
drops I'm getting out of here and of course the object did drop in a sort of
Falling Leaf motion down to an altitude of about 20 to maybe 50 ft it then
stopped and came zooming right for her this freaked her out she ran out of the
car leaving the headlights still on and ran for her front door now turning around she saw that she
had left her headlights on and for some strange reason she felt compelled to go back into the car get in and turn off
the headlights which she did and she was G got out ran for her door which was
about 75 ft away and when she looked up the UFO was gone she thought this was
strange cuz she didn't see it leave and after thinking about it she wondered if
there was more to this encounter than she remembered so she did her research and
the next day she contacted eileene Gat of the UFO contact center
International and after interviewing her eileene agreed with Kathy and suspected
that she may have had missing time and eileene suggested
hypnosis eileene did the hypnosis Kathy agreed and had four hypnotic sessions
which did of course reveal that she had been taken on board Kathy recalled that
after she sat down in her car to turn off the headlights the car suddenly
filled with bright white light and the next thing she knew without knowing how
she got there she was standing inside a dome likee room 15 ft wide she said the
walls were very smooth very white she saw an arched doorway in front of her in
the room there was sort of this white box which held a dark screen which had a bunch of colored lights on it she also
saw a long white table which was connected to the floor by a single
pedestal this was right behind her and she didn't feel any real fear she said
she felt quote calm but kind of bewildered and she was surprised to find
herself undressing at which point two beings came through the arch door and
she described them she said they were about 4 and 1/2 to 5T tall with thin
upper bodies sloping shoulders and long arms that came down almost to their
knees they had large kind of light bulb-shaped heads very large wide eyes
just a small Ridge for a nose a slit for a mouth and a tiny flap and a hole for
ears ears she did notice that they had only four fingers very long fingers on
each hand their skin was gray white kind of cool to the touch she said and they
were dressed from the neck down in quote a Blu spray metallic
fabric she also noticed that on the left chest of their uniforms was an Insignia
that looked to her like an aases triangle inside a white circle so these
appear to be the typical Gray they held her by her upper arms and led
her to this table and as Kathy says the whole thing seemed to go like clockwork
I got on the table and they gently pushed me down I wasn't frightened I had
no real thoughts now at this point she did see a third humanoid and he was much the same
as the other two but wore a red orange uniform with a black stripe around the
neck he and the other two beings surrounded the table and the one in the red orange
uniform she says held a silver instrument that looked a little bit like
a mallet he placed it on her abdomen in a few spots and he would look down
through the other end apparently examining her he left for a moment and
then returned and Kathy spoke to them she asked them mentally what is the
purpose of this and the ET replied you are progressing physically and
mentally as planned and are very receptive to us they told her that they
were pleased with what her father had taught her and that it was now time to go and as Kathy says in her own words I
didn't want to but they assisted me off the table I put my dress on they said
you will see us again and the next thing I knew I was back in my
car so after all the sessions were complete Kathy remembered that she and
her father used to watch UFOs in the sky when she was just a little girl she
decided she was going to call her father and share what happened to her and she
did and she was amazed by his reaction as she says he cried he never told me
before but he has had four encounters with the same people so this is a fairly
typical case and it shows the very commonly reported physical exam by the ETS it also shows that contact is often
generational Kathy doesn't know why she was chosen but she knows that many people still remain very skeptical of
such accounts but she says she's confident in what happened to her and what she remembered and as she says
think what you want I believe it the fact that this witness insisted upon on
anonymity um is not looking for any attention whatsoever I think argues
towards the credibility of the case and again it matches what so many other
people have said it's a really fascinating case and so is this next one
I think of all the cases I'm presenting today this might be the most fascinating
it's certainly the most wellknown if you haven't heard of it you definitely should know about it because it's a
fantastic case I call this one you are too old this occurred on August 12th
1983 in England near Aldershot England and it involves a gentleman who
is 77 years old and had an onboard experience unlike any other I've
actually heard about though in many ways it is a fairly typical encounter in some
ways it's absolutely unique and I think you'll find it quite fascinating it was
around 1 a.m. and Alfred beru a retired Gardener age
77 sat with his dog tiny on the banks of a canal near Aldershot
England again this is August 12 1983 Alfred was getting his fishing pole
and bait ready for an early morning of fishing and he was just pouring a cup of
tea when a UFO show up and I'll just quote Alfred because he described what
happened next in very Vivid detail as Alfred says in his own
words I saw a light suddenly appear from the south so I put my cup down on the
box and stood and watched it it came in towards the Railway Bridge and I thought
it's not going to land on the Railway Bridge I straight away guessed that it wasn't an airplane or a chopper because
it was only only about 300 ft off the ground then it settled down further
along the toe path and the brilliant light that had been showing was
extinguished I stood there watching it and presently I saw two forms coming
towards me the dog growled and wouldn't pack up until I told it to two forms
came up to me just over 4T high I would say dressed in green overalls and visors
I stood there looking at them and they stood there looking at me I got a bit of a shock when they came up to me with
those green overalls on I couldn't see any buttons or Zips or anything it was
just as though it was molded onto them the dog sat there quietly after I told
it to shut up they had like pea green helmets on their heads but the visor on
front seemed to be blacked out like smoked glass you couldn't see their faces I didn't notice their hands maybe
they had gloves on but then the chap on the right waved for me to come and that
was all I was curious so I followed them well when we got down to within 50 to 60
yards of the Railway Bridge there was this object sitting on the toe path 10
to 15 ft over the water and 10 to 15 ft over the bank the outside was like
polished aluminum there were steps they were offline to the toe path and we had to
step onto the grass to go up to them they were just a wide set of steps with
a handrail up both sides so at this point the ETS climb up
the steps Alfred follows Alfred did notice that as they walked up to this craft the ETS did seem a bit stiff in
their movements and they led him up to and into this craft which he said was about 45 ft wide it had sort of a top
Dome Port holes around the center six or seven that he could
see and of course there were about 5 to 10 steps leading up to a height he
estimates of about 12 to 15 ft and as Alfred says in his own words one went
ahead of me because that is the way they walked down the path and one behind me
one of these Farms went across the corridor which was
hex one of these forms went across the corridor which was hexagon in shape and
the other one stood near the door I stood to the right of him so he stood
there quite some time as if they were preparing for something and as Alfred says the one in front of me walked
across what I would call the corridor into what I took to be a room on the other side and the other one just stood
inside the door and I stood to the right of him so again he's standing right there for
quite some time he said it was warmer inside the craft than outside he noticed
a faint but unpleasant smell somewhat he said like decaying meat he also noticed
that the interior was dimly lit but he could see no actual light
source as Alfred says in his own words there was a light it was very dim and
everything appeared black that's the funny part I didn't see anything like that meaning a light but there was a
light in there whether it was around the ridge of the ceiling the inside of the craft was all
black when I walked across the floor I didn't hear my own footsteps so I got
the impression that there was some sort of cloth down on the floor the ceiling
was only about 5 ft high and it was as much as I could do to get into it I am
5' 4 and2 in so they were a shade shorter than I am I had to Bob down
going into the door and the light was good enough to see where we were going
but once we got inside there was a dim light but this must have been due to the
Blackness of it presently a voice said in broken English come over and stand
under the amber light well right in the center of the floor there was a column that went up
about 4 feet in circumference this column that was in the middle of the floor there was a Z
shaped handle on it such as you might see on a well and there was a form a
being standing on either side of that there were two different forms from
those that had accompanied me along the canal path I took it to be these two
forms were standing by ready to wind the gear that drove it that is only my
suspicion at first I couldn't see an amber light but when I stepped to one side I could
see the light on the wall I walked over and stood under the light and this voice
asked me to come over and stand under the light asked me what is your age I
said I shall be 78 next birthday so at this point says Alfred
there was a pause the ET said in a kind of sing strong voice turn around Alfred
obeyed he turned around faced the wall remain there he said for a good five
minutes he was able to get a good look at the craft at this point and was very much impressed by its Flawless
construction as Alfred says whoever built that thing certainly made a good
job of it there were no nuts bolts joints or welds that I could see I
reckon I was in there a good half hour hour I had to wait for a while with this chap standing around
me so finally after about 5 minutes of waiting the ET responded and said you
can go you are too old and infirm for our
purpose and at this point uh Alfred
says I looked around and when he said you can go I came down as I was coming
down holding the banister rail on the steps I felt two joints in it which gave
me the impression that the steps were telescopic and folded up in it anyway I
came down and got about 20 or 30 yards from them and then turned around and
watched it it had a turret on top of it very much like an inverted saucer but it
looked like a cowl like you would have on top of a chimney but instead of going around clockwise it went anti
clockwise I carried on back to where my dog and my tackle were and the first
thing I did was to pick up my cup of cold tea and drank it still watching I
saw it lift up about 300 ft and it shot off to the Southwest over the military
cemetery and out of sight so Alfred says as this object took
off it made a loud whining noise and other than the initial shock when the
beings first approach roed him at no time did he feel any real fear as he
says in his own words I was more Curious than anything at my age nearly 78 what
have I got to worry about I can only die once I had read about UFOs and I didn't
believe in them up to then I took the UFOs to be a lot of bunk well I
definitely do now and seeing is believing I don't give a damn who
believes it or who doesn't but I definitely went into that machine I
definitely wasn't scared just curious and I wanted to see what was going on if
they had taken off with me then it would have been just my lot it would have been
just the same as me going out on the street and being knocked down I wasn't
scared or anything like that I was just curious I've spent many years out of
doors and tackled many things in C Canada shot a bear rers wolves I don't
think I'm scared of anything now at the time all of this was going on Alfred was wondering if these
beings these figures were perhaps Russian or Chinese spies and it was only later after hearing others report UFOs
that he began to wonder about other explanations Alfred did admit that he
was quote mildly disappointed that the ETS had no use for him but he took the
whole experience and stride after the UFO left he went on fishing catching
several fish he walked home on his way home he encountered two policemen told
them a little bit about his experience and they seemed very much believing in
fact one told him yes I dare say you did see a UFO I expect they were checking on
our military installations and as it turns out there are in fact quite a few military
establishments in that area so Alfred went home and he wasn't
going to tell his wife her friend was there he didn't want to talk about it
but his wife could see that Alfred was quite upset and insisted on knowing what
happened so he did he shared his story with her with his wife's friend also
told his son and later he wrote to the newspaper not really sharing his
encounter at all but just asking if anybody had reported any strange lights
in the area on that night and the reporter became curious
and actually called Alfred back and this is how we ended up hearing about this
case because the newspaper reporter realized Alfred had had a major
encounter and referred him to an investigator now Alfred's wife Marjorie
says and I quote what Al told you was the absolute truth my friend who was
with me when Al came home can verify what he said he looked absolutely shaken
and he told both of us about his experience that he had with the UFO I was a bit frightened when he told me but
I did not take any more notice it has been bothering him ever since and he has
been losing sleep over it he obviously believes what he saw and I believe him
so after Alfred told his story she turned to him and said no more fishing
for you now Alfred was interviewed many times by researchers and reporters and
he would told them that it was quote the greatest experience of his life he did
return to the site two days later and saw where the UFO had landed that the vegetation was all flattened and in
disarray but not planning on ever telling anybody fearing ridicule and
disbelief he had no interest in collecting any type of evidence or trying to prove his
encounter he did say that following his encounter he experienced a loss of
appetite and some resulting weight loss but the case got quite a bit of
attention it was covered in many books such as by Jenny randles and Timothy
good Gordon kraton editor of the Flying Saucer review writes and I quote it will
be noticed that this account contains several features that are already familiar to us from other cases there is
for example the central stem or pillar inside the craft which has appeared on
several reports and has been claimed by some investigators to be a polarized
magnetic Contraption intimately related to the secret method of propulsion
employed by the ETS or at any rate some of them now researcher Hillary Porter
visited the site several times over the years and was surprised to see that this
area was now being guarded by fully armed soldiers dressed in
black Timothy good interviewed the witness Alfred beru and
came away absolutely convinced of the case as Timothy good says in his own words it is a very important case and
quite exciting I am convinced he is telling the truth and his was a genuine
experience this is one of the most convincing close encounter cases I have investigated there is no doubt in my
mind that he was taken on board in Alien craft another investigator who
interviewed Alfred in dep is Omar Fowler and he writes we can confirm that a
number of the incidents he said occurred are consistent with known UFO
characteristics this is really an exciting case I believe it to be genuine
I am convinced his story is absolutely true and this actually
happened interestingly following Alfred's encounter there was in fact a
wave of sightings in the area now unfortunately about 3 years
following his encounter in 198 6 Alfred ber passed away at age 80 after a long
Illness but it's certainly an interesting case one of the more interesting things I think is how this
witness Alfred just like Paulo described how these rooms were very short in
height too short for a person to even stand up in so what a case that is I
think it's hard to disbelieve this case so certainly with people like Timothy
good uh saying that this is a legitimate case or one of the main investigators Omar Fowler calling it one of the best
cases he's ever researched it's a super super interesting case and uh it's
really unfortunate that the witness has now passed on because would have been
very fascinating to speak with him but wow what a case
and now we move on to another case which I call we are your friends this is the
last case I'm going to be covering today I don't have the exact location of this
case but it occurred somewhere in the United States somewhere in the midwest I
believe and occurred in the year 1990 this is a singular event I will be
describing but it comes from a witness who's had a lifetime of encounters who
felt it was important to share this one experience to let other people know that
they are not alone that's certainly one of the reasons I do this research
because I think the onboard experience is far far more common than most people
realize and most people aren't talking about it thankfully that is changing
thanks to cases like this one although the exact date and location of this case
is not stated this is a firsthand account of an onboard encounter from someone who did reveal
her real name Sharon Beals she's a medical researcher and I think the case
has some important things to teach us about ETS in an article for UFO encounters
magazine she wrote about this one experience and she's had many of her close onboard
encounter it began one evening around 4:30 a.m. 1990 or thereabouts when she
woke up to hear a loud buzzing noise over the house and looking up through
the Skylight she saw a quote fairly large white light moving overhead this
was followed by another smaller one which was moving in an irregular pattern
now being nearsighted Sharon went to go get her glasses and it was at this exact moment
that her 2-year-old old daughter Kelly came running in now Kelly had been complaining recently about monsters and
quote Sky monkeys so now so she comes running into the room and is holding on to Sharon and
the next thing Sharon knows hours have passed she and Kelly are now both waking
up and the previous anxiety that she had been feeling that evening was now
replaced by quote an Absol absolute sense of Peace but then she found a couple of
weird things which helped her to understand that this had been a much more extensive
encounter she found out her that her eyeglasses were completely bent out of
shape as you can see here from Sharon's drawing and then she went to change
Kelly's diapers and was absolutely shocked to see that they were filled with pine needles this made no sense
whatsoever but it was a clear clear indication that something had happened
so she decided to seek help she contacted C Lee Culver a hypnotherapist
and UFO researcher and he agreed to place her under hypnotic regression and
was under hypnosis that she recalled seeing two figures come into her room
and the next thing she knows she and her 2-year-old daughter Kelly are being lifted up into the sky she turn then
reports feeling a sense of paralysis an inability to open her eyes but when she
finally was able to she found herself in a a rounded room surrounded by short
humanoids with large oval eyes a small nose a slit for a mouth large bald heads
and a long neck and arms she said they were pale skinned and were all working
quite quietly there was no real sound at all going on in the room as Sharon says
it is very quiet like everyone has a job and they are very focused and there
doesn't seem to be any emotion now Sharon couldn't see her
daughter at this point but mentally as though with a telepathic Rapport she
could see that Kelly was being physically examined by the ETS on a
table uh she seemed to be unhappy about it Kelly and was resisting it and the
ETS were telling her it's okay don't worry it's okay at this point one of the Grays
walked right up to Sharon placed its face right in front of hers and stared
at her this is something we do often hear in close encounter reports and this
ET told Sharon telepathically there's no harm coming to you to your baby no harm no hurt and
then she could physically see her daughter laying on a flat bed she saw another human boy there being apparently
examined she says she was then taken to another room where she saw this Strang
looking being sitting behind a desk this was a little different from the others she had seen this being had wrinkled
skin tan in color and had this weird sort of golden v-shaped instrument
attached to its forehead she said that this being had large Blue Eyes a very small not nose
and mouth it woree a fitted uniform with a star-like emblem on its left chest and
she did have the feeling that this being was the boss was the one in charge and it spoke to her again telepathically and
it said we've been over and over this you're safe you know nothing can harm
you we've been over and over this you shouldn't be fighting me you shouldn't
be fighting us we're your friends you share with us us do you want to save it
or not do you want to save the planet so looking around Sharon did see
several other humans in the room they were all pretty much sitting in a circle on the floor she did see her daughter
who was kind of holding lovingly on to her and it was interesting because nobody in the room seemed afraid or
disturbed though pretty much all of them seemed to be in a trance of some kind
and Sharon was surprised that she appeared to be the only one who was fully awake and
aware now at this point an opening appeared in the center of the floor and
everyone started dropping down into separate CRA craft she said it was almost like a laundry shoot and each
person was going into the craft that had taken them up into the bigger craft the
next thing Sharon knew it happened to her and she's standing with Kelly in their front front yard and they walked
up to the porch steps and tried to open the front door but it was locked they were locked outside and it was at this
moment that something very interesting happened a large v-shaped craft appeared
overhead and Kelly had the strong impression it was a facilitator this craft picked her and
Kelly up and put them back inside transporting them through the roof of
their home and as they were sat down her little daughter Kelly sat up and smashed
her head against Sharon's glasses completely bending them out of shape so
now Sharon had her answer and she knew what happened to her glasses she knew what happened during this missing time
and following this session she was absolutely Amazed by the depth and detail of her recall and as she wrote in
her article and I quote it's time to find out what what's going on I went to
bed that night after the session pondering everything in the universe God
spaceships alien beings and the future of our planet lying there I committed
myself to finding the truth behind these lifelong experiences what I particularly
love about that case is the witness gave a very long firsthand account of exactly
what happened to her and she saw quite a few other people on board the craft as
well it does involve her daughter which shows that this is as we know often a
generational experience and a lot of the details she describes are certainly ones we've heard
before it's all around a fascinating case so there you go that's our show for
today five amazing onboard UFO Encounters of all different kinds
involing all different types of ETS cases coming from all over the world
stretching back decades up to the 1990s so that's quite an interesting
perspective there and I think teaches us quite a bit about what it's like to have
an ET encounter and who these ETS are and why they're here on this planet I
think it's becoming almost undeniable at this point that this is a real thing
skep ICS don't have a leg to stand on I think if someone is truly skeptical of
UFOs and onboard experiences they simply haven't done their research uh the
evidence is overwhelming disclosure has happened the ETS have provided us enough information
to make solid conclusions about what's going on we don't need our governments
to tell us this is real there are so many cases it's already obvious that
there is validity to this phenomenon so there you go hope you've enjoyed this episode I truly appreciate
you watching and as as always please ask those important
questions keep looking for the truth and most important of all keep having fun
until next time bye for now.
