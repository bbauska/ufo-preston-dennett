Nov 17, 2023
The UFO phenomenon is one of the most persistent and perplexing mysteries of modern times. While it has become increasingly evident that we are dealing with extraterrestrials, there are still many questions surrounding UFO activity on our planet. Cases of face-to-face contact with ETs remain the heart of the UFO phenomenon, but UFO sightings are far more numerous. This video presents 15 unusual and provocative sightings from across the planet, each of which raises important questions and provides profound insights.

THE MINIATURE UFO. One day in 1932 in Nambour, Australia, a young boy was playing with his friends when he came upon a landed craft only one foot wide. Standing next to it, he felt strange sensations in his body. He retreated from the object, which promptly took off. That night, blisters formed on his hands.

THE FAITH HEALER & THE FLYING SAUCER. In 1950 in Kenya, Africa, a faith healer visited the home of a man whose mother had suffered a stroke which left her paralyzed. While healing the woman, the faith healer told to the man to go outside and look at the sky. The man was shocked to see three UFOs.

THE UFO AT THE BUS-STOP. On May 9, 1956, Gertie Wynn and her friend Joan Frost sat at a bus-stop in Jacksonville, FL when a UFO dropped from the sky and hovered overhead. Both felt certain they were about to be kidnapped by the UFO. Just then, the bus arrived.

DIVE-BOMBED BY A UFO. Around 11pm on Jun 24, 1957, three teenagers were driving near Russellville, IN when they saw a UFO overhead. The next night at the same time and place, the UFO returned. This time, it swooped down and ejected a smaller object which entered their car and exploded.

UFO CAR CHASE. On the night of Mar 13, 1967, Cecil Perkins was in his home in San De Fuca, WA when a man knocked on his door saying that a UFO had chased him down the highway. Looking up, Cecil was amazed to see that the UFO still there.

THE UFO THAT TALKED BACK. On Nov 15, 1967, Alan Poole was driving at Yerecoin, Australia when a UFO landed right next to his car. It was so close, he could barely open the door. Alan shouted at the UFO. To his amazement, the UFO shouted back at him, then took off.

FIREFIGHTING ALIENS. In Jun 1968, southern Morocco was struck by a heatwave which caused more than 16 wildfires. One witness described how he saw a saucer-shaped craft drop down and hover above one of the fires, which immediately became extinguished!

UFO SETS MAN’S HAIR ON FIRE. On Jul 20, 1968, Anders Stenlund stood in his front yard in Norrland, Sweden. Suddenly, a 23-foot-wide saucer swooped over his head. Anders threw himself to the ground in fear. At that point, he felt a blast of heat and smelled something burning. To his shock, it was his hair!

MORSE CODE UFO. On Jun 18, 1971, a family from Ben Lomond, CA was puzzled when the electronics in their house began pulsating in a weird Morse Code-like pattern. Looking outside, they saw a UFO blinking in the same pattern. Not only that, so were the city lights all around them!

THE UFO AND THE FREEZER. On Dec 5, 1973, a family was in their home in La Selva Beach, CA when their freezer alarm went off for no reason. Looking outside, they saw a UFO blinking in rhythm to their freezer alarm.

HARRASSED BY A UFO. After a UFO swooped over a family’s campsite on Jun 18, 1972 in Barstow, CA, they found themselves being followed by the same UFO the next night and forced off the highway. When others stopped to help the family, they also saw the UFO.

WHAT THE UFO DID TO THE GAS STATION. On Jul 31, 1976, Eldon’s Standard Service Station in Council Bluffs, IA suffered a series of bizarre damage to the equipment in the station. Meanwhile, people in the area saw a UFO hovering only 100 feet overhead.

SUSIE’S PUPPIES & THE UFO. On Feb 4, 1978, the Semaza family of Orange, CA was awakened by a UFO buzzing over their home. Meanwhile, their dog, Susie (who had a new litter of puppies) also heard the UFO, and she was not happy. Susie began to hide her pups to protect them from the UFO.

WASHED-UP UFO. On the night of May 29, 1971, a man was walking along Yaquina Beach in Newport, OR when he came upon a strange glowing object that had apparently washed onto the beach from the ocean. He called the police who also saw the object. Before they could investigate, the object disappeared.

ALIEN ALIBI. In 2000, a man was arrested by the Des Moines, IA police for trespassing into a stranger’s home. The man, however, protested his innocence. He said that he had not broken in. He had been 170 miles away when a UFO scooped him up. The next thing he knew, he woke up in the stranger’s house.

These 15 cases show how even a simple sighting can raise more questions than they answer. They show that every encounter is unique and provides an important piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. And most importantly, they make it very clear that we are not alone in this universe.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. Today's episode is called "15 UFO Cases That Make You Go...Hm...". By that I mean these are cases that 
are just a little bit different offbeat sort of. What you might call outliers 
with unique and really unusual elements. Now, none of these cases involve
humanoids. Don't worry, they're still super interesting. I know humanoids
are probably the most interesting aspect of extraterrestrial contact these are
the closest of UFO encounters but sightings are also super interesting and
let's face it the fact is sightings far outnumber cases of direct contact
face-to-face meetings with ETS or onboard experiences in other words if you're going to have a UFO encounter
it's most likely going to be a sighting and while they usually don't have as much data sometimes they do and
sometimes weird things happen that make them super interesting and those are the kind of cases I've chosen today cases
that really make you think really make you speculate about what is going on
here I've got cases that come from all over the world 15 cases that start as
early as the 1930s all the way up to the year 2000 of course these are cases that
come from all over the world I love to choose cases that are widely spread
geographically most of these do occur across the United States but there are a couple from Africa more specifically
Morocco and Kenya a couple from Australia one from Sweden most of these
cases are quite brief little sort of interesting news items that were
appeared in various newspapers uh but some were professionally investigated for sure and some are quite
extensive a good number of them do involve physical evidence and by that I
mean Landing traces physiological effects injuries
and even a healing of course emotional repercussions an encounter can affect a
person a person very profoundly and that's true for sightings so animal effects as well um a
wide variety of physical evidence electromagnetic effects and so forth so that's important
a lot of these cases are of course multiple witness cases as well and each
case no matter how brief I think does have something to offer it's another piece of the puzzle
towards understanding extraterrestrial contact on our planet so 15 cases is a lot again some
are quite brief some are long but it's still a lot so let's just get started
and the first case I'd like to talk about I call a miniature UFO this one
took place in 1932 in Nambour Queensland in
Australia it's quite an unusual case given how early it took place it does
have physiological effects it also has multiple Witnesses and it's just really unusual
this very early case involves an anonymous young boy who was playing with other children and wandered off to
explore a small hill covered with grass and he heard this low humming noise and
decided to go investigate and I'll just quote the witness directly as he says I
put both hands up in front of me and parted This Tall Grass to look through I
heard a low humming sound and saw a round object directly in front of me
about 4 ft away it looked the same shape as if two ordinary saucers were placed
face to face and then turned on their sides the color of the object was the
same shade of silver gray as a canbera bomber looks on a dull rainy overcast
day the size of the object was about 12 in in diameter it hovered 3 in above the
surface of the water so this is in many ways your typical Flying Saucer metallic only it's
a foot wide very strange and long before
flying saucers were a thing now as this thing hovered just 3 inches above this
little puddle of water the witness noticed something very strange there was a disturbance on the water as if this
object was putting out he speculates some sort of force field cuz it was
causing these sort of concentric circles to ra radiate outwards on the surface of
this water and I'll just let the witness describe what happened next as he says
in his own words there was a very high-speed shiver motion of the object as if a gyro
stabilizer of some kind were keeping it upright as I bent forward to look more
closely the humming sound Rose suddenly in pitch and volume and at the same time
a whitish mist began to form between me and the object but close to it at the
same time I felt a tight feeling in the head and as the noise increased I let go
of the tall grass and stepped back I could not see it anymore and I felt
stunned in the head but I could still hear it humming Behind The Tall
Grass soon afterwards everyone decided to go up to the house and on the way one
girl said suddenly what was that something flew up between those
trees someone else said it was a magpie and the first girl said no it was not I
did not see anything but I knew what it was it was the object flying off that
night I noticed large white blisters on both of my hands and I felt out of
sorts sometime during the night whilst I was asleep most of the blisters burst
and one or two remaining burst during the day and a clear fluid like water
came out I felt better after that so it's clear there was some kind of
radiation that caused these physiological effects it's quite an unusual case I like that case because we
got to hear firsthand from the witness who left a quite detailed report of what
he saw and how it affected him and again it is a multiple witness case which
always raises the level of credibility of the case it's also a very early
report well before the term UFOs and flying saucers were popularized in our
culture so that alone makes it truly significant and again those
physiological effects that is very interesting and now we move to our next
case which I call the faith healer and the Flying Saucer uh this is a super interesting
case which occurred in mid 1950 in Kenya
Africa and this was investigated by a researcher so that's important but it's
a super unusual case where someone received an incredible healing and UFOs
were peripherally connected to this very strange event this very odd case comes
from researcher Carl Van Varden he's quite well known the witness is an
anonymous astronomer and actually then the president of East Africa's
astronomical Association and an executive of the East African Railways and harbors
Administration so a good witness and when this man's mother suffered a stroke
which left her paralyzed and Beyond the help of doctors he sought out the help of a well-known faith healer from
Nairobi who was also actually an employee of the same
company so this faith healer was very famous and well known for going into a
trance and effectively curing people of various illnesses and conditions so
wanting to help his mother the astronomer invited the faith healer to his home in Kenya to affect a cure on
his mother the Healer went into the mother's room entered into a trance like he
normally does and began to lay his hands on her to heal her but while in a trance
he started speaking to the astronomer and told the astronomer to go outside to
his telescope now the astronomer had a telescope which he kept in a small out
building and this faith healer told him to go out there and look at a certain
section of the night sky so intrigued the astronomer obeyed
the faith healer's instructions and looking through the telescope at the designated spot in the sky he was
shocked to see three glowing objects that shouldn't be there these were not stars in fact they started to move and
flew information across the sky this astronomer who had no prior belief in
UFOs of course instantly came to believe in them because he saw them himself so he returned into his home and
was now even more amazed to see that his mother was now sitting up and free of
the crippling paralysis that no other doctors had been able to cure so this was reported on by a
reporter Brian Parks who worked for the Daily Express he interviewed the witnesses hoping to publish a story in
the Daily Express but that newspaper declined to print the story saying it
was quote too far out thankfully the story was later published in the Durban
South Africa Tribune and that's how we came to hear about it here to me that's
definitely a case that makes you go hm what were those UFOs doing there did
they know about this healing taking place how did did this faith healer know
they were there predict this sighting there's a lot of unusual elements to it it's pretty
interesting and now we move to the next case which I call the UFO at the bus
stop and this is a really unusual case that did receive quite a bit of attention from investigators because
there were not only two main Witnesses but a number of other supporting
Witnesses these this object objects actually came quite close to the
witnesses and uh as we shall see it had some significant
implications because this case was right before the idea of people being taken on
board a UFO really started to become a thing and that's what these Witnesses
felt this UFO was coming to do take them on board so that makes this case super
important this very interesting case occurred on main9 1956 in Jacksonville
Florida and it's only pure luck and Circumstance that we came to hear about
it at all because this case came to the attention of pioneering UFO researcher
Leonard Stringfield when the father of one of the witnesses wrote to him about
what happened to his daughter her name is Joan Frost Joan had written a letter
to her father explaining what happened to her and her girlfriend whose name was
Gertie win one evening in Jacksonville Florida
it's quite an interesting account and I will just let Joan Frost describe what
happened in her own words as Joan says something happened to my girlfriend
Gertie and me last night that scared me out of 10 years of growth we went to a
dance on the outskirts of Jacksonville by bus we didn't like it there so we
left at 10:15 we were waiting for the bus to go home on this small side street there was
no one around so per the witnesses they were waiting at the bus stuff on Water
Street and as Joan says and I quote we waited until 11: or later and this is
what happened we looked up and saw two stars moving very high they were
flashing on and off following each other they were traveling across the sky at a
terrific rate of speed we thought at first they were falling stars except
they didn't fall but went out of sight about 15 minutes later they came back
and one went up into the other it came over towards us and dropped lower and
lower until it got just over us I have no idea of what size the object was as
it was very dark and there were no street lights in that area it was approximately a distance of three
telephone poles above us maybe four it was round and red and had three lights
on it the thing didn't make a sound no engine motor or
anything as it came down toward us and while in the sky it appeared to have three lights on it which were pulsating
however as it tipped downward and hovered above us it seemed to be surrounded by an eerie Deep Red Mist of
light this is why at first we thought it was a red hot falling star
but then realized that even though it was descending at a terrific speed a
star or meteor would drop even faster so things started to get really
strange because according to the witness as this object dropped down they could
see it was a solid craft and they saw what looked like a door on the bottom of
this thing as Joan says again in her own words the door on the bottom appeared to be
like a bomb bay shaped in a long square with only three cracks visible I started
to run down the street and Gertie just stood there with her mouth wide open
just then the bus came and the object rose again the door on the bottom opened
up and the other object came out we saw the door but did not take too much
notice of its size because when it looked like we were going to be picked up by the object I
got terrified and started to run down the street and Gertie just stood there staring up at it we thought we were
goners for sure whatever they were they saw us standing there the two objects
started moving slowly away there were only a few people on the bus and they
and the driver got out we all watched the objects go for about 10
minutes the bus driver said they couldn't be jet planes because of being so low we would surely have heard the
jet engines we knew they weren't Jets now this is all Joan talking but
Gertie also gave an interview and she said and I quote the object just went
above our heads there was definitely no sound at all I sure had a fear of being
kidnapped now the bus driver his name was wallet L Marlo he worked for the
Jacksonville Coast company operating the Lake Shore or number 22 bus so he pulled
up to the bus stop and stepped out and saw these objects and I'll just let him
describe what he saw as Wallace says I saw two strange objects in the
air just above the girls and ahead of my bus I pulled on down to where the girls
were standing and got out of the bus and looked at the objects myself they
hovered just above us for a second then they both went up into the air at a high
rate of speed as I recall the girls were terribly frightened when they boarded
the bus and I do believe they mentioned something to the effect that they thought they were about to be
kidnapped so needless to say this counter frightened both Joan and Gertie
very much and as Joan says Gertie and I shook all night long my girlfriend and I
did not notify the police or anyone of this incident and as far as I know I do
not believe the newspapers recorded the sighting we didn't say anything to anyone because we are young and felt
people would just say we were crazy or making up a nice big story I did write
to my dad though because he knows I am sensible and wouldn't relate anything
that wasn't a reality after our experience we bought two books on flying saucers and are
going to study them a really amazing case and it's interesting to me how very
nearly we did not hear about this it's once again a reminder that most cases go
unreported and undocumented so this is something that's much more common than people people
realize I also wonder what would have happened if that bus didn't show up when
it did would these two young ladies have been taken on board it's entirely
possible cuz that's certainly what they felt was about to happen a super
interesting case on multiple levels and now we get to another case which is just
beyond weird and definitely makes you go hm and I call this one dive bombed by a
UFO now there are lots of cases of people who have UFO encounters while
they're driving but this one goes a bit more than just a UFO car encounter it
does involve four Witnesses it does involve some minor physiological effects
as well and it's not just one sighting but two which seem to be intrinsically
connected and it got quite a bit of attention from researchers this case occurred over a
period of two days well nights actually June 24 through 25
1957 in Russellville Indiana it was around 11:00 p.m. on a
Monday June 24 four teenagers from Green Castle Indiana including Jerry bran
George Bennett both aged 17 and their friends Bob Coleman and Jackie Glover
both age 18 were traveling Along by car on Highway
234 not far from Russellville so they were actually
traveling from Russellville to Green Castle when a glowing object with colored lights swooped down over their
car and went off so is a brief sighting but it wasn't until the next night June
25 at the same location and the same time that they had a much closer
encounter with what apparently the same UFO they had parked their car a few
miles east of Russellville again along the same Highway when they saw a huge
red light in the sky without warning it suddenly dropped down over the car and hovered very low
about 200 feet overhead and as Jackie Glover says in his own words it wasn't
shaped like anything we had ever seen it appeared to be around 50 50 by 100 ft in
size equipped with large white lights on each side several other colored lights
also were visible we were flabbergasted at the monstrosity as it hung in the sky
over our car so curious the boys decided to flash a spotlight on the object and
immediately after flashing the spotlight on and off the towards the UFO it zoomed
lower over the car and this really frightened the young men they took off in their car and to their
shock this object followed them and then suddenly it did something very strange
it sent down a smaller lighted object which actually zoomed right down entered
into the car through an open window and landed at Jerry's feet bounced up and
exploded against Jackie's cheek it created a really brilliant flash of
light there was a sharp explosive sound reminding them much of a firecracker thankfully nobody was
injured later they did find bits of yellow and purple paper in the car could
this have been a firecracker they don't know there was no one in the area that they saw but it frightened them all in
fact Jackie said it frightened him so bad he cried so in you know mind you he's 18
years old so at this point the object took off and as Jackie says in his own words it shot
Upward at great speed and then moved North like a bolt of lightning the boys continued to speed
away they were still a bit shook up and moments later they hit this bump in the
road and heard two weird clicking noises which they believed sounded like the hub
caps coming off the front wheels of their car so they stopped backed up to the
this bump and got out and sure enough looking at the wheels the hub caps had fallen off but were now both missing and
they did a quick search but failed to locate them and it being still dark and
then being frightened they continued onward but they did return to the spot
the next day to search for the missing hubcaps but never did find them they were apparently gone really strange the
boys wondered if perhaps the magnetic attraction of the UF had literally sucked them off the car
hard to say for sure but they did notify the police and putam County Sheriff Joe
rowlings said that his office had actually received several reports from residents who had seen quote saucers
apparently in this area at that time and they provided the same description as given by these four young men and this
officer also issued a warning inv iing young people to refrain from saucer
hunting at the location of this sighting that case is interesting to me because I've never heard of anything quite like
it and it's also interesting to me that the police became involved and actually issued a warning to people uh not to go
looking for UFOs uh yeah I mean it's just interesting in a number of different
ways and now we move to another case which also involves a person in a
vehicle I call this one a UFO car chase and yeah there are lots of cases of UFOs
chasing cars but what happened in this case I've never heard before it's got an
unusual element to it in some ways it's fairly typical but in others it's not I
think it's an important case it was researched by a investigator so that's
important it occurred on March 13 1967 in sanduka
Washington and I really feel for the witness in this case this bizarre case
occurred at 8:15 p.m. again on March 13 1967 Cecil Perkins was in his home in
sanduka when someone knocked on his door he opened the door and there standing in
front of him was a very distraught frightened young man he was pale
trembling and he had quite an incredible story to tell he told Cecil that he had
been driving in this area with his girlfriend when an object quote radiating a bright orange light came
upon his car hovered over it and kept pace with it while he drove down the
highway and no matter what speed he went this object remained
overhead so he became frightened and sped up and slowed down and could not
shake this car or this UFO and finally he came screeching into Cecil Perkins
driveway ran to the door and informed Cecil of this UFO which by the way was
still hovering overhead now unknown to this Anonymous man this driver while the UFO was
following his car there was another gentleman Bert James who was driving on
the same Highway when he saw this man and woman who were being chased in their
car by the UFO and as Bert James says in his own
words the car came up behind us at high speed and passed us there was an intense
light and we thought it was a spotlight or the light from a police car the girl
in The Passing Auto had her hands over her eyes and we could hear her screaming
we were concerned and we were going to give Pursuit if she needed help so they didn't fully understand
what was going on and Bert who was driving had two other people in the car
with him and they followed a short distance at which point the man pulled into Cecil Perkins driveway and this is
when Bert and his companions saw the UFO hovering overhead and at the same time something
very strange happened Bert's own car stopped of its own accord the engine
motor died and the headlights went out and as Bert says in his own words it was as if
someone something had turned off the engine there was no power we couldn't
get the car started it was then that we noticed this flying object for a moment
or two we could see it hovering on the brow of a hill behind the trees and then
it would disappear it was sort of like it was playing peekaboo as if it was watching us
the object finally disappeared but Bert had had enough he and his friends
decided unanimously to depart the scene and head for the protection of their home now later investigators of course
did find out about the case interviewed Cecil Perkins and Bert James the first
driver unfortunately was never located but researchers did learned that there were several other sightings of what was
apparently the same object in the same area on that same night so quite a few
people apparently saw this what I like about that case and what really made me go hm is the fact that this UFO was
chasing this car so low over it for such a long period of time and other cars
actually people in other cars actually saw this happening uh I mean can you imagine
being chased by a UFO and passing other cars and still this UFO is chasing you
down a highway and apparently ignoring the other cars it's
really unusual I don't know of a whole lot of UFO car chases quite like that so
that I think alone makes this case super interesting and now we get to the case
that really made me go hm and I think that of all the cases in this collection this is probably one of my favorite it's
so unusual I call this one the UFO that talked back and this occurred on
November 15 1967 in eurac coin
Australia and it's a very unusual case of a UFO landing right next to a person
and what happened when it landed is just off the charts bizarre and I think will
definitely make you wonder about what is going on here it was a cloudy windy
rainy day in urac coin and it was around 6:30 p.m. when Farm arm manager Alan P
had just finished rounding up the sheep and was getting ready to go home he
climbed into his Land Rover and started to drive but he was only about a mile away from the farm where he worked when
he heard this very loud humming noise which he said was very much like an electric motor at first he wondered if
his engine was breaking down but then he looked up and he saw a strange craft
about a half mile away but quite low in the sky only about 400 feet up in the
air and to his great alarm it appeared to be coming straight towards him and as
Allan says in his own words I thought it was an airplane but it kept on coming
towards me and suddenly landed beside my Rover nearly against the door say about
4 feet away I wondered what was happening I was completely perplexed the whining
noise was very loud and frightening so Allan described this
object as a gray metallic saucer about 12 feet wide 6 feet high with no
markings on it as he says quote it was
flat on the bottom and Dome shaped on top just like an upturned
saucer all I could see was this saucer with four four visible Windows two round
and two square but I was unable to see into them it appeared to be made of a
metal which was smoky gray in color there were no lights on it but there
were Port holes like Windows around it and there seemed to be a cabin in front
I didn't know what to do I partly opened the door to get out and said aloud to
myself to hell with you sport to my astonishment
the words echoed back to me I'm sure it was my own voice but this could not have
been an echo for there was a strong wind blowing away and it would be impossible
to produce an echo in that position Allen's car was running normally though
Allen's wife did report that at that time of the encounter her own TV started
acting up oh so she was not far away anyway
this craft was there for only a short moment about 10 seconds and then quickly
flew away as Allan says in his own words as I put one leg out of my car the
object suddenly took off vertically I was so frightened that I thought I was going
mad I sat back in the seat and trying to relax I rolled myself a cigarette I soon
got out of the car to have a look at the ground for signs of where the thing had been
the object was already out of sight although I could still hear the humming noise now there were no marks in the
ground Allan left the area and at first decided to keep quiet about his encounter but later called the police
but he's convinced he saw something very unusual as Allan says in his own words
this thing was not of this Earth I'm not offering any theories about it all I
know is that it was unlike anything we know on this earth now Allen's employer at the farm
his name is DV Waters said that if Allan that Allan had worked at the farm for 10
years and was very reliable and he said if Allan says he saw a flying saucer you
can take it from me that there was one there to a super close encounter very
strange and two days after this incident there were two other sightings less than
100 miles from urac coin so one encounter is R rarely a one-off usually
there's quite a bit of activity going on and that seems to be true in this case I
think you'll agree that's a truly Strange Case and the fact that there were other sightings in that area at
that time always lends credibility to it it's clear the witness was quite Shook
Up by what happened and I really wonder about it what why would the UFO just
repeat what the man is saying it's very bizarre so there's always another case
that's so amazing about this field of study there you might be skeptical of one case or another but there are
hundreds upon hundreds to you know back up what one case is
reporting so if you dismiss one case there's always another to take its place and here is another case which I
find fascinating it is super brief I don't believe it was professionally
investigated this was just a little brief news story that appeared in the
newspapers but it's quite unusual because we often hear about UFOs sending down beams of light or causing Burns or
something along those lines but this appears to be the opposite of that and I
call this one firefighting aliens and this incident occurred on June 21st
1968 in Morocco in June of 1968 Southern Morocco was suffering a
tremendous Heatwave that was causing a rash of wild fires in the area more than
16 of them now one gentleman wrote to the newspaper about all of this his name is
mifta and he wrote to the Moroccan newspaper litit
maraan and he said and I quote we learned that one of these fires the
cause of which not has not yet been established one in a field of wheat 14
hectares in area belonging to C AIS mesui of the mesui group of the Southern
anulan buera Clan it is reported that a luminous object resembling a shooting
star sudden landed in the field of Wheat and rapidly extinguished the fire flying
off again afterwards the Luminous object was
circular so again a very brief case but researchers found out about this and
speculated that perhaps the electromagnetic fields surrounding this object extinguish the fire so this could
have been an accidental byproduct or perhaps intentional hard to say but it's
certainly a very odd effect from a UFO so that's a case you can make up your
own mind about it I thought it was worth reporting because it is so unusual I'm
going to have to look into it to see if I can find other cases like it but as far as I know it's Unique so that I
think makes this case significant and here is another case
which is not wholly unique but I can't say I've ever heard one quite like it I
call this one UFO sets man's hair on fire and yeah as the title implies this
is quite a strange encounter which occurred on July 20th 1968 one month after the above case this
one occur occurred in Norland Sweden it's a very brief account that I don't
believe was professionally investigated though it was reported on by a researcher who found found the account
in a newspaper and it's a pretty interesting case of a very close-up sighting which
we would probably label as a close encounter of the second kind given that
it did affect the environment in this case the gentleman who was the witness
it was around 100 p.m. again on July 20th as Norland resident Anders stenland
was in his front yard and saw a UFO coming from the West directly towards
him and it was pretty big he said it was about 23 ft wide blue black in color and
looked like two saucepan Lids placed end to end so very much your typical Flying
Saucer he said it looked like it was surrounded by this bluish smoke and as
it came zooming towards him was suddenly only 100 ft above him and he felt like
it it was coming to Target him specifically and as it did he threw
himself to the ground to protect himself and he said that as it came over his
head he smelled something burning and felt Heat at his temples and it was then
that he noticed his hair had been burned very quickly the saucer curved
off to the East and left the area now Anders called the police
but they were unable to locate any other Witnesses so there was really no other
way to verify this other than the fact that ander's hair had been burned by
this UFO it's very odd what a weird case that was again feel for the witness in
that case that must have been very very scary and now we move to the next case
which I Call Morse code UFO there are lots of cases with very weird
effects from UFOs and this is certainly one of them what makes this one so
interesting that these effects were occurring over a widespread area and are some of the most unusual what we would
call electromagnetic effects that I think I've heard in a long time a super interesting case which
occurred on June 18 1971 over then lond in California but
actually the surrounding areas as well it was just about 1 a.m. very late at night or early in the
morning depending on how you look at it when Josephine Clark and Min Thompson
both who lived at 7900 Harvard Drive in Ben lont noticed something very
strange all the electric lights in the house and the TVs were dimming in and
out in an irregular pattern that reminded them of Mars
code so as this went on they decided to wake up their husbands Leonard Clark and
Tom Thompson to try and figure out what was going on and that's when they looked
outside and saw that the television antenna and the power lines across the
street were snapping and buzzing and get this this was in sync with the weird
pulse ations going on with the electrical activity in their own home
and now looking to the city lights of Scotts Valley and Felton and Boulder Creek not to mention
Ben lont they saw that the city lights all around them were doing the same
thing pulsating in this weird Rhythm so Tom grabbed an AC voltmeter
and he saw that the voltage was actually fluctuating from 5 to 8 volts between 113 and 115
volts and he could also smell ozone which is a product of electrical
Fields so they couldn't figure out what was going on and finally Tom Thompson
walked to the end of the deck and this is when he saw this huge UFO an enormous
orange glowing sphere hovering very low directly between two trees and he could
see immediately that this was not anything normal as Tom says in his own
words it seemed to Sparkle scintillate or twinkle steadily all sparkling like a
fisheye the edges of the desk were very round like a hoop it looked bigger than
the full moon so he watched it for about 30 seconds when suddenly it
disappeared and it was just a short time later at about 1:5 a.m. that a power
failure struck Ben lont and of course Scott Valley Felton and Boulder Creek
too it affected at least 10,000 people so this looks like a classic case of a
UFO caused blackout but it's so odd that it was affecting their own electricity
in their home in this weird pulsating sort of Morse code manner so with it
trying to send a message I don't know if I would go that far but it's certainly very odd so there you go a super
interesting case lots of cases where UFOs affect Electronics in a wide
variety of ways this one is definitely a little offbeat does appear to be a power
failure connected to this sighting so that is not terribly unusual there are a
lot of cases like that but I can't say I've heard one quite like this but it has four Witnesses for direct Witnesses
very closeup sighting so a super interesting case and now we move to the
next case I'd like to cover which I call the UFO and the freezer talk about unusual
electromagnetic effects well I'll just Dive Right into this case and you can
make up your own mind about it but as we shall see all this might sound like a
unique case I found another very very similar to it a couple actually which I'll report on right now
but this case occurred on December 5 1973 at laselva beach in California so
it was 2 years later and only 23 miles away from the above Morse code case that
another very similar and equally thought-provoking incident occurred began in mid November 19 1973
when a family in lelva Beach watched a UFO move over their home and off into
the distance and iown to them another witness in the area was also seeing UFOs
they actually called the police and they showed up and also observed the UFO but
it's what happened two weeks later on dece December 5th
1973 that really had this one family shaking their heads in puzzlement it was
sometime in the middle of the night that the son of the family woke up to hear an alarm going off
downstairs and going to investigate he saw that the family's freezer alarm had
been triggered this alarm goes off when the temperature in the freezer gets too
high so the son's mother also woke up and apparently the freezer was fine but
when they went outside they saw a UFO and it was just like the one they had
seen two weeks weeks earlier moving overhead and it was blinking in exact
rhythm with the freezer alarm as the sun says it went across the
sky and then came again it was real strange so as this alarm was continuing
to go off in the same Rhythm as this blinking UFO and not going away they finally
called the police who actually came to the house they verified both the UFO and
the freezer alarm and saw that they were going off at the same time finally this
craft moved off and presumably the freezer did return to normal but it's
one of these countless cases involving electromagnetic effects though this one
is admittedly very strange and here's another case which is
only peripherally related if at all but certainly is strange
this next one occurred in Webster Massachusetts on February 26
1967 and a wave of sightings struck this
area and at the time this gentleman was indoors and didn't see anything but he
says that he did notice the lights and the electrical appliances in his home went off for a few moments but when he
later returned to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator he says all his food
was frozen solid and he connects this to the UFO sighting and what makes this
super interesting is reportedly another family in Massachusetts this time in
Woodstock reported the same thing a UFO passing over their house and the next
morning the contents of their refrigerator were frozen solid weird electromagnetic effects for
sure so a case like that would be easy to dismiss if there weren't more than than one case like it so I don't know
quite what to make of it it's really unusual but as we have seen UFOs do have
the ability to electromagnetically affect all kinds of
our machines so perhaps that's what's going on here I don't think it was a
coincidence hard to say for sure but given that there are more than one case
like this well there you go I don't know that's why I titled this episode UFO
cases that make you go hm because they're quite strange and now we move on to the next
case which I call harassed by a UFO and this is a super unusual case for
a number of reasons the main Witnesses are a young family of four people uh husband the
wife and their two young daughters but it's quite a complicated case because it occurred over apparently
a period of two days and involves not just those four Witnesses but over 30
other Witnesses and another encounter that could very well be connected given
that it occurred in the same area at the same time this one occurred on June 18 and 19
in 1972 in sort of the Barto Victorville area of Southern
California and as we shall see it's a tremendous case this complicated and
very bizarre case occurred somewhere on a dirt road not far from Barstow California the Victorville area and it
does involve a large number of witnesses mostly one family a family
consisting of a husband and wife and two girls age 9 and 11 were camping in the
bar Stow area this was on June 18 1972 when a UFO appeared
overhead they said it made this very loud woring sound so loud it actually hurt their ears they said it came
swooping down quote almost on top of us and it at this time appeared to be a
quote big round orange colored thing but then it would Dart up in literally one
second at which time it took on a different appearance of quote just a big
bright blue dot high in the sky but then it would drop down again
always emitting this high pitched painful woring sound and then Dart up again and this went on for three hours
until it finally left as a result of this encounter the younger girl the
9-year-old child she became physically ill apparently from the trauma of all
this they reported the encounter to the police the next day and were told that
they must have been imagining things so they left the campsite and it
was the next evening around 11:30 p.m. and this same family was driving their
pickup camper and trailer between Barstow and Victorville when this same UFO appeared
this time swooping very low over the road and in fact the 9-year-old girl was
so frightened by its appearance that she grabbed the steering whe which caused
the father to lose control of his vehicle and drive off the road into a
ditch in the s in the sand and rocks and quickly became stuck now meanwhile this UFO dropped
down and began to swoop very low over them and then dart back up into the sky
performing these same Maneuvers that it had done the previous night so this poor
family was stuck stranded on the side of the road and struggled unsuccessfully to
get their vehicle back on the road when other people driving by stopped to help
among them were a brother and sister from Englewood they stopped to help and the
family explained about this UFO and the siblings this brother and sister were
skeptical at first until of course this UFO returned and they saw it themselves
it came swooping down very very low making this weird woring sound and then
darting back up into the sky and it wasn't long before other cars
began to stop and finally darl Toton and his two friends stopped and there were
now about 30 people there many cars pulled over and most of these people
were much more interested in watching this UFO performing its strange Antics
than in helping the family and and darl Totton saw it and he said that this quote strange circular
whatever it was was moving quickly about in the sky above us changing from bluish
white in color at higher altitude then to a weird orange yellow as it came
down so everyone there was talking about what was happening Daryl talked to
several of the people there including Air Force personnel some who speculated
the object might be secret military craft others who disagreed saying that
they wouldn't know about it but all of them were absolutely mystified by this object and darl approached the two young
girls who were part of this family and spoke to them directly as durl
says the still frightened girls told me their story between the several dips
this craft made over us while several strong men moved Boulders and pushed the
camper and trailer out of the ditch each time the thing seemed to move in on
us as though exploring the various automobile lights and flashlights trained on the repair job the two little
girls would cover their ears and throw themselves at their mother's feet sobbing while I tried to assure both the
mother and the girls that there was bound to be a logical explanation
somewhere Daryl however had to admit that he had no explanation he had never
actually believed in UFOs but he says that he was shook up when he saw this
object swoop very low near them close enough that he could hear this woring
which he said sounded like a vacuum cleaner and both he and the sister from
Englewood attempted to photograph this object they had cameras though apparently these photos
never came out they were certainly never publicly released but finally those who had
stopped to help heal did get this truck and camper back on the road at which
point the object left and everyone slowly dispersed continuing on their
interrupted journey and this whole incident would probably have never become known at all
if not for another encounter which occurred at that same night very nearby
when two Airmen from George Air Force Base their names were Randolph woen and
Gary Corley they said that around 1 a.m. shortly after the above encounter they
saw a 375 ft diameter bright orange orb so
this is the same description that the other people were giving could very well be the same object but they watched this
thing descend behind a building at George Air Force Base where they had been assigned as Security
Police now doing their job the officers reported it to the air police and to the
Victorville Victorville in Adelanto police who apparently alerted UFO
researchers and the newspapers as this account appeared in
the newspapers and this was how darl tton heard about this sighting and he
realized that the UFO he and the others had seen occurred on the same night very
near to this same location so apparently connected so while the first part of
that case wasn't professionally investigated unfortunately the second part involving
the two servicemen did receive an enormous amount of attention from researchers and was widely reported but
at the time no one knew it was connected to the first part of this case and as
the report says this first part of this case only came to light when when the
account of the two servicemen was published in newspapers so again makes you wonder
could there be other people having Encounters in that area at that time who never went
public uh just that one witness went forward to newspapers and there were 30
people there so I think that's a pretty clear indication once again that most people do not report their Encounters in
any official capacity which is so unfortunate because we're losing so much
data because of this whole UFO cover up has been very effective in that regard
thankfully it is failing it is crumbling truth is coming out fast and it's a new
era for I think for all Humanity as we are coming to recognize that we are
absolutely not alone the evidence for UFOs is undeniable and that moves us along to
our next very unusual case which I call what the UFO did to the gas
station so this is a very bizarre case which was professionally researched
which does involve a lot of witnesses which does involve some really unusual
effects that I am really not even sure how to categorize except perhaps as
electromagnetic effects or Landing traces well I'll let you make up your own mind about it once we get the facts
out on this case which occurred on July 31st
1976 over a gas station in Council Bluffs Iowa so many witnesses in this
case well let's just get right to it it was around 11:30 p.m. again on July 31st
1976 and Debbie faken was returning home from work she was driving by the Elden
standard service station located at 2710 South 24th Street in Council Bluffs
Iowa and she saw this oblong object with bright Windows hovering about 100 ft
above the gas station now she thought at first that it might be a helicopter but pulling off
the road to get a better look she could see that it had no tail no props she
heard no sound and in fact she watched as other cars also pulled over to look
at this strange object so she realized this was a uo not
a conventional aircraft she was completely amazed and decided to rush home to alert her brother-in-law Roger
Davids and together they returned to the gas station but unfortunately by then
the object was gone it had apparently left it had apparently just left as the
other cars who had hulled over ear ear were still there but unfortunately fearing ridicule
and disbelief Debbie at first told nobody about this sighting until she and
her brother-in-law learned that this gas station had suffered extensive and
unexplained damage and as it turned out a CB radio a burglar alarm and an adding
machine were reportedly quote damaged Beyond repair
also a vending machine malfunctioned and Spilled change all over the
floor now the gas station owner Elden bird believed that this was caused by
lightning and this is what he told the insurance agent however this might have been just
an excuse because obviously if you're going to call reporting a UFO did this
damage you're not going to be believed and in fact according to the National Weather Service
there were no storms in Council Bluffs on that night and also according to the
researchers who investigated this case they know three other Witnesses who were
near the gas station on that night and they reported that there was no rain no thunder or
lightning furthermore the technician who was called to examine the damage equipment so that the damage was
actually internal and the electrical cords themselves showed no damage which
lightning would have done so the gas station owner Elden bird
says he did talk to several customers who said that they also saw the UFO but he told investigators that he
said nothing for fear that people would quote think they were
crazy so many witnesses were interviewed by researchers including residents Mrs
ER Stanfill and others all who confirmed that this this weird craft hovered just
100 ft over the station itself apparently at the same time this damage
occurred now station attendants Mark Holt and Dan Stone did say that this was
caused by lightning strike and they made no report of any UFOs so there's some
controversy about what's going on here is this lightning just an
excuse did a UFO actually do this in any event it's quite unusual so clearly
there is some controversy surrounding that case and whether the damage to the gas station was caused by lightning
strike or what uh so hard to say for sure uh but it's super interesting that
this UFO was hovering directly over this gas station when it suffered so much
damage it's really odd definitely makes you go hm and now we move to to the next case
which to me is one of the most poignant in this little collection I call this one sues puppies and the UFO and I
wanted to include this case because this is a very profound example of animal
reactions caused by the presence of a UFO and this one occurred on February 4
1978 in Orange California this was investigated by
researchers it was reported in the newspaper as well uh was widely viewed
in terms of there being multiple Witnesses it's not just the primary Witnesses but the neighbors also saw
activity so it's an unusual case especially when you consider what
happened to this dog Susie and her puppies again there are many hundreds of
cases in which animals react strangely to the presence of a UFO but researcher
itel erson writes can anyone top this for animal
reactions was around 3:30 a.m. when Claire samza her 14-year-old daughter Donna and
her 11-year-old son Eric were woken up by a weird humming sound coming from
outside their home it quickly got louder and louder until it began to hurt their ears at
this point their dog Susie also apparently heard it now their dog Susie
had just given birth to a litter of puppies only two days earlier and when
this weird buzzing sound this humming sound started to appear Susie began to
whine and whimper and then she began to bark and howl whatever this was it was
driving poor suie crazy and as Claire samza says I can't explain it it was An
Extremely Loud humming like a mob of people were humming and all of a sudden
our dog Suzie began to set up a howl I was kind of afraid to look out the
window but she and her two children did look out the window and were shocked to see this strange oval craft hovering
overhead not far above the trees just a few thousand feet away from them and as
Claire says it looked like a flat round dish and was surrounded by a gray cloud
of smoke they said it had a bright red light at each end and it was sending shafts of
light towards the ground they also saw several blue white lights in a horizontal pattern between the two red
lights so later they did find out that their neighbor Dorothy Pascal had also
been awakened by this humming noise and this object it stayed there for a long
time about 30 minutes during which time su's anguish HS and whimpering
continued and every now and then Susie would stop barking and stare at the wall
with this weird expression that left all the samas deeply puzzled and even
stranger was what happened next Susie had seven puppies they were all snuggled
up in a box on the ground floor at the time this UFO appeared and Susie
apparently felt that danger threatened her little pups because she picked one
up by biting the Scruff of its neck and carried it upstairs and with the pup in her mouth
she wandered from room to room trying to find a safe place for her little pup and
none of these locations seemed to satisfy her she tried hiding her puppy under the bed but she didn't like that
and finally she took her pup out from under the bed and hid it behind the drapes and this was apparently the best
spot she could find because next she ran downstairs and carried the other six
puppies one by one back upstairs and secreted them behind the drapes hid them
after about a half hour the object finally left and as CLA samza says there
was a reddish glow in the sky around it that lasted for a while after it
disappeared the samasa is actually called the Orange Police Department who
referred them to UFO researcher Dr Elvin Lawson and as he found out later it
turned out that just a few hours after this encounter there was another sighting not far away from this area a
very strange case again there are lots of cases where animals react in unusual
ways in the presence of a UFO it's very clear that Suzie the dog was aware that
there was a craft out out there and was just taking steps to protect her puppies
um it's just a super fascinating case and again good evidence that animals can
sense things that we are not always aware of and here is another Super fascinating
case which is quite brief and wasn't professionally investigated by researchers but definitely caught the
attention of researchers it could have turned out to be a huge huge case but just didn't get
that far I call this one a washed up UFO this occurred on May 29
1981 at yaka Bay this is along the coast of Newport Oregon and it's a very
unusual case of what looks like a grounded UFO it was around 2:30 a.m.
again on May 29 1981 when an unnamed gentleman was walking along the beach
this is just North of the north yaka Bay Jetty when he came upon an object that
had apparently washed up on the beach that was his impression
impression this was on of course Yak yaka Beach and this object was about 20
feet wide 6 feet long and was made of a strange
material uh he could not identify it the witness walked up to this object and
kicked it and boy was he surprised to see that this object actually began to
glow when he kicked it and this is when he realized it was very unusual and he
called the police now police chief Spencer took the
call and he dispatched two officers to the scene they found the object but were
unable to identify it they walked around it they said it was not glowing but they
were unable to determine what this object was made from didn't look like it
was metal or wood or what they just weren't sure but they decided that they
were going to wait till morning to conduct a full investigation and they left the
scene and when they returned to the area in daylight this object was now gone so
they don't know if it was scooped up flew away or washed out to seea or what
they did contact the Oregon State University Marine Science Center in
Newport to assist in their investigation unfortunately the story
pretty much ends there and this weird mystery object remains
unidentified it's so unfortunate that case didn't go any further it's quite
likely that this craft whatever it was perhaps perhaps took off maybe it was recovered by military we just don't know
but the fact that the police verified this incident makes this significant
it's not just resting on one person's anecdotal account clearly not a piece of
wreckage given that this thing glowed it's you know there aren't ponon or
anything that just glow when you kick them so this was clearly an unusual
object and given that the police weren't even able to identify what it was composed of is also I think significant
so an unusual case and now we move to the last case of this Bunch which is very brief but kind
of interesting definitely makes you go and I call this one the alien Alibi and
this is just a very brief news clipping but I think it's important it occurred
in the year 2000 in Dam Mo de Mo Iowa and I'll just get to it and you can make
up your own minds about it there are very few details in this case but according to the de Mo Iowa police they
arrested a 37-year-old man for trespassing in a stranger's
house this man denied the charges of burglary and trespassing he declared his
innocence and said that he was actually 170 miles away from the location when he
was picked up by a UFO and then returned into the stranger's house now this
stranger's house happens to be about one mile from this man's actual home now the
police were skeptical they said they don't believe this man but they will reconsider his story if the ETS show up
at the station to support his quote alien Alibi as of yet of course this did has
not happened but this is not the only case of this kind to be reported oh yeah a very brief
case but it makes you wonder because why would someone come up with that excuse
to say why they're in someone's house uh breaking in cuz who's going to believe
that like oh yeah a UFO dropped me off in someone's house any other excuse
would make a lot more sense and I think that adds a level of credibility to this
gentleman's account and I can say that I know of several other cases like this
where people have been dropped off in the wrong location inside a person's home and in a few cases with the doors
locked so it's not a unique case in that regard so perhaps this gentleman's
reason for appearing in that house is 100% true fortunately we don't know
because it wasn't professionally inv investigated but still I think is super interesting and makes you go hm like was
that done on purpose or not it's very strange so that's the show for today I
hope you've enjoyed it I hope these cases made you think a little bit and wonder about the whole UFO
phenomena and yeah just sightings but I think you'll agree some of these sightings are super
interesting and whil it's much more interesting I think personally to talk
about humanoids and onboard encounters and this sort of thing we can't forget that sightings are a big part of the UFO
phenomena a lot of people have sightings it's something somewhere near 10 to
20% of the population claim to have had a sighting I think it's probably a
little higher than that hard to say for sure but again a big part of this
phenomena and again these cases go Way Way Back In Time far earlier than how
I'm reporting here uh but again in are occurring all over the world all kinds of witnesses
all kinds of evidence supporting these cases and more evidence that we are not
alone so that's it for today thank you very much for watching it's always
appreciated and until next time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth
most important of all keep having fun until next time bye.
