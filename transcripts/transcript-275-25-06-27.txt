UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE TWELVE
Jun 27, 2025

Summary:
Jun 27, 2025
Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown: Episode Twelve,” the ongoing UFO investigative series exploring a wide variety of locations on Earth, proving that every town and city on this planet has been visited by extraterrestrials. More than 100 locations have been explored, and all have a long and rich history of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters and more are all represented. Name any place on the globe, and you can find an encounter there. In this episode we explore nine new locations: Paducah, Kentucky; Shakopee, Minnesota; Wilton, Maine; Doncaster, UK; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Bensalem, Pennsylvania and Brigantine, New Jersey.

PADUCAH, KENTUCKY. In 1957, two men saw a UFO which caused their car to stall. In 1993, a family saw three metallic UFOs circling over their home. In 2005, a man saw a huge black triangle at very low elevation. In 2008, a young man saw a classic flying saucer right outside his window, an encounter which triggered profound changes in his life.

SHAKOPEE, MINNESOTA. In 2005 and 2013, two separate encounters occurred while the witnesses drove along the freeway and saw craft overhead. In 2015, a witness observed a brilliant object overhead and managed to capture a photograph of it. In broad daylight in 2006, a man saw a massive bell-shaped craft far too large to be any conventional craft.

WILTON, MAINE. On October 16, 2004, a mother noticed a strange static interference on her baby monitor. Going outside, she was amazed to see a string of colored lights hovering over the field behind her house. Her husband saw it too, and both became so uneasy, they fled inside.

DONCASTER, UNITED KINGDOM. In 1975, three boys saw a UFO so low, they thought it would land. In 1975, a family saw a UFO hover in the field behind their home. In 1980, 1988, 1997 and 1998 each produced high quality UFO sightings that researchers couldn’t explain. In one case the UFO was so low, the witness could smell it.

MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA. In 1952, a man saw a UFO over his farm and shot it with his gun. Days later, a reporter and his family saw apparently the same craft. In 1975, a man saw a classic saucer flying along the shoreline in broad daylight. In 2013, a couple saw a UFO after a fireworks display. In 2017 and 2022, two cases involved photographic evidence.

PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. In 1949, a pilot reported a near-miss with a UFO. In 1956, there were two cases of very unusual lights over the city. In 1966, two men reported a craft landing in front of their car and a face-to-face encounter with the UFO occupant. That same year, there was a UFO display involving a fleet of seven saucers. In 1978, more than a dozen police officers and hundreds of citizens saw UFOs.

MACON, GEORGIA. In 1950, the military dismissed eyewitness reports of speeding white objects in the night sky. In 1951, a military pilot encountered a UFO which played cata-and-mouse games with his aircraft for more than 10 minutes. One year later, multiple pilots saw a UFO by their planes. In 1955, there were at least two sightings of strange craft overhead. In 1957, three truck drivers encountered an egg-shaped object on the highway. In 1958 there was a sighting directly over Robin AFB. And one year later in 1959, more than 500 people reported unusual lights in the sky. In 1973, a woman reported her encounter with a landed UFO and strange beings in the forest outside of Macon. And in 1973, a rash of sightings involved more than a dozen police officers who were vehement that they had seen UFOs. Sightings continued in 2018 and 2019.

BENSALEM, PENNSYLVANIA. A very interesting case in Bensalem involved a couple who, in 1973, saw a boomerang-shaped craft and moments later, a dogman-like creature. In 1975, a man photographed a UFO almost identical to a photo published by J. Allen Hynek. In 1977, a family had a prolonged encounter with a classic flying saucer which resulted in direct contact. Another case in 1989 involved a witness who himself was a UFO investigator.

BRIGANTINE, NEW JERSEY. In 1953, a man saw a mothership come over the water and release several smaller craft. In 2015, a man had so many encounters with strange orbs, he finally was able to capture them on video. In 2019, a man saw a massive craft over the town which was nearly invisible in the night sky.
So many locations, so many cases, and so many firsthand eyewitnesses! The deeper you look, the more cases you find. The truth is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere on this planet. And the implications of this are profound. It means that UFO encounters are far more common than previously believed. It means that UFOs are apparently conducting a vigorous publicity campaign announcing their presence. And most important of all, it means that we are not alone, and UFOs are real!

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. I am continuing my ongoing series about UFOs in Your Hometown. And
in fact, this episode is called UFOs in Your Hometown, episode 12. I love doing
the research for these episodes. I learned so much not only about
geography, but about all these different cases that honestly I had no idea even
existed. I'm definitely proving my point that UFOs are ubiquitous. They're seen
all over everywhere on this planet. This series started when you guys asked me to
start looking up certain locations, and I thought this would be a fun idea. So, I've since received over 900 locations.
I'm working my way down the list. I'm jumping around a little because some of you guys have really asked me, will you
do my hometown next? And so I've I've skipped a little bit and given a few of
you cuts in line. So I know there are some of you still waiting. Let me know
and I will give you cuts, too. But yeah, I've found nine locations that I am
exploring today coming from mostly the United States, but also in the UK. And
these cases include all different types of encounters, close encounters of the first, second, and third kind. So, we
see simple sightings, but also usos, humanoid encounters, encounters that
affect the environment in some way. really the whole range of encounters with all kinds of evidence from
electromagnetic disturbances, physiological effects, animal reactions,
photographs. I love the photographic cases, radar returns, really all kinds
of evidence to support these cases. Many multiple witness cases as well. Few of
these are quite well-known, but I think most you probably haven't heard before. And the nine locations I'm covering
today include Paduca Kentucky, Shakapei,
Minnesota, Wilton, Maine, Doncaster in the UK, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina,
Barkerburg, West Virginia, Mon Georgia, Benelum, Pennsylvania, and finally
Brigantine, New Jersey. So quite a few locations. And of course, I found cases
in each and every one of these places. So, let's just start with the first
location, which is Paduka, Kentucky. And this is submitted by I'm going to try
and get this right. Mikadiddle 51. So, Mikadiddle, this is for you. I found
some really interesting cases in Paduka. I found four cases. Three are sightings,
but one is definitely a close encounter of the second kind affecting the environment, and another definitely has
much deeper levels of contact. I think you'll find it pretty interesting. First
case I found in Paduca occurred at 9:03 p.m. on November 9, 1957.
Two 16-year-olds, Buddy Hicks and Jerry Hower, were driving along Old Mayfield
Road just south of Paduca when they saw a large object glowing blue and red
circling about 500 ft in the air and making a quote shuddering sound. As
Buddy says, it was as big as an airplane. But as soon as this object came into view, their car engine and
headlights went out. They watched it for about 2 minutes, at which point it rose upwards and out of sight. One evening in
August 1993, this date is approximate, a mother and her two children were driving to their home in Paduca. And as they
turned onto their street, they were amazed to see three unusual looking objects floating directly above their
house. And as one of the witnesses says, they were floating in the sky about 100
to 200 feet above our house. They were three gray cylindrical objects that were
slowly rotating in a circle. The cylinders were less than 50 ft in size.
None of us knew what they were. Here's the weird thing. None of them talked about it. But years later, seeing an
episode of Unsolved Mysteries. One of the witnesses asked his mom and brother about the sighting, and they both
remembered it. But it was 31 years after this encounter that the witness finally reported it to the National UFO
Reporting Center. And as he says, to this day, they have quote, "No clue what
it could be." Pretty interesting sighting. And here's another one. It was 4:55 a.m. on November 30th, 2005.
The witness was walking on the north side of the city when he saw four large bright white lights in the sky. They
immediately caught his attention. And as he says, as I got closer, I could see
the outline of the craft. It was a thick triangle with rounded off edges. Under
it were four large white lights, one on the front and one in each corner. It was
a flat black color like a stealth aircraft. It made no noise until I got closer and then I heard a very low
rumble. He estimates it was about 70 to 80 feet wide, 40 to 55 ft across, and 15
to 20 feet tall. That sounds to me like a TR3B,
a reverse engineered military craft, but you can make up your own minds about it.
There's always another sighting. And here's one which occurred on the evening of March 13, 2008. This one's
interesting. A young man woke up from a nightmare and looking outside saw that his yard was illuminated by a very
bright light. As he says, "I then got up to look out the window and was frozen to
see a saucer-like craft with lights going all the way around it in a circle. It moved very slow just above the
treetops. I could have thrown a baseball and hit it." Now, this object made no sound, but the witness says he could
feel a sort of static electric energy coming from it. And as he said, I got
the feeling of needles pricking my skin all over and my heart raced. So he
remained frozen in place, watching this object move off down the street. And as
soon as it was gone, he ran to wake up his father, who told him to quote, "Shut up and go to bed." The witness, not
surprisingly, was unable to sleep the rest of the night. And he soon realized that this encounter had affected him
profoundly in many ways. as he says, "Since that night, my life has changed
in ways that I can't get over. I have since developed sleep paralysis in which
I tend to astral project and sometimes feel like I am being carried off. I
became a music prodigy on the guitar and piano. I have psychic feelings. I also
had a recurring dream that I am hovering over a coffin that is violently shaking.
It opens up and a gray is laying there with its arms crossed. There you go,
Mick Padiddle. Thanks for suggesting this location. Pretty interesting. I
thought that last case was particularly compelling. It's amazing that all over
the world people are seeing UFOs. I don't know how there can still be skeptical people on this planet. I
really don't. I think if any objective person takes even a brief look at the
huge amount of evidence and the number of cases out there, they can only come away convinced. That's just my personal
feeling, but everyone of course has the right to make up their own minds about what's going on here. And now let's move
to a second location. I had a lot of fun with this one as well. This is Shakapei,
Minnesota. And this comes at the suggestion of JR H A T J RH. So JR hat J
RH. Uh at any rate, you know who you are. Thanks for suggesting this location. You know, there's this is not
a small city. Some 47,000 people live in Shakape. It's a fairly
large city. Yet, strangely, I only found a few cases, but I did find some, and I
think they're pretty interesting. All the cases that I found in Shakipi are pretty recent. The first one occurred on
September 2nd, 2005 at around 5:30 p.m.
A man was driving south on Highway 169, just past the exit to Highway 13. You
can see it here. And looking up, this is when he noticed a round silver object in
the sky. Now, he stared at it as best as he could while he was driving, trying to figure out if it might be some sort of
unusual plane. But then it did something which made him realize that it could not be a plane. As he says, "Suddenly, a
bright light came from the object. So bright I was blinded for a second." So he kept looking at the object for about
a minute or less when it suddenly disappeared. A pretty standard sighting.
But here's another one, also very interesting. It was 15 minutes before 1 p.m. on July 24th, 2013 as a witness
drove west along Highway 13. Again, you can see it here. Suddenly, off in the
distance, he saw a strange object in the sky which emerged from a cloudbank. He
said it appeared to be a shiny white sort of cigar-shaped craft, but long and flattish in shape. He didn't think too
much of it at first, assuming it had to be a plane. But after moving across the sky at a quick pace for about 20
seconds, suddenly it came to quote, "a dead stop." And that's when he realized
he was seeing something very unusual. As he says, "You could see it sit still
with the blue sky behind it. It sort of startled me knowing that planes don't stop like that." He says, "It remained
hovering there for about 8 seconds, then suddenly vanished." Here's another case with very little information to it, but
it does have a photograph connected to it. Was on the night of August 24, 2015
when the witness noticed a brilliant glowing orange object in the night sky over Shakipi. He managed to capture a
photograph of it. Now, the witness's coworker submitted this photograph to
the National UFO Center run by George Filer in the hopes that somebody might
be able to identify it. So, here's the photograph. Definitely pretty interesting, but I don't know. You can
make up your own minds about it. Here's one more case in Shakipi. This next case
reported to New Fork, the National UFO Reporting Center, took place at 10:05
p.m. on June 12, 2016. The witness says he was driving along a
major highway in Shakapi when he saw a glowing red orange bell-shaped object
that was floating just a few thousand ft above the city. Per the witness, this object was far too large to be any
conventional object or astronomical body. He could not identify it and after
about 5 minutes it disappeared behind the clouds and was no longer visible. All right, JR at JR. There you go. There
are definitely some cases in Shakipi. Did not know how that's how you pronounce that city, but I looked it up
because I always screw up at least one city name or location. I'm trying to get
better at that. But yeah, how interesting is that? UFOs are being seen everywhere. And now let's move to the
next location. And you almost got me on this one. This is Wilton, Maine. This
turns out to be a pretty small town. This was suggested by Heather Ray. So,
thank you, Heather. You almost got me on this one. Only about 4,000 people live
in Wilton, but I did find a case, and it does appear to be a close encounter of
the second kind, meaning it affects the environment in some way. So, I hope you find it interesting. It was 7:00 p.m. on
October 16, 2014 when a mother noticed that her baby monitor was emitting an
unusual static interference. And she said it gave her a very uneasy feeling
to the point that she shut it off. She then went out with her husband and sat on the back porch while dinner was
cooking. And this is when they had their encounter. As the witness says, I
noticed a string of lights of varying colors a quarter of a mile out, which I then pointed out to my husband. I
immediately asked my husband to turn off the porch light and kitchen light to minimize the light pollution. The lights
kept dimming down and then getting extremely bright and began to rotate and alter color, red and white being the
most dominant. Shortly thereafter, the lights on the craft separated, turned
bright red, and formed a U-shaped arc. Then the lights dimmed. The craft sank
behind the tree line, and a bright white light pierced through the trees. There
seemed to be two of them at this point with no more than 30 ft between them. So
they continued watching this, and finally the craft rose up out of the trees and began rotating red lights
around the perimeter. And this is when they really got nervous and decided to retreat inside their home. So they did
not see this object leave. It was still out there when they went inside. There you go, Heather. Yeah, only one case,
but it is a multiple witness case. And it did have these strange electromagnetic effects as well.
Certainly seems to be a legit case. You know, there are other cases in these locations involving unexplained lights,
but they're so brief, somewhat ambiguous that I don't like to include them. I really like to include cases that are
more credible or involve a solid object, something that we can really sink our teeth into, but by no means don't think
that this is comprehensive. It's very hard to dig deep in some of these areas
because I'm sure that there are other cases going on in Wilton, Maine. But thank you, Heather. That was pretty
interesting. Now, let's move to the next location. This comes by special request
of Von Hunter, and this is in the UK, Doncaster and South Yorkshire, United
Kingdom. Found quite a few cases here. Some really interesting ones. So, thank
you, Van, for suggesting this. I always love traveling across the pond, visiting
England, and seeing what's going on there. And there's a lot of activity and definitely Doncaster has some really
interesting cases. The earliest case I could find in Doncaster occurred at 6:30
p.m. on January 14, 1975 when three 14-year-old boys were playing
in a field behind Victoria Road. This is not far from the Bentley Collery Cricut
Club. You can see it here. Suddenly, the field was illuminated by a white light
coming from above. Looking up into the cloudy sky, they were amazed to see a
glowing diamond-shaped object hovering just below the clouds. There was a white
light blurred around the edges, and in the center was a purple light. You can see their drawings of the object here.
Now, as they watched, this object increased in size, and it looked to the boys like it was going to come in for a
landing. But instead, it did something really unusual. It began to make slow
circles around the sky above them for about 10 or 15 minutes. It made no noise
that they could hear, and at one point, it suddenly wked out, quote, just like a
television being switched off. This is how the boys put it. and the purple dot
in the center was the last to disappear. All the boys felt like the object was
watching them or whoever the occupants were inside it. And in fact, one of the boys was so overwhelmed with fear that
the other two had to almost carry him away from the field. All three boys then
ran home. It was literally just a few hundred feet away from that above case.
And four years later that at 6:30 a.m. on January 4, 1979,
during gale force winds sweeping through the area, Jenny Strut and her two
children, Jane, age 15, and Paul, age 13, were in their house on Roslin
Crescent. You can see it here, the approximate area. But as Jenny says,
quote, "Suddenly, I heard my son Paul crying out. He sounded very alarmed
before bursting into my bedroom, shouting excitedly about some lights in a nearby field. I looked through the
window and I saw some very odd lights hovering over the school playing fields which back onto our house. I rushed
downstairs and was shocked to see a huge saucer-shaped object making a noise like
a Hoover. The top part was rotating. As it turned, it pulsed off a vivid flash
of light. Paul shouted out, "It's taking photos of us." So, at this point, Jenny
ran to call the police, but strangely, the phone was not working. All it would
do was make this high-pitched whining noise. But she kept trying and eventually did get a hold of the police.
By the time they showed up, this object was gone. Paul Strut told the police,
quote, "It frightened me to death. It was massive. The top part looked like it
was taking photos. Every time it turned round in the direction of our house, it sort of made a white flash." Now, Jenny,
the mother, did give an interview to the newspapers who published her case, and this led to them locating another
witness. As Jenny says, as a result of which I was approached by an ambulance
man employed at the local collure who told me that he had also seen the same
UFO that morning but decided against contacting the newspaper, fearing ridicule. So when asked for a statement
by reporters, the Royal Air Force said that they had no planes in the area and
that probably what the family had seen was simply a civilian plane from an
unusual angle. There's the government for you helping out to try to explain
away UFO encounters. Here's another amazing case. Jackie Wright was a
retired electrical engineer and very familiar with advanced machinery. But at
5:00 a.m. on December 5, 1980, he was in his home on Northland Avenue, which you
can see here, when he saw something in the sky he definitely could not identify. And I'll just quote Jackie as
he describes what he saw. Says Jackie, I looked out the window and saw a really
brilliant light that was like a mercury vapor. So whatever this was, it was
stationary in the sky, was semi-ircular in shape, and of quote, dazzling
brilliance. So Jackie quickly grabbed a pair of binoculars and stared at this
object in wonder because it was definitely, he says, a UFO. And things
were getting stranger because, as he says, then I saw two more lights about one quarter the power coming in from
different directions. And to his amazement, the two lights seemed to touch the first object and then wink
out. And he watched this for about three and a half minutes until the object moved vertically straight up and
disappeared. Now, he had never believed in UFOs before this, but this encounter
absolutely changed his mind forever. As he says, I used to laugh about this kind
of thing, and I thought it was a lot of bunk, but when I saw this, I began to think otherwise. He did report it to the
Doncaster Evening Post who contacted the RAF, the Royal Air Force, who of course
said that it wasn't them, that they had received no other reports of UFOs in the area. The next case occurred one night
in midFebruary 1988 around February 25th. Iris Blakeboro was looking out the
patio doors of her home on Bard Road. Now, this overlooks the playfield of
Hawthorne School. You can see it here. And she was amazed to see a large
spherical object hovering over the field, sending down a brilliant light.
And as she says, I'm convinced it was an unidentified flying object. All the
school playing field was lit up for about an hour before it moved off. Now, to her surprise, she saw it again on the
next night and then a third time while driving to the college where she worked. And in fact, her brother also saw it.
She was so impressed by this series of sightings that she contacted the direct investigative group of aerial phenomena
and reported these sightings. There's always more sightings. Here's the next one. The Bessakar family was in their
home on Cantaly Lane. This is on the night of June 2nd, 1997 when a UFO
showed up. Looking out the window, Mr. Bessakar saw a strange light. He
immediately called out to his wife and they both saw it. As he says, was absolutely enormous and the best way of
describing it was like a giant upside down pudding basin. It had really bright lights which stayed on all the time and
must have been gigantic. Within just a few moments, they watched it take off at an incredible speed,
becoming just a tiny speck in the sky, and then it was gone. Now, although it
was a brief sighting, it had a huge impact on him. As he says, "I have
always been skeptical about UFOs, but not after seeing that. I had not been drinking, and I know about low-flying
aircraft because I've been to Finningley Air Show in the past. What I saw was definitely a UFO. I was ecstatic after
seeing it because I knew it wasn't an aircraft. I hesitated a few minutes
before ringing the police because I thought they might take me for a crank, but I think I convinced them it was a
genuine sighting. I am now hoping some other people in Doncaster might have
seen it because it was such a clear night. Unfortunately, it appears that he
and his wife were the only witnesses. But there's always another sighting
because it was around 1:30 a.m. one summer evening in 1998 that Debbie
Scorer stepped out of her home in Stainfor. This is just north of Doncaster and saw something she could
hardly believe. A gigantic triangular-shaped object covered with
lights moving very slowly. She said, not much higher than the rooftops. And as
she says, it looked like a stealth bomber, but it made no sound and moved too slowly. I wasn't scared, just
fascinated. There was also a sulfur smell. So, she told her sister about it,
who encouraged her to report it officially. And when she and her family had a second sighting of an orange
glowing kind of segmented object while driving through town, she decided to go public. Her case was investigated by
Paul Westwood of the International UFO Research Network, who was unable to
identify the craft as anything conventional. And as he says, they seem like honest and genuine people who
sincerely believe what they have seen. There you go, Van. Thank you for suggesting Downcaster. It definitely
delivered. I had no doubt that I would find something there. The bigger the city, the more likely, of course, there
are to be all kinds of UFO cases. But I'm still finding them even in locations
that are not very populated. And this is a very important detail because this means that UFOs are in fact visiting
everywhere on our planet. And of course, the question is why? I mean, we can only speculate, but I suspect that one of the
ET's goals is to basically announce their presence. They are making sure that everyone on this planet has an
opportunity to know about them. Only my assessment, but it sure looks like it.
It seems to me they're putting on a very vigorous publicity campaign. They want us to know that we're not alone. So, now
let's move to the next location. I got quite a few requests for Myrtle Beach in
South Carolina. And this is a pretty active area and had some really unusual
cases. Unusual to say the least. This is by special request of USO7777
as well as Cam McG 2019 and Pette Johnson. So yeah, I
got three requests to cover Myrtle Beach. This is a fairly large
metropolitan area along the coast. 40,000 people make this place their home
the in the greater area and definitely some really compelling and unusual cases. The earliest case I could find in
Myrtle Beach is very brief. It occurred on August 19, 1952 and is one of the
earliest documented sightings in this area. The short news clip on this case says only, and I quote, "A lot of folks
have seen flying saucers, but two North Carolina visitors to this beach resort
say they saw a flying soup plate winging through the sky. At least it didn't look
like a saucer," one of them said. Now, this next case is not in Myrtle
Beach proper, but in Conway, which is really just a few miles inland, and definitely connected to another Myrtle
Beach sighting around the same time. This one occurred on the evening of January 29, 1953,
as Lloyd C. Booth, a former Army intelligence officer trained in
anti-aircraft. He was driving down a dirt road off Highway 701, returning to his family
farm. After eating dinner, he heard the animals outside starting to act up. So
he grabbed his pistol and went outside and to his shock saw a UFO at very low
level. As he says, "It was in front of me, no more than 10 ft above the
treetops, approaching slowly over the clearing beyond. I had never seen anything like it in my life. The
eeriness of it made me feel terribly insignificant. And suddenly I felt as if
I was the only person on Earth. I could see it plainly and could detect a slight
humming noise. It was a light grayish color and lit up on the inside. Now, he
had recently heard of other people in the area seeing UFOs, but had not paid much attention to these reports. But now
seeing this craft, he knew instantly it was a genuine UFO. He said it was about
24 feet long, maybe 14t wide, and about 10 ft tall, very streamlined, and it had
what looked to him like two dark glass windows. But there were no markings of
any kind. No visible means of propulsion. Was hovering and then it moved about 90 feet over his head,
circled around over the forest and came back again. This took about 20 minutes.
And as it went over his head again, Lloyd lifted up his gun and fired it at
the craft. And as he says, I heard the bullet hit the craft. It made a metallic
noise and bounced off. I fired again immediately, but this time I didn't hear
the bullet because the craft suddenly made a much louder noise and took off with terrific speed, much faster than
any craft I've ever seen before. It virtually vanished into the sky. Now,
inside his house, his family had been awakened by the gunfire. So, he told them what happened, and they decided to
keep it private. But he did end up telling his minister, and his minister
blabbed all about it. Word of the encounter spread and he soon learned of other sightings in the area around the
same time, including one by Mark C. Garner, editor of a Myrtle Beach
newspaper and another Myrtle Beach sighting one week earlier. And before long, similar
reports were coming in from all over the place, including Marian and Florence and
from a pilot off the North Carolina coast. Lloyd's encounter generated a lot
of publicity, mainly because he was a reliable military witness and also
because he was the first person known to have ever shot a gun at a UFO. Now, the
next case is one of the cases that were going on at that time, and this again is
Mark Garner, a reporter, and as he says, we saw one of the confounded things. It
was 6:20 p.m. on February 13, 1953. He and his family had just pulled into
their driveway on 25th Avenue when his six-year-old daughter, Jean, shouted
out, "Look, Daddy, look." Now, she's always shouting out at little things like puppies and kitties. So, he didn't
pay much attention until he heard his four-year-old son, Craig, join in. So he
looked up and as Mark says, sure enough, there it was. An object like nothing
we've ever seen before, seemingly round with a brilliant light visible in front
of a grayish or silver oval. Now, when they first saw it, it was coming down
almost like a falling star, but it then swooped down in a huge arc, climbed
slightly, leveled off, and went off behind some houses and trees where it disappeared from view. So, it was only
in view for about 15 seconds, but definitely long enough to convince them that they had seen a genuine UFO.
And it was just three days later on February 16 that EB Bellamy and his son,
Junior Bellamy, were driving home from the Crystal Ice Company where they worked in Myrtle Beach. And this is when
they saw a bright light pacing their car along the highway. It was moving at treetop level, sometimes actually
disappearing below the trees, and it kept reappearing. So, they decided to
keep riding past their house, and they followed this object. They drove to the home of their neighbor, Cecil Patrick,
and got him and his wife to come out and look at it. They then got back in the car with Cecil, and all three men
followed this object all the way to the next city of Socast. Now, Eie Bellamy had worked for 5 years
at the Myrtle Beach Air Base, and he states emphatically that what they saw
was no known aircraft. In fact, this sighting went on for a full 30 minutes
until this object finally went out of sight. Now, the exact date of this next case is unknown. It was one day in 1975,
broad daylight at Myrtle Beach, that the anonymous witness insists he saw a UFO.
As he says, it was just cruising along just within shoreline paralleling the
coast. It was 250 ft above the ground and 750 ft from me. It was saucer type,
approximately 20 ft in diameter. It had a dome at the top center of it and it
made an electrical sound like the hum of a generator. That's what caught my attention. So he watched it for about a
minute or more as it moved slowly out of sight and was gone. This next case from
the National UFO Reporting Center, New Fork, involved unexplained lights. It
was a dark and cloudy evening at 8:15 p.m. on September 16, 2004
when the witness saw quote three blinking lights. He said they were stationary in the sky and formed a
perfect right triangle. Now, as he watched them, they suddenly started moving out to sea. They moved off into
the distance and disappeared, at which point another single blinking light appeared. As the witness says, three
times this UFO let off a light that lasted about 5 seconds. It was an orange
reddish glow that only shot upwards and that was it. Now there are a great many
cases which occur on Independence Day, including this one which occurred on July 4th, 2013.
A married couple were on the balcony of the Camelot by the Sea Hotel, of course, in Myrtle Beach, watching a fireworks
display. Now, the fireworks display ended at exactly 10:10 p.m. and it was 5
minutes later that this couple saw something that they believe was not fireworks. As the witness says, straight
over the ocean, I noticed an orange light that lit up and disappeared a few times. Then, six lights appeared in a
half circle and appeared to rotate and disappear one by one. This next case
comes from Muon field investigator Richard Zachary Harvin and Cheryl Anne
Gilmore. They said they interviewed a witness who on the first week of April 2017 was on vacation at Myrtle Beach
when she noticed a brilliant white orb over the water. It was just a few nights
later she saw another orange orb very close to the water. On this occasion
during the sighting she said her television showed very unusual interference which she connected to this
sighting. Now on another night this orb appeared again. So this time she had her
phone camera ready and took a short video clip of the orbs. You can see a
still from this video clip here. So pretty interesting photographic case.
Here's another case investigated by Cheryl Anne Gilmore which occurred at 700 p.m. on March 14, 2022.
A married couple noticed green fuzzy lights over the water. Now, taking a
closer look, these objects appear to be two connected green orbs descending low
over the water. At one point, they darted an estimated one or two miles in
about 1 second. Now, the witness has a background with the NSA. the National
Security Agency. And he says that this object could not be a drone as it was
moving. He estimates about 3,000 mph. Now, before it took off, he did manage
to take a photograph of the object, which you can see here. And as investigator Cheryl Anne Gilmore says,
it is hard to determine what the witness saw from the photo he submitted with the report, but he is adamant there was a
craft. The green lights, he said, were fuzzy around the edges as if they were
reflecting off the object. All right, there you go. That's Myrtle Beach. You
can see that UFOs have definitely visited there. I mean, we've got photographic evidence. How about that
guy shooting at a UFO? He may have been the first, but it's certainly not the last. He's a credible witness. I mean,
this guy was not only in the military, he was trained in anti-aircraft
to identify aircraft. So he did definitely not see a blimp as some
military officials tried to sort of debunk his case. So thank you very much
USO7777 Cam McGee 2019 and of course Pette
Johnson. When there's multiple requests on a location I try to push it up on the
list a little bit because there's more people waiting for it. I'm still trying to go in order, but some of these
locations have a lot of cases and this particular series takes an enormous
amount of research because I've got a huge amount of data to go through to
find all these cases. So again, please be patient. Please feel free to offer
your hometown or any location and I'll put it on the list. But yeah, I've got over 900 locations I'm looking at. But
it sure is a lot of fun. I'm finding it endlessly fascinating and again I always
learn something. So let's go to our next location which is Parkerburg, West
Virginia. What a beautiful state West Virginia is. I've been there a couple of times including recently. It's
absolutely amazingly beautiful. This location was
requested by two of you out there including Dave O and Beverly Green. So,
thank you guys for suggesting Parkerburg. Super interesting. It's a
midsize town of about 29,000 people located in sort of the northwest area of
West Virginia along the Ohio River and definitely has some really compelling
cases. The earliest Parkerberg case I could find comes from an anonymous man,
a pilot who at 2:45 p.m. on September 25, 1949
was flying with his wife in a Luskcom 8A. This is a very small plane. You can
see an example here. They were flying at about 3,450
ft altitude just southwest of Parkerburg and moving at about 100 mph.
And suddenly only about 100 ft below his plane and 50 ft to the right, that's
very close, he saw a bright yellow object coming directly at him. He got a
very clear view of it and says it was about the same shape and proportion as
the fuselage of a Lockheed Air Force X90. Here's an example of that kind of
aircraft. But he said this object that he saw was a bright canary yellow. It
had no wings, but he did see what looked like horizontal fins on the back. And he
said in some ways it resembled a rocket. But it was strange because he could see no visible means of propulsion, no
propeller, no exhaust, no smoke, nothing like that. And it moved so quickly that
it passed by him in mere seconds. In fact, his wife did not even get a chance
to see this strange object. Around 9:30 p.m. on August 12, 1956, several
Parkersburg residents saw a round orange silver object darting overhead, making
quote, weird unaircraftlike movements. It was turning at sharp angles, they
said, and finally disappeared off to the east. Two of these witnesses were Arch
Roberts and his wife. Another group was a local newspaper reporter and his family. And they all said that this
object was totally silent, much brighter than any star in the sky. And it turns
out there were other witnesses. Soon other people reported across the state, including in the towns of Belpri,
Vienna, Williamstown, and Harrisville. It was three months later on November 8,
1956 that Raymond Angier said he observed a yellow star-like object which
moved quote peculiarly was racing straight up and straight down
and then would go back and forth. During this time it would blink on and off. So
he grabbed his binoculars, a pair of 7 by 50 binoculars and looked at this object but was still unable to identify
it. All they could say was quote, "The light was not an atmospheric
distortion." Now, here's a case from researcher John Ke. It occurred on
November 2nd, 1966, the same night as the very famous Woodro Darrenburgger
case. That one occurred in Mineral Wells just south of Parkerburg, but does appear to be connected to this one. The
Darrenburgger case is a very long involved humanoid encounter, which has been very well covered elsewhere. Now,
per John Keel, there were two men driving along Highway 77 just outside of
Parkerburg when they saw an elongated cylindrical shaped object descend from
the sky and actually land right in front of their car. So, they stopped their vehicle and watched as a man emerged
from the craft and walked over to them. He looked human. He was wearing a black coat. He had his arms crossed over his
chest and he was grinning widely. and he began to ask them several quote
pointless questions and then returned to the craft which took off. So again, Woodro Darrenburgger describes a very
similar encounter with a grinning man and he ended up having repeated encounters with this same apparently the
same humanoid who introduced himself as Indid cold. He claims to have been taken on board the craft. In fact, he ended up
writing an entire book about his experiences called Visitors from Lulos.
This incredible case was reported to Mufon and comes from a family who was driving through Parkerburg on the
evening of November 28, 1966. They were on the edge of town when they
noticed lights through the trees, which they thought at first might be a forest fire. So concerned, they decided to turn
around and go investigate. And to their amazement, they found that many other
cars had pulled over to watch what appeared to be a fleet of seven flying
saucers. Now, per one of the witnesses, these objects were white in color, shaped very
much like an Eminem candy, and were hovering in place. In fact, he had the
impression that the objects knew they were being observed because they began to perform very unusual aerodynamic
feats. And in fact, they danced around the sky for a full hour, at which point
the object then moved into a quote stairstep formation, and one by one,
they darted upwards and disappeared, each disappearing in the exact same spot. Now, later the witness would have
other encounters, including a missing time incident. But as he says, I feel
blessed to have seen these things, especially the first encounter, but people tend to call you crazy rather
than try to believe it did happen. Anyway, I know and always will know.
This next case involved a wave of sightings and it got an enormous amount of publicity because it involved a large
number of witnesses, including almost a dozen police officers. was October 26,
1978. On that evening, some 11 patrol officers watched quote mysterious lights which
hovered over Parkerburg, forget this, more than 3 hours. Many calls came into
the Parkersburg news station reporting UFOs and of course also to local police
stations. The lights were described as having different colors, including red,
white, green, and blue. The objects were seen over a very wide area, not just
Parkerburg, but all the way up to Johntown, Pennsylvania, where a radio show answered more than 50 calls from
various witnesses who were seeing these objects. They were seen all over West Virginia in Canoa, Morgan, Mason,
Putnham, Cabel, and Ran counties. Some of the witnesses said these lights were
hovering in place. Others said they saw them zipping around at very high speed.
Now, here's where the debunkers come in. Professor HD Bingham Jr., professor of
astronomy at Parkerburg Community College, said that the witnesses were probably mistaking stars or meteors for
UFOs. However, the lights did return over a period of days, and a flight controller
supervisor at the Koa airport in Charleston said that he actually tracked these objects on his radar screen. And
at least one witness, Harlon Burns, said he photographed one of the objects. You
can see the photo here. Harlon says he saw a cluster of lights streaking across the sky. He did a time exposure of these
objects. So definitely some photographic evidence and radar evidence. Probably
not stars. Thank you Dave O and Beverly Green. I had a lot of fun investigating
Parkersburg, West Virginia. I did consider covering the Woodro
Darrenburgger case in more detail, but it's quite well-known and it's such a
long and involved story and so controversial that I decided to just give it some mention. I may cover it in
a future episode because there's a lot to it, but and technically it really
wasn't in Parkerburg. It was outside of it. Close enough, I think, that it could probably qualify. But yeah, there was
definitely enough interesting cases in there. I think in just one location alone, like Parkerburg, there's enough
there to convince a skeptic that something is going on with the UFO phenomena. And as you probably know by
now, I do think that the explanation is extraterrestrial. Not to say that all of the things that
people are seeing and all that's going on doesn't have some other causes and
explanations, but there's no doubt in my own mind, having seen UFOs and had some
really close encounters myself, that a good number of these, probably most, are extraterrestrial in origin. And I just
think it's a mistake to conflate all phenomenon together because yeah, there are some cases that definitely involve
what we would call little people, elves and fairies and gnomes and so forth. And
of course, Bigfoot and other entities, spirits and angels, and you name it. A
lot is going on here on our planet that we don't fully understand. It's why I like doing this research.
So, thank you very much, you guys. I really appreciate it. Let's move to the next location. And this was suggested by
Katherine Jones. You've asked me a few times. You've suspected it's coming up
soon. And you were right, Katherine. We are now covering Mon, Georgia. I had a
lot of fun with this one. I love the state of Georgia. It's so beautiful. So many trees, lakes, and rivers. It's just
so beautiful here. And I found some amazing cases. So, thanks, Katherine. I
hope you find this interesting. I know I sure did. An early Mon, Georgia case
occurred on the night of April 2nd, 1950 when numerous witnesses reported seeing
quote white balls of light. They were flying in a V formation and moving very
quickly at an estimated 1,000 mph. Some reported that they were leaving behind a
mileong vapor trail. Warner Robbins Air Force Base was contacted and they
dismissed these reports as quote, "Too much Saturday night celebrating."
So, that's hardly a serious investigation. What appears to be something unidentified. Now, here's a
really amazing case. This case comes from a declassified OSI message
intercepted from Robins Air Force Base. It was classified, now declassified.
It's on July 9th, 1951 that Lieutenant George H. Kinman Jr. said he was flying
his F-51 fighter plane about 15 miles outside of Mon when he observed a white
colored circular shaped craft. He estimates it was about 10 to 15 ft wide,
had sort of a flat top and bottom, but had rounded beveled edges. Now it came
straight at him in his plane on an apparent collision course and then dove from its position and spun in a
clockwise motion, narrowly missing his plane at a distance of no more than 300
to 400 ft. For an aircraft, that's very close. In fact, he was close enough to
see that it appeared to have an almost cratered surface. There was no visible means of propulsion on this object. In
fact, he tried to pursue it, but couldn't see it. At which point, this object came back and made another
head-on dive directly at him and repeated this same maneuver several
times. At one point, performing actual barrel rolls around his fighter jet. In
fact, it was so close he could feel air turbulence as it whizzed by his plane.
So after nearly hitting him several times, it finally climbed up into the sky and disappeared. The entire duration
of this encounter was about 10 minutes. Reportedly, he tried to take photos of it because all these jets do have
photos, but strangely his camera malfunctioned. One year later, another
pilot case. It was 10:05 p.m. July 30th, 1952. a pilot of a T33 jet was flying at
42,000 ft and says he cited an object near Spartanberg, South Carolina, which
changed in color from blue to amber and then back to blue. He tried to track
this object but lost it after about 10 minutes but was then cited over Mon
where witnesses saw it flashing red lights dimming in brilliance and then zooming upwards appearing to break up
into a cluster of smaller lights. was also viewed by a pilot who was flying on his way to Robins Air Force Base and he
said this object zoomed by his plane as it soared upwards and disappeared. This next case involves a small group of
witnesses, Henry E. Watson, Mr. Ra Edwards, and his wife was 7 p.m. on
March 13, 1955 as these three witnesses were standing at the Sparks Motor
Company lot on 8113rd Street watching the sunset. And this is when they
noticed a round black object in the sky. As Henry Watson said, it was moving much
faster than a supersonic jet and it made no sound whatsoever, says Henry. It
appeared to be very high and to our site it was about 12 in in diameter, but of course must have measured more than that
actually. Now, he never believed in UFOs before this, but now as he says, but I'm
fixing to change my mind now. The witness in this case was near Laneir High School in Mon when at 7:30 p.m. on
November 22nd, 1955, he saw a pretty much classic flying
saucer maneuvering along at about 1,000 ft over the school. That's pretty low.
He said it was long. It had a kind of pointed front, but it definitely had a dome on top. And he could see a bright
light coming from the center of the object and little lights around the edges. He said it was going way too fast
to be an airplane. A pretty typical sighting. Here's another case which is so
interesting. It's sparse on details, but wow. Per a truck dispatcher at an
Atlanta terminal, he said that three separate truck drivers coming into Atlanta from Mon around 1 to 1:30 p.m.
on November 8, 1957. Each of these truckers reported seeing a
red egg-shaped object actually on the highway. Each trucker said that as they
approached this object, which was described as about the size of the moon, it would disappear from view. So,
something was definitely going on on this highway between Atlanta and Mon.
Here's another amazing case. One year later, July 23rd, 1958, witnesses at
Robinsfield were amazed by the sudden appearance of a huge wingless craft
streaking overhead, leaving what looked to them like a multicolored vapor behind it. That alone is amazing enough, but it
was shortly after this that this object was seen by two pilots at 2:45 a.m. on
July 24th near Montgomery, Alabama. That case became known as the child's witted
case and received nationwide publicity and remains a classic to this day. Just
over one year later, on the night of October 5, 1959, more than, get this,
500 people in Mon saw what they described as unidentified multicolored
lights moving erratically at varying speeds, somewhere between 5 and 6,000 ft
elevation. This went on for several hours. I'm surprised this did not get
more publicity. In fact, officials at Robins Air Force Base also spotted the objects just north of the base, but they
said that they did not see anything on their radar scopes. This next case
involves actual humanoids in a landed UFO. It comes from a witness who has
experienced UFO ET contact her entire life, including this one profound
encounter in 1973 at age 16 in Mon. As
the witness says, I remember it was night and I heard a voice telling me which direction to leave. I went outside
next to the woods where I saw a being waiting. I was led deep into the woods to an area where I saw a large saucer
with beings standing in front of it. I was told to wait there a distance from the craft. The being who had led me
there went over to the other beings and then another one came back. He was very
friendly to me and I liked him. I don't remember what he said, but it was a very pleasant experience. I don't remember
what happened after that. The year of 1973 turned out to be pretty active. On
September 6th of that year, numerous police officers in Mon started to report
seeing UFOs. One of the more vocal officers was patrolman Dennis Brown, who said that at
400 a.m. on September 6th, he was at the intersection of Waterville Road and
Reigns Avenue. You can see it here. when he saw no less than four strange craft
and in fact he used the 10 power scope of his rifle to get a really good look at him. He called out other officers and
was soon joined by about a dozen other policemen who came to this same intersection and also viewed these
objects. One of the officers had kitted all the others who were seeing these UFOs, but after looking through the
scope, he shouted out, "We'll all be damned." The objects themselves were
dark but did have yellow white blinking lights on them. And the officers watched them until dawn when finally these
objects disappeared. They made no claims about who or what is inside these objects saying that maybe it's secret
government craft or possibly extraterrestrial. But a lot of officers were having
encounters. Another was officer Robert Barerth who says that he and his partner
Hathaway were driving northeast on a Kisby road when his partner looked up in
the sky, turned to him and said, "Mike, there is one of those things up there now." As Officer Barth says, "I thought
he was kidding. I saw it. I knew it was there, but I just couldn't believe it."
So he called it in and very quickly other officers throughout the area started looking up and they saw it too.
Soon there were at least seven officers viewing these objects which had red,
blue and green colored lights. And as Robert Barrett says, "Yes, I believe in
UFOs. There has got to be something to them." And officer Dennis Brown agrees.
He says, "I'll go against any man who says these things are a planet or a scrap of metal falling from space." So
many cases. On the night of April 3rd, 1980, numerous people saw a glowing
object hovering over the August to Makin Railroad heading towards Mon. This
object was One of the witnesses was James Balkam who said he saw a quote blinding light. He actually thought it
was a train, but then realized that no, this was a sphere about the size of a
two-story house 300 ft in the air. In fact, it was hovering directly over the
home of Benton and Mildred Evans. Now, unknown to James, both Benton and
Mildred saw it, too. In fact, they were close enough to hear a strange hissing noise. They estimated it was at least 50
feet in diameter or bigger. They actually called James Balkam and said,
"You should look at this thing." And he says, "Oh, I see it." Now, numerous other people in the area also started
reporting seeing strange lights. Here's an interesting but brief case that does involve a photograph. This occurred on
February 5, 2018. As the witness says, I was outside and I felt kind of strange
and looked up to notice the round sphere, bright reflecting metallic surface hovering over a cloud. Its
shadow can be seen on the cloud beneath it. Now, the witness said she thought or
felt that there were markings on this object. At the time she was looking at it, she kind of weirdly dismissed it,
but did manage to take some footage of it. And you can see the clip here of the video she took. Here's a final brief
case which occurred on April 8, 20119. The witness saw what he thought was a
meteorite. However, the problem was there were actually two of these things and they were perfectly diamond shaped
and they made a kind of slow descent and were trailing what looked to him like a
bluish flame. Again, not a lot of information to it, but certainly interesting. Well, there you go,
Catherine. I hope you found that interesting. Thanks for suggesting Mon. I meant to mention that Mon is a pretty
large city. It's got some, let's see, 150,000 residents. So, I'm not surprised
to find quite a few cases. But honestly, and I said this earlier in this episode,
this is not comprehensive. You could probably times the number of cases I'm presenting for each
location here by 10, 100, or even a thousand. Again, most people don't even report their encounters, but I'm
skipping over the ones that involve just anomalous lights that are somewhat ambiguous or very brief or don't provide
a whole lot to add to our knowledge of what's going on here. So, again, not comprehensive.
Now, let's move to the next location. And this location is Benelum,
Pennsylvania by special request of Robert Cooney. Thank you, Robert. I know
you're a avid watcher of this channel, so I really appreciate your patience uh
for getting to this location of Benelin and it's really interesting. A pretty
large city, 62,000 people in Benelin Township, which is the
largest in Bucks County. And it turns out it's the 10th largest municipal area in Pennsylvania. So there it's no
surprise that there's some really interesting encounters. There was one here so interesting apparent landing
with a humanoid and this one involves apparently this UFO Bigfoot connection
that we rarely see but turns up fairly consistently. I at least 50 or 100
reports of this and there's one here in Benelin. So I hope you find this interesting, Robert. Thank you again.
The humanoid cases are so interesting and this one is really amazing. It comes
from Paul G. Johnson, author of Chasing the Elusive Pennsylvania Bigfoot. On the
evening of August 27, 1973, Allan and LZ Waywright were sitting on
the back porch of their home in Benelum enjoying the cool night air and just
watching the stars. And this is when Allan first noticed something strange. In fact, he dropped his feet to the
floor and said, "What the?" Elsie, his wife, looked up at the sky
where he was looking, and she gasped because they could both see a large boomerang-shaped craft glowing with blue
light around the edges. It was immediately obvious to both of them that this was not a plane. Suddenly, it
stopped moving and hovered in place. Then it shot forward across the mountains. Then started to zigzag
towards the direction of beach hill and dropped below the treeine, but they
could still see the glow from this craft coming from the ground through the trees. And Allan asked, "Did that thing
land or crash?" And his wife Elsie replied, "I don't know. I don't know what it was." So Allan decided to go
investigate. He didn't think it was a UFO. He didn't really believe in them. He thought it might be a new secret
government craft and that the pilot might need assistance. So he grabbed a flashlight and a shotgun and told his
wife Elsie to go inside and locked the door and he set off towards this craft
near Beach Hill. So still thinking it's a government craft, he hiked over there,
got close to the object, and suddenly he felt the hairs rising up on his neck.
And at that point he heard a branch snap loudly behind him. He whirled around and
shone his flashlight and he now saw a 6- foot tall figure with he said beady
black eyes that were blinking from the light of his flashlight. So he raised the beam of his light to the creature's
face saw that it was not human. It was very hairy and had a doglike face. This
creature took a step towards him and Allan reacted instinctively. He raised
his shotgun and fired one shot at this creature. This creature immediately ducked into the brush and Allen
understandably ran home at high speed. Here's a very unusual photographic case
which occurred in October 1975. In a letter to J. Allen Highneck some
years after the incident, James D. Alpman said that in October of 1975,
he had started to notice two unusual star-like lights over his home. One
evening, he noticed a glowing X shape above the moon. So, he decided to take a
photograph of it and then just filed it away. And again, some years later, about
five years later, he was going through J. Allen Heinik's book, The UFO
Experience, and saw a photo that matched the one he had taken almost exactly.
So, this is when he wrote a letter to J. Allen Heinik. And you can see both photos here. And yeah, they're
remarkably similar. So, pretty interesting. Two years later, at 7 p.m. on November
17, 1977, this case is really amazing. A mother
and her three daughters, aged 13, 11, and six, walked out of their apartment
in Benelum to take a drive. And this is when immediately her eldest daughter
pointed out a strange orange light in the sky. The mother kept her eye on it
as they drove up the I95 to visit another family member, and they immediately began driving back home down
the I95. It was now 7:30 p.m. and the eldest daughter pointed out that same
light again, which now seemed to be pacing their vehicle. So, they pulled off the freeway and drove up to their
apartment and they were shocked to see that this object was now very close. And
in fact, as the mother says, there above my apartment sat an object about 30 feet
above. It looked like it had two high beams, but no light was cast forward as
in a car headlight. It appeared to approach us, but neither of us were afraid. All of a sudden, it
was right in front of my windshield, although we did not see it travel towards us. It got to my car in about
two seconds. It had three lights on the bottom, one in the front, and one in the
back. The witness stopped the car, hung out the door, and looked up while her
daughter excitedly exited the car and actually jumped up on the hood to look at this thing. And as the mother says,
above me was a circular metal craft with a definite top and bottom, but no seams
to separate them. It was the length of my station wagon, 15 ft above my station
wagon, so she could see no doors, no openings or markings of any kind. This
craft was moving at just a few miles per hour and appeared to be rocking back and forth slightly and was making a soft
whooing noise. Suddenly, it took off at very high speed. So, they went home and
she called the local military base and reported the sighting. The officer thanked her for the report and said that
they might get back to her. Now, that night after her daughter took a shower,
she pointed out three unusual marks on her stomach. And it was then, just 4
hours after the sighting that the military base called her back and said that they would send over two agents
from a UFO reporting center. These two men arrived and to her amazement, they
had two thick albums filled with various UFO photos and wanted her to look
through them to identify what she saw. She finally did see a photo that matched what she saw, but she now believes that
these were in fact government agents because she tried to locate the UFO
reporting center that they said they were from and it didn't exist. And it was following this sighting that
the mother began to sense strange presences in her room. Her youngest daughter also reported that someone or
something came into her room and she felt that they were trying to pull her out the window, but she doesn't remember
anything after this. So, this definitely appears to be more than just a simple sighting.
A final and very short case occurred in January of 1989. The witness is Bob
Gardner himself, a Muon field investigator, and he says that he and his ex-wife were driving along Nights
Road when they saw a black cylinder-shaped object which began to follow their car. They watched it for a
short time. It then hovered and flew off and was gone. There you go, Robert.
Those are some of the cases in Benelin, Pennsylvania. You know, I get a little impatient
because you have so much data to go through, so many newspapers, so many
journals and magazines and books and websites that I'm sure I could find more
if I was just a little bit more patient. But I I run out of time each time I do
these hometown episodes. They are a lot of work, but that's going to I can't
really call it work because I am having fun and I'm always learning something. It's so interesting. So, thank you,
Robert. And guess what? I'm going to cover another location that you
suggested. So, you get two, Robert. This next location is Brigotine, New Jersey.
So, yeah, suggested by Robert Cooney. Thank you, Robert. This is a tiny little
island town off the coast of New Jersey. About 7,600 people, pretty densely populated. But
there was some really interesting cases. One in particular was like, wow. So, I
think you'll find this pretty interesting, Robert. I certainly hope so. And let's get started. It was around
4:30 p.m. on October 16, 1953, when Emerson F. Morris, aka Slim, he was a
delivery driver for the Colonial Liquor Store in Brigantine. And he was at the corner of 13th Street and Brigantine
Street. You can see it here when he saw a large rounded cylindrical shaped object, white or silver in color, come
in silently and at very high speed from the ocean towards the land. It then
proceeded to emit several smaller discshaped objects from both ends of
this huge, apparently mother ship. These discs were white. They rotated
counterclockwise and moved very quickly. They rapidly sped away, and after it was
finished releasing all these little craft, this object sent down a brilliant cone-shaped beam of white light to the
ground, which was bright enough to hurt Emerson's eyes, and it took off. He
later learned that a lady about a half mile away, also on the island, saw the same event. Emerson ended up writing a
letter about this to Bill Nash, a pilot who had gone public with his own very famous sighting, the Nash Fortenberry
sighting. Local newspapers heard about the incident and tried to interview
Emerson Morris, but he refused all requests of interviews for fear of being
ridiculed. Another less dramatic, but still interesting case occurred on September 26, 2015. The witness said
that he started to notice fiery looking orbs flying back and forth in perfect silence in the night sky over
Brigantine. Sometimes these objects would dematerialize, fade out, or pulsate with brightness.
And a few times it seemed to him that these orbs would morph into the appearance of conventional craft, almost
as if they were sort of mimicking normal airplanes or helicopters. Then on one
occasion he noticed several of these objects darting around in the night sky. It was weird because strangely nobody
else seemed to notice or care about them. So after seeing them over and over again on September 26 he decided to ride
his bicycle down to the beach and sure enough he saw more of these orbs. He showed them to his father who's also
impressed enough to pull out his cell phone and capture them on video. So, you
can see a clip of the cell phone video here. And yeah, these are these glowing
fiery red orbs. A final case, August 11, 2019. It was 3 a.m. when an anonymous
witness noticed a quote glimmer in the sky. And looking up, he could hardly
believe his eyes. He saw a long cigar-shaped object dark in color. It
had a slight aura or haze around it, but he saw it mostly in silhouette, as it
was very dark against the sky, but did reflect the moonlight, and as the witness says, it was not a plane of any
kind, and much too fast for a blimp, though its dimensions could be explained as such. There's not a doubt in my mind
that this was a craft. And it would be near impossible to see if not just happening to be looking at the stars in
the exact location of its flight path. There you go. That's the UFO activity in
Brigotine, New Jersey. This little island town. Again, very densely populated. I love that first case. It's
just so different, so compelling with this mother ship releasing what appears to be smaller craft darting all over the
place. And not only one witness, too. And a photographic case as well. I love
the photographic cases. It's often said a picture is worth a thousand words. I think that's especially true when it
comes to UFOs because they're very hard to describe. Witnesses are often at a loss of words to describe exactly what
they're seeing. So when we have photographs, it's not only provides evidence, but it helps us to visualize
exactly what people are seeing. So there you go, nine new locations all over the
United States and also England where people are seeing UFOs, not only seeing
them, but being affected by them physically, landings, humanoids, all
kinds of evidence to support it. I think that even just one of these Hometown
episodes should be enough ammunition to basically convert any skeptic. So, in
my mind, I mean, it's way past time to still be skeptical of the UFO phenomena.
Uh, the ridicule and gaslighting that witnesses endure is just not acceptable.
This coverup has to end. And I think we're seeing it collapse under the weight of its own lies. It's one of the
reasons I do this research that because I personally just find it interesting and for all you out there who are
looking for good valid information on this subject because as you know I do
dig deep into each of these cases, provide the sources and try to present
it as objectively and truthfully as I possibly can. So thank you guys. Thank
you very much for tuning in. I truly appreciate it. I absolutely wouldn't be
doing this if it wasn't for you. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard
questions, keep searching for the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun.
And I will see you next week. Bye for now.
