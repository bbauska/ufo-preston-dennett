THREE HOURS ONBARD A UFO
Dec 24, 2021

Summary:
Dec 24, 2021
On June 15, 1965, fourteen-year-old Ron C. of New Kensington, Pennsylvania spent the afternoon skateboarding with his two friends. At 7:00 p.m., they had just returned to Ron's home when a huge flying saucer appeared overhead. All three boys stared upward in amazement as a window opened in the craft, revealing the silhouettes of two human-looking figures gazing down at them. Other people around town had recently reported seeing UFOs, and now Ron realized that he and his friends were seeing an actual alien craft.

Ron was overcome with awe, and he thought to himself, how wonderful it would be if he could take a ride onboard the UFO. He lifted his arms and began waving at the UFO people, mentally asking them if they would take him onboard.

So began an adventure that would affect Ron for the rest of his life. His benevolent experience with human-looking extraterrestrials was his first and most profound encounter, but it would be followed by many other sightings. As he grew up, got married and had children, his entire family would become involved. 

Ron's onboard UFO encounter lasted three full hours. And although he doesn't remember everything that happened, he remembers enough to provide him with some interesting and unusual insights into the nature of UFOs and the people who pilot them. According to Ron, humanity will be experiencing some profound and world-shaking revelations that will forever change how everybody thinks about the UFO phenomenon.

Ron's account is one of fifteen cases presented in my book, "Onboard UFO Encounters." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal 
i call this episode three hours on board a UFO this case comes from a gentleman by the name 
of ron he's from new kensington pennsylvania and was 14 years old when he had an incredible 
encounter and was taken on board a UFO where he met human looking extraterrestrials this is quite 
different from most of the cases I receive and I think you'll find it quite interesting 
so let's just get started it was around 7 00 p.m on june 15 1965 when 14 fourteen-year-old 
ron was hanging out with his two friends who I call peter and stephen this is not their real name 
on this occasion they were skateboarding in the alleyway behind ron's house unfortunately both 
peter and stephen had curfews and had to be home by sunset which at that time was around 7 00 p.m 
so darkness had just fallen and now that they had reached ron's house all three 
boys were about to go home and this is when ron noticed a flying saucer a classic disc 
hovering just above the large elm tree at the far corner of the lot near his house 
and ron shouts out look and all three boys stare upward at this object 
at the time there had been rumors of UFO sightings in the neighborhood so they were pretty excited at 
what they were seeing and as ron says this thing had my full attention and I wasn't about to let 
it out of my sight for a second afraid that it might disappear before my eyes as I shouted for 
joy at it I examined it closely it was beautiful according to ron this object was quite large about 
200 feet in diameter he estimates it was dull bluish gray in color it appeared to be metallic 
and there was a light underneath the craft a red light with sort of bumpy texture like 
a bike reflector is how rod described it and it was pulsating from bright red to a deep dark red 
at about half second intervals but what was most interesting to ron about this craft was a window 
which appeared on the front dome of the craft as ron says I could see into it through a 
window that looked as if the blue grey metal had opened up by making that part of it transparent 
there were no hard edges or frame like a regular window it was as if it was all part of the ship 
but part of it was see-through so looking through this transport parent section of the craft ron 
could see two dark silhouettes of human looking figures as ron says they appeared human one was 
taller than the other I could only see silhouettes though I could only see them from the waist up 
they didn't look like the grays so often described they looked like regular humans peering out at me 
ron quickly raised his hands and started waving at them and felt a really strong connection to them 
as he says I thought they were reading my mind 
and that I was being acknowledged when I waved my hands to get their attention 
they seemed to acknowledge me and my friends and I felt a peaceful feeling about them they 
made me feel very comfortable as if they were my friends and would not harm me 
so ron turned to look at his friends to make sure that they were seeing it and they were looking up 
at it but they did not acknowledge him which was quite strange as ron says they were gazing up at 
it also I commented to them we are actually seeing a real UFO they looked as if they were paralyzed 
they didn't move at all and were just staring up at it I couldn't understand why they weren't as 
excited as me they were transfixed on it but did not comment they just stared at it with a blank 
expression I kept saying to them it's a real UFO do you see it but they wouldn't answer they just 
stood there as if hypnotized and I was so excited about it that I didn't let it bother me much 
so ron turned his attention back to the craft and started waving at them and was thinking to himself 
how cool it would be if they would take him for a little ride on board the ship as ron says 
i wave with both hands thinking in my mind that I wanted them to take me for a ride 
i really did want to ride in it and I knew that they knew what I wanted I wanted to ride 
so bad I practically begged them I stood there about a minute or at least it seemed like a minute 
i could see both my friends on either side of me still just staring up at this beautiful object 
then the next thing I remember is watching this UFO leaving me I was completely turned around 
facing the opposite way waving goodbye to it my two friends were now together to the right of me 
still looking into blank space as I was waving goodbye at it they were facing the same way as 
they were in the beginning still gazing but this time it was empty space they were just staring up 
at nothing as if they were paralyzed the UFO was now smaller because it was higher up in the night 
sky I thought it was very strange because I was facing a different direction than my two buddies 
i could see them out of the corner of my eyes I was waving goodbye at it 
i didn't want it to go I heard them say goodbye to me in my mind as if they knew I needed that 
so in a matter of seconds this object quickly accelerated out of sight 
so fast that it left only a tracer of multicolored light curving upward into the sky and it appeared 
to run as if it disappeared behind the moon and he was overwhelmed with emotion as this object left 
as he says I knew that I was a witness to the most extraordinary event that I would ever see with my 
two eyes I was very saddened by the UFO leaving but also at peace as I waved goodbye to it it 
was a lonely type of feeling as if saying goodbye to good friends I felt very satisfied and yet sad
so ron was absolutely excited and immediately turns to his friends and says did you see that 
and steve and peter looked at ron like he was crazy and uh they both said see what 
and ron says the UFO didn't you see it and peter said I didn't see anything and steve said me 
there I didn't see anything and ron thought at first that his friends were teasing but it was 
clear they weren't they had no memory of seeing any UFO or the occupants looking out the window 
and at this point peter looks down at his watch and it gets a shock because it's now 
10 pm and he cries out I am going to get in big trouble and ron's like what's wrong you know why 
and peter says it's ten o'clock and steve steve says what I'm gonna get killed for being so late 
because they both had seven o'clock curfews so they turned to run home and ron shouts at them 
i'll talk to you tomorrow I'm going to come over early and talk about it and neither peter 
or steve acknowledged ron and they just took off running home so ron's right next to his house 
and he walks the 50 feet back into his house and tells his mom says you know what's up you know 
what were you doing because normally ron does not come home this late he doesn't have a seven 
o'clock curfew his mom's more lenient and ron has to be home by 10. so she asked him what were 
you doing and he said I was skateboarding with the steve and peter and we saw UFO 
so he tells her the whole story including seeing these figures through the window and even tells 
her about the missing time so his mom is amazed and equally puzzled and sends ron off to bed 
at some point and ron wakes up the next morning and takes off immediately to visit his friends 
and he ran over to peter's house first and peter came to the front door and said he can't talk 
he's grounded not allowed outside for the rest of the day 
ron quickly asked him about the UFO and peter again repeated that he didn't remember seeing any 
ufo and he was not allowed to talk to him or play today so he closed the door so ron was shocked 
stood there on the doorstep disbelieving and ran over to steve's house steve opened the door he was 
also grounded was not allowed to come outside and told ron that he had no memory of any UFO 
so ron was really upset by this as he says I was beside myself I thought I was going crazy 
i ran home I knew I wasn't crazy I knew I saw it and I couldn't deny it it was clear in my mind as 
if it had just happened so he went home and told his mom my friends don't remember seeing the UFO 
and his mom was sitting down reading the newspaper and she looked up and smiled at him and said 
don't worry about it ronnie your UFO made the front page and she held up the newspaper there 
was an article in the newspaper describing how several residents of new kensington pennsylvania 
had watched this apparently the same UFO as it traveled slowly over the town 
so ron was ecstatic he's jumping up and down for joy saying see mom I told you I wasn't lying 
i saw the UFO I really did see it he was super relieved that there were other 
witnesses however looking at the article no one else reported seeing any occupants just ron so 
this was really amazing to him but most puzzling was this three hours of missing time and he had no 
memory of what happened at least not at first and this is when something amazing happened 
ron began to clearly recall the missing hours over the next week or so and each day more images 
and memories would flood into his mind and by the end of the month he had recalled much of what had 
happened on that night and what he remembered was absolutely amazing the ETs had granted his request 
to take him on a little ride on board the UFO he does not remember how he got on board the first 
thing he remembered was finding himself already on board this craft sitting on a 
silver gray colored bench that curved part way around the outer wall of the dome of the craft 
two other adults sat on either side of him and ron turned to them and said hello but neither of them 
responded and both sat just straight ahead staring without moving a muscle as if paralyzed 
and ron looked up across the room and saw what he describes as the most beautiful people he 
has ever seen in his life as ron says one was a man about six feet tall and the other was 
a beautiful woman about five feet eight inches tall they both had on silver gray jumpsuits that 
formed to their body not too loose or not too tight it was all one piece even their shoes were 
a part of their apparel there was no collar to the suit but it went up to their necks she had long 
flowing brownish blonde hair down to about one third of her back it was shiny and very 
pretty to look at she was very pretty and she smiled at me and he was very handsome 
and had blondish colored hair they both had very blue eyes that were warm as they looked at me 
both of them looked perfect to me they were beautiful to watch and they seemed very friendly 
ron was an absolute awe their jumpsuits he said were completely seamless and shimmered brightly 
in the light from the UFO there was no apparent light source the interior of the craft was just 
brightly lit and both of these figures stood side by side near a 
opening a doorway and the gentleman was waving his hands over what appeared to 
be some sort of instrument panel and at this point the woman stepped forward so ron 
immediately stood up and she approached as ron says she came around and I walked up to them 
she gave me a hug which made me feel very welcome and he shook my small hand I was very comfortable 
there they were very friendly almost as if they were relatives of mine I thought in my mind they 
must be married they seemed to love what they were doing they also seemed to love having me on board 
i didn't say anything to them it seemed as though they knew my thoughts and I knew theirs 
they appeared to me to be perfect people I could not see one flaw in their faces 
they seemed very happy with each other when they looked at me they always looked contented 
and that they enjoyed what they do I felt very comfortable and at ease 
and I knew they would not harm me in any way that they just wanted to please me 
so ron looked around the room was pretty sparsely furnished there wasn't much to it 
it had rounded blue gray walls it was very brightly lit very clean at this point the woman 
stepped back to the instrument panel and waved her hand over it and this was just a very simple panel 
there were no visible dials or switches that ron could see but he was amazed at what happened next 
the gentleman looked at ron and motioned for him to move over to the left and as ron says as I did 
i could see a window was panoramic in shape and about waist high maybe four feet by 15 feet across 
i thought immediately this is where I saw them from the ground 
looking at me and ron at this point realized that they these figures had made the wall of the craft 
transparent by manipulating the control panel and so ron looks out the window and is absolutely 
awestruck at what he sees as ron says it was wonderful I could see stars millions of them 
they were very clear clearer than I've ever seen them I walked closer to the window I felt as if 
i were watching a movie in a movie theater but it was much more clear I felt like I could touch 
the stars as they slowly moved across my view I knew we were moving in outer space we must have 
been going very fast because the stars moved to the left and right of me as we went forward 
they were like diamonds I didn't know what part of space I was in and I really didn't care it had all 
my attention I glanced back at the two humanoids and they just smiled at me I kept looking out the 
window thinking I'm really taking a ride in a UFO I was so exhilarated and felt very special 
i knew I was now in this UFO and the pilots were giving me the right of my life I was so excited 
i just felt at peace that these two beautiful people were answering my request
so at this point ron's memory did get a little hazy he's not sure but he thinks something 
happened that he can't quite remember what he does remember next uh I'll let him describe 
in his own words as he says the woman and the man were still by the panel on the wall 
this time only the woman was waving her hand over the panel and the next thing I remember 
is being on the ground waving goodbye to them not wanting to leave I didn't even think of my family 
then I was so caught up in this great venture I was taking I know that there was much more but I 
cannot remember anything else that happened during my three hour ride maybe one day I will I just 
know that this will never leave my mind and I will cherish it always I often remember this incident 
over and over again and to this day it is still very clear in my mind I know there are many other 
worlds out there and these were two beings from one of them who chose me to give them a ride why 
i don't know except in my mind I felt they were doing me a great service and enjoyed my company
so this was ron's incredible UFO encounter and I have to say I've never heard one quite like it 
uh and it was very very friendly and benevolent something he cherished for the rest of his life 
he grew up became married had kids and did have several other close-up UFO sightings as ron says 
since then I've seen UFOs many UFOs some golden and egg-shaped some ball shaped 
my children have also seen them many times my daughter had a very close encounter with the 
bluish UFO that came right down the street it flew right over her and my wife only about 10 
feet above their heads most of my family has had many sightings but none quite as intimate as mine 
nevertheless they have seen them up close and are convinced of extraterrestrial life
so this experience absolutely transformed ron he became a very deeply spiritual man and has a 
very strong religious faith and he's absolutely convinced that the beings he saw were perfect 
beings and perhaps even angelic and that the UFO phenomena and religion and god are all connected 
as he says I know they exist I know who they are and where they come from I also know more about 
them probably than most people know being very religious I always wondered how god 
and UFOs or aliens are related they are not all as friendly as my experience has been 
but they do have an agenda there are many types of aliens most are just visiting and looking while 
others are more aggressive one thing I can say for sure right now is that they are all kept under 
close watch and scrutiny and are allowed only so much interference with this earth so ron believes 
that more answers will be forthcoming he has had further recall I talked to him following 
this event many years later I wrote about ron's case in my book on board UFO encounters and uh 
talked to him following this the publication of the book and he says he has recalled other stuff 
and he's thinking about writing about it but he believes that there will be a future event coming 
to us to all of people on earth and that many answers will be revealed and that this is all 
tied in to god jesus religion and the whole UFO phenomena as ron says most will wonder what jesus 
christ and god have to do with aliens and other worlds the answer is simple everything I can tell 
no more most will have to find out for themselves but the truth is out there I guarantee it
so there you go ron believes that UFOs the ETs he saw are connected to the angelic realm I do know 
that some people believe that ET's are demonic and it makes perfect sense that uh if that's true in 
any way that someone be angelic as well so I don't know I think extraterrestrial theory is still the 
most logical theory that really explains the best evidence but I have to respect ron's experience 
and his interpretation of it it was his experience after all and it's a very interesting encounter 
and I'm very honored that he shared it with me and it's a really wonderful case of a benevolent 
encounter with human-like ET's and that's why I wanted to share it on this episode today so that's 
it for now I hope you've enjoyed this episode once again I really appreciate you watching and until 
next time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
