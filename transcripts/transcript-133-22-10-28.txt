INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACTEE PART IV: WORLDS I HAVE SEEN
Oct 28, 2022

Summary:
Oct 28, 2022
In January of 1973, a fourteen-year-old girl named Dolly Safran woke up to the fact that she was having regular visitations with extraterrestrials. Prior to this, she had ignored, denied or explained away her encounters. But now, after a profound onboard UFO experience, she knew the truth. She was a UFO contactee. She was having regular visits with extraterrestrials. 

This began her lifelong relationship with ETs, during which she was taken onboard and taught many subjects, including biology, astronomy, chemistry, morality, ethics, spirituality and much more. Given the opportunity to work directly with them, Dolly chose to focus on learning how to fly the craft.

Dolly was visited more than a hundred times each year, and she began having mind-boggling adventures with the ETs. Among the most startling and amazing, was being taken beyond our solar system to visit other worlds.

In Part One of these interviews, Dolly shared her childhood experiences up to age fourteen. In Part Two: Dolly presented the incredible photographic evidence she was able to obtain. In Part Three, she talked about the many different kinds of ETs she has visited. Now, in Part Four of this ongoing series of interviews, Dolly Safran shares her incredible ventures of travelling to other worlds.

Dolly has had the wonderful opportunity to visit many of the worlds within our own solar system, but even more astonishing are her visits to many planets orbiting other suns. One such visit involved a trip to a small rocky world that was nearing the end of its life-cycle. Dolly was taken there with several other contactees and was shown firsthand how every world goes through various evolutionary stages, finally resulting in the death of that planet.

On several occasions, Dolly was taken to a massive water planet whose surface was almost entirely oceans, but was dotted with countless small islands. It was a planet filled with life of all kinds, and there Dolly learned that there was a symmetry to life throughout the universe, and that the flora and fauna on each planet followed a basic template. The planet was also home to at least two intelligent species of humanoids. Dolly was able to meet them both and even became good friends with a human-looking ET girl.

More adventures followed. Over a period of many years, Dolly was taken repeatedly to a planet that was being slowly consumed and destroyed by its own sun, which was in the process of going nova. On the final visit, she was taken to see the world become torn apart and the sun explode into a fantastic supernova. 

Dolly describes her visits to many other worlds, gas giants, water planets and more. Among the most fantastic were her visits to massive alien Dyson Spheres, huge artificial planetoids constructed by the ETs and used as waystations and outposts. Dolly was taken inside and shown how the ETs preserve countless species of both plants and animals from across the universe.

Dolly also shares how she was given the unique opportunity to visit the Voyager Space Probes and get a close-up view of these human-made spacecraft traveling far beyond Earth.

Finally, Dolly shares how she was given a front-row view to one of the most historic and dramatic astronomical events in the history of our own solar system: the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy with the planet Jupiter. While astronomers on Earth viewed the event through telescopes, Dolly was taken onboard a UFO craft and saw the comet collision occur right before her very eyes.

These are just a few of the many events Dolly has experienced with the ETs. Her lifelong experiences include many other adventures and explorations that have taken her to the farthest reaches of the known universe. If you'd like to learn more about Dolly's experiences, her account is told in my book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure." Now available!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
got a very exciting episode for you today I'm going to continue my series of interviews with 
Dolly saffron who is the main witness to my book symmetry A true UFO Adventure as you may 
know I have done three previous interviews with her today is part four and I call it 
interview with a fully conscious UFO contactee part four planets or rather worlds I have seen 
and uh the three previous episodes part one was The Awakening and that talked about how Dali woke 
up to UFO contact and her experiences all the way up to age 14. part two was called the photographic 
evidence and that presents a lot of the photos and films that Dolly has been able to capture 
and uh that helped validate her experiences and part three was extraterrestrials I have met 
so part four today continues this series and I think you'll benefit from watching these 
in order this one will certainly stand alone I really wanted to do this episode today because 
I think it shows some of the more exciting aspects of Dolly's relationship with the ETS and The Many 
Adventures she has had we did cover some of these in the book symmetry but I'm sure we're going to 
learn some new stuff today because that always happens every time I talk to Dolly so Dolly I 
really want to thank you for joining me today it's a huge honor thank you you're welcome my pleasure 
I'm excited because uh yeah I've talked to other people who've seen other worlds as you 
know I did talk to a gentleman by the name of Jay Gardner contacted from West Virginia who 
had an experience pretty much identical to yours being taken to Saturn as a young kid 
and we did cover all of this stuff in part one so I really wanted to talk about some of 
the other worlds that we haven't really had a chance to talk about on air yet 
and one that really intrigues me is because you actually got to land and walk on the surface was 
this small rocky world if I remember correctly with a lighter gravity that was somewhat nearing 
the end of its life cycle is that correct yes it was a planet in a solar system in our galaxy that 
um it was heading in toward its uh star in its uh gravity was being lightened somewhat it was 
a planet that was starting to lose Mass because it was heating up and water was disappearing it 
was getting hotter there every day without gassing and um so I got to see the end of 
the the beginning of it's in the life cycle it would have reached a point when it got too close 
to the Sun that everything would have burned up it would have had molten uh issues with lava and 
volcanic eruptions and things like that and they wanted me to see really close to the end of that 
cycle so we actually landed and we got to walk around a little bit uh the uh we had breathing 
apparatus because the air is really bad and um it was kind of interesting it was extremely hot and 
I it taught me a huge lesson that our planets are volatile that they any change in distance from 
the Sun its size anything can cause this planet to go through unbelievably cataclysmic uh situations 
and this one was right there and that's why I went it was very cool so about how old were you 
I was young I was flying and I was Learning to Fly and I was probably 22-23 somewhere around 
there still making my way through the Galaxy pretty much learning all the ins and outs of 
approaching planets and systems and knowing where I was it was a journey of Discovery 
but it was also a journey for me to learn about how incredibly diverse in our systems are and 
and how each one follows a certain pattern of birth life and death and that was my journey at 
that time all right so you went down with a group of people and grades as well yes 
with talata and probably 30 people who went down um there's probably um five of us were 
um Earth human and the rest were either Grace or tall whites it was a mix and we were all students 
and we were learning well so was this uh an hour long trip or did you stay here we were there
to land and then then we're stasis for a while we can't come out it's even too dangerous for us to 
exit the craft when we're flying like that it's got a lot of radiation around it it's very hot so 
we have to cool down we have to evacuate um what's around it you know give us a chance to get down 
ramp uh then we we proceed to do that and there's like protocols uh for what we do and we stay in a 
group we stay with we have buddy system that kind of thing we're all monitored the whole time we're out and uh we're probably two and a half hours out and we had a way to shade ourselves and we 
had eye gear on and breathing apparatus and we collected um it's not just a oh let's go look it's 
a scientific Expedition as well they're curious about everything so we took samples of things everything is um uh making sure that we understand the science of this as well as they know the 
science of that particular planet in other words they're watching it devolve and uh they want to 
know everything so we helped with that actually so that was pretty cool and so there's life on this 
planet like trees I mean yes what was left and there was some animal life left we took samples 
of everything um it was mostly insectoid um uh type of you know amphibious lizardy kind 
of things not water ones but you know iguana type things weird looking stuff um there were spiders 
there were flies um there were just all kinds of things gnats you name it um they were dying out 
at this point we saw a lot of carcasses and stuff like that but yeah it was pretty pretty messed up 
there for the trees like we would look at here pine trees and oak trees and Birch and so forth 
um it was more like desert plants that were being left there were dead trees everywhere um 
like the area that I was at would have had a very nice Pine Forest but they were all dead by then 
um they were just the carcass of trees you know just falling over desiccating that kind of thing 
um there was some upheaval of the ground you know they would have uh earthquakes and things 
and the Earth would open up in certain places and so we saw some of that we were in an area 
where we had a big level plane to walk around on but you could see off in the distance you know 
things that were going wrong and um they were monitoring the entire time that we were there 
because they were worried about us being in a situation that would have caused the staff to run and so it was a real tight fit for us to be there for a while um was the sky blue no no no
it was uh burnt uh brownish orangish red color maybe yellows you know a lot a lot of very bad 
Vapors in the air no real cloud formations but it was very dense with dust and pollution and stuff 
like that you know Earth pollution it is an oxygen planet or was it was an oxygenated Planet yeah 
any planet that holds life like we know it is going to have a certain mix of oxygen and nitrogen on it and other elements as well like we do 
um that's the only way life is sustainable we're carbon based we have DNA we we need 
water we need nitrogen we need salt that kind of thing and any plant that planet that supports 
life is going to have those parameters and it's like that through the entire universe so what about the sun was it like here on Earth when you just look up at the sky and see the sun 
um yeah it was blinding as I'll get out when I said we had protective eye gear on I'm not kidding we didn't just have lenses over our eyes we had um like little goggly kind of things that were very 
thick and it was bright I mean bright the closer you get to a sun the brighter it gets and the 
Heat's intense I mean you can feel it all over you we were wearing outfits that kind of blocked that you know protected us you know like we have fire uh where that firemen where it's like shiny that's 
the type of suits that we were wearing to protect us from it oh wow so you stayed there for a couple 
of hours yeah yeah total probably total three because it's a half an hour to 45 minutes to cool 
down to get and then we have to get back on to regenerate the engine and get us going on a planet 
that's like that it's a little bit more difficult because we're using twice the power just to get out you know the electricity required is very very high and so it takes them a minute to rev up the 
on battery power at that point until they hit the nuclear part of the engine and then once they do that boom we're out and they go straight up so uh yeah so how was the gravity lighter than Earth yes 
um was it like the moon like I couldn't jump 20 30 feet but it was lighter I could tell it was lighter although it was harder to breathe you know um even wearing uh apparatus that we 
can breathe you feel suppressed somewhat you know because it's it's difficult you know you 
know your breathing contained air that you're breathing from an apparatus um and you worry 
more about it it goes in your brain and you're thinking okay breathe take the breath let it out 
take the breath I mean the whole time I was there I was thinking that it's like going on a dive you know don't forget to breathe don't hit it's like that so could you smell anything 
um you could taste it um when you're on a breathing apparatus you're breathing the air in 
the can okay but if you open your mouth you can it comes through and you can actually taste it 
and it goes to your olfactory nerve and it's very burnt up very dried I've been in Arizona now so I 
know what that smells like we're in Arizona up a couple more hundred times and that would be it you know it's very burnt up smelly so um was this like the only planet in the salt in that solar system 
no no this system had 13 planets actually most of the more gas giant systems the smaller planet and 
it was closer in it's funny there's a there's a pattern in solar systems where there are smaller 
uh planets nearer to the star and then there's a lot of gas giants and then other sizes mixed 
in between um and this was one of four that was close into the Sun and this was the second one to 
the sun it was way further out of it but it was going in I think about it as our past I wonder 
how far out Mercury was in the beginning and how long it took it to get sucked in by the Sun and 
I think that's what I was being taught okay that the first three planets Mercury Mars Venus I mean 
Mercury Venus Earth Mars were the first four okay and I think Venus and Mercury were brought closer 
in over time while we were evolving in a solar system and that's what I was being taught yeah 
well that's basic scientific theory in fact there's many astronomers who believe that there was in fact a planet closer to the Sun than Mercury right and absorbed it correct yes 
so yeah that was so this planet was in what scientists would call the Goldilocks zone or The 
Sweet Spot or just worked for life to evolve or to live I should say yeah all right so very cool just 
one last thing on that so the life you saw like lizards and smaller animals and insects were these 
like you'd see on Earth are completely different or they have nine legs or you know what I mean 
you know there's a there's a uh pattern you know uh 
there's a pattern mathematically and they know that everything's going to have four of something okay very few things have six or eight arachnids have eight um flies have four that kind of thing 
um even six there's some with six but they're mostly insectoid um if it has uh blood in its 
veins it's gonna have a to front to back you know or be bipedal like we are two arms and 
two legs and so they're mostly four limbed um some of them have really fat round tails that absorb uh 
fluid you know in other words like a camel I saw some that looked like I I want to call them camel 
lizards because they were dragging this big ass tail around tail around that was full of fluid and 
it was surviving you know it's how it survived if it found water it drank its tail full that freaked 
me out because I've never seen a lizard like that on Earth ever there's a few salamanders like that and even if you look at a platypus they've got that big tail and I know it's you know capable 
of holding fluids uh yeah oh a platypus yeah oh we won't get into the platypus that's alien itself 
um so were there do you know if there were ever humans or you know sentient Life As 
We would think of it on that planet um I never thought of to ask that question and I've thought about it since then and they said no uh it was an evolving planet that they knew 
would never have enough time for them to plant or seed and it was decided not to even try so 
just let it go let's do what it was going to do so life was very very simple there in a very uh 
smaller animals like lesser developed animals that kind of thing so yeah only got to visit that once 
yeah yeah it was gone pretty shortly after that so it's pretty I mean you know we talk about this in 
the book but it's pretty rare that you get to actually land down and walk on the surface of another planet as opposed to getting to visit one and look out through the windows added yeah I've 
landed on a lot of planets I mean our Galaxy's full of uh habitable planets and they actually 
know um as many of them as they could possibly know and they visit them regularly part of my 
training as a pilot flying with them was to go to different worlds and learn the process 
of contact with them most of the ones I went to were known contact in other words they knew 
who we were they knew what it was all about very well evolved Beautiful People different peoples 
um here we're just sort of backward I think there's only three other planets that I'm aware of in the in our galaxy that are kind of slow Learners and we're one of them right 
and that doesn't surprise me yeah um so did that plan have a name and if it did can you share it 
um I would have to speak their language to name it for you uh I've thought really long and hard about 
this and um no I'm not going to Colorado said don't even waste my time because um I can't give 
you their language it's um we're we've learned to uh our government have learned to use machines 
that make them psychic they're not enabling their own abilities they're using AI to do it and um 
although AI can do it and does they have ai that is psychic that's where they got that technology from they don't want to give out uh languages yet because we don't need to know them not yet 
right now which speaks to what slow Learners we are in terms of at least yeah good mimics
yeah okay with themselves and everybody else around it engine so no I'm not going to give 
you the name no all right so we did talk a lot about you know the Gray's home World already 
uh or you know they live and you spent a lot of time on there that's really cool but another 
planet you we did talk about in the book was sort of a water world and I just got to visit 
that a number of times and there's actually people on that planet you could talk about 
you know that world that you have seen and some of the adventures and studies with that 
okay this is a world that actually people on this planet know about they've been taught um and it 
would be Polynesia the Polynesian peoples know about this world it is what they consider their 
home world and it is not in uh the Pleiades it's beyond the Pleiades in other words it's in this 
galaxy but if you were to go through head toward Orion and go up through the Pleiades and go past 
them deeper into our galaxy it would be right back at the Pleiades in that system and um it 
is in the system of Delphi which is if you're looking at a 3D or 40 or 70 map of something 
you could see that the Delphi system would be high be further beyond the Pleiades and um it 
is a Water World it has land mass on it but not as much as it's got water and there are two types of 
um people's living there one of them actually live in the water and they are not amphibious they're 
mammals like we are they type of humanoid they're humanoid they have DNA human like we do but 
they've evolved in the water and they're very very intelligent they also have bigger brains than we 
do and they have extra hemispheres in their brains that we don't have okay that's how smart they are 
um they are fully psychic they're fully able to manipulate their environment around them and 
um it's interesting to know them um but I spent a lot of time on the land masses and they're very 
Polynesian um there's a girl there that I stayed with when I was on this planet because I got to 
stay for a month at a time when I went and her name was mitcha and she's my age and she helped 
educate me to their way of life in other words she showed me that Evolution doesn't mean you 
have to have a constructed world around you that uh infrastructure is not as important 
as your inner mind and your inner ability and your inner knowledge that knowledge outweighs 
any infrastructure you can put on the ground living sustainably and in an environment healthy 
is their way of living although they're extremely intelligent they can do almost anything they want 
to um they are interdimensional slight Flyers they can if they choose to those that live on the world 
full-time prefer to be there but they're they're scientists they're artists they do many many many 
things but they manipulate and or have evolved to the point that um you really don't need a 
piece of paper or they remember they're fully in contact with what Consciousness really is and that's who they are they just have a physical form stuff and they're very beautiful and anybody 
in Polynesia will tell you that they're gorgeous they're absolutely gorgeous and that's where they came from our people that's some of them the Polynesian people here all right so are they 
like how uh do they have blonde hair and red hair and dark hair and the whole range mostly they have 
the darker hair they look very dark um they're not um they're um what you would call like a tan brown 
color there's their skin they spend a lot of time outdoors and you know they've got a lot of melanin 
going on they have dark eyes they have hazel eyes brown eyes black eyes that kind of thing 
um they uh they they have some peoples have more than 32 or 36 teeth in their mouth they 
have closer to like 42. and um they're more uh they have more of the sharp teeth you 
know the incisor type of teeth like the first four in the front almost like a cat but not really it's they got a lot of sharp teeth in their mouth and that's because they eat food 
um raw and stuff like that they'll eat fish raw they'll eat certain types of meat you know 
that way the cook things too but it's mostly raw food is what they eat and they need those teeth for that they can crunch as well as Spears um do they speak telepathically yes they do they have 
a language um it sounds like Hawaiian to me when I hear it um that's why her name is mitcha and uh 
it's really really cool she tried to teach me a language but I have way too much going on in my head language Wise from here and I it's when I first met her I was learning gray language and 
it screwed with me so I just said nah I know a few words let's put it that way I do have 
something in common with her though I am part of that bloodline I have Asian and I have Japanese I 
have South Korean I have uh um Korean blood I have Polynesian East East Asian blood lines in me and 
um in my name that they call me is that from that world and it's oora and when they came 
there's places that they came to on on this planet several and my name originates from that so with 
them so yeah So when you say this is a water world we're talking just like a saltwater ocean yes salt 
water yep absolutely they do have land masses where there's fresh water you gotta have fresh water to survive humans can't drink salt water at all but they have the technology to desalinate as 
well so it's not a problem yeah they're in regular contact with the ETS on a con ongoing basis right 
all right and uh what's the biggest land mass I mean there's you said there's lots of little 
Islands how big are we talking um well one of the land masses is probably as big as Australia that's probably the biggest one and then everything from that falls smaller and smaller and 
smaller I asked when I first saw this planet you know why why is there more water on this 
world than they just said that's the way this planet evolved it was in a system where there 
was more water available to come down on the planet when it was being formed and it it's in a it's in a place where more water is coming from outer space in to it as well you don't realize it 
but this planet gets water from outer space every day okay and uh so this plant's in a really wet 
area and so they get a lot of ice and water come in to it that's why yeah yeah I heard about our 
own asteroids the whole asteroid that has a lot of water in it yes absolutely absolutely recent 
scientific discovery right water is much more common than people realize it's one of the 
basics of Life period yeah so there's not a whole lot of freshwater planets out there would you say 
um yeah it every planet that's habitable and habitable zone and it seems you know joined 
itself together to be a habitable planet would have tons and tons of water on it one way or the other our planet has tons and tons of water very few planets oceans what to say again in terms of 
oceans and seas they all have oceans and they all have seas and they all have fresh water on them every single planet I've ever seen has but the oceans are generally salt water would that 
be fair yes there's a yeah that's one of the the basics of life every kind of type of rock produces 
some kind of Basalt salt okay and the oceans are pretty much really heavily salinated life begins 
in even with us we're born in saltiness and that's one of the requirements of Life all right so this 
water world would again be in the Goldilocks zone you know when it's out is that how it usually is 
um uh the one that I was on with mitcha was actually fifth planet out it's a much bigger planet um it's bigger than Earth is twice the size of Earth it is not title locked it does 
revolve as a a semi season going around and um yeah it's it's it's different but the same you 
know the different parameters of things but it all falls into the same Goldilocks type of life going on I'm glad you brought that up because I think there's some misconceptions about the 
size of a planet and the gravity it has right really gravity is more based on you know your 
connection to the Sun and how distance is from the sun right how fast your planet revolves 
typical Force force and the weight of the planet will give you a heavier weight okay Earth is very 
dense and it moves pretty fast I mean we have one day okay cycle of turning that makes us pretty 
gravity heavy we're still close enough for the Sun for it to not be as heavy as we could be but yeah 
it's a very gravity handy because we're moving like gangbusters there are some planets that have two and three day cycles that revolve much slower and the gravity is lighter because of that and the 
larger the planet and the less it revolves well there's still there's numbers that go in it's like 
you know when you dial up the sound and you've got the woofers and the tweeters and all of that well gravity is kind of like that on a planet it depends on the size the mass which would be 
most of the size how fast it's revolving and how close it is to this planet whether it's tilted 
or not whether it's doing if it's title locked or whatever it's a lot of math is going into figuring 
out what this planet's gravity would be it's all different all of it how big its core is is yes 
so this water planet which was the fifth planet would be a little bit farther out than Earth but 
and uh it's a bigger planet yeah way bigger twice the size of Earth so this is kind of 
a medium-sized planet from what I've seen in my travels okay this is not a giant planet at 
all greater than Earth then yes it's about to figure twice the size of Earth the gravity the gravity oh it's actually less because it's day is longer it moves slower it revolves 
slower and it has a little bit less gravity this is the heaviest gravity Planet I've ever 
I was born here so I'm used to it but I've been other places now where the gravity is much lighter and Earth did have a lighter gravity before all you know what broke loose eons ago you 
know 280 million years ago 250 million years ago bad things happened and it It sped us up threw 
us into a different uh smaller weirder tighter orbit and it made us grab very gravity heavy 
those animals that lived on earth the the dinosaurs all of them were much bigger plants 
were bigger trees were bigger less gravity at that time now we're very gravity heavy we're almost a 
little bit closer to the Sun humanoids are bigger the Giants on Earth yes exactly and now we're 
not super well suited for Earth there's a lot of scientific research towards that like everyone's 
got low back pain not problems yeah yeah so this water Planet had lots of life on it the tons tons 
every kind of life you could possibly imagine the life life on this planet is replicated here they 
brought a lot of their floor and their fauna with them when they brought people here okay um and put them here um they have palm trees they have uh certain content you know papaya they have 
a boy um boy you know what boy is made out of and those plants um Ginger things like that all of 
those came from that world they brought them here for these people to to enjoy they didn't want them 
to be without what they were sustainably used to um every people that came to this planet were put 
in uh zones of of um ecology you know ecological areas where we were going to survive according to 
um how we were uh used to it what our DNA was scripting us to be comfortable in and that's 
how we all came out here that's why there's so many ethnicities of us we're all the same genome we're all human beings we're identical as a matter of fact but we have ethnicity issues we're darker 
lighter we some of us have bigger lungs just it's just different we dime out differently from 
different environments and they were providing us with sustainable environments to live in 
so on that water world do they have lions and tigers and bears no they have lots of monkeys 
and birds and ground dwelling things and I've seen rats and I've seen chickens and I've seen 
um uh big birds you know and uh prey birds and things like that and seagulls oh my God they got 
seagulls and big seagulls uh boobies you know flat-footed boobies were there and blue-footed 
boobies and albatrosses and all kinds of stuff they had everything I mean you name it they 
had it and it's unbelievably Lush with life all different kinds of Life different plants you know 
everything you name it they got it you visited there multiple times is that right yeah I've 
spent a lot of time there yeah everything became very very good friends with mitcha she and I are 
connected and I can remote to her and and we do have conversations from time to time she's 
my age she's older now too yeah so would time flow differently there I mean if you were to 
like spend three years here on Earth and go back to there would it be three years passing there 
um we don't they don't think of time like we do they don't pass time like we do they're living 
3D like we are they're in a a a gravity intense uh timeline but they gave up thinking about it 
that way in other words um your day begins when there's light and your day ends when there's dark and you rest when it's dark and so they don't Mark time the same way do we do 
um they have as a matter of fact when I met Mitch I thought I was older but I wasn't she told me 
that we were probably the same age I'm taller than mitcha and um she's uh shorter than I am 
I thought she was just younger I don't know if you can answer this but do they live longer there yes 
they do they have better health they're not polluting their bodies they're not eating the wrong things they're not stressing themselves out with negativity and uh they live very good 
lives they're in the yes they live a long time very long-lived so like 800 years or more yes oh 
yeah and we have gotten gypped that's terrible all right I know I feel really short-lived
all right goodness gracious okay um so what else can I ask about this planet you visited there from 
when you were a kid all the way up through adulthood yes the last time I was there um 
shortly before I became pregnant with my daughter and that's the last time I was there and when 
I became pregnant they Banned Me from too much travel and then once I was a mother here um I had 
to I was traveling here but I wasn't going through the universe like I wanted to yeah all right 
very cool very cool another thing we covered in the book which I thought would be fun to go over because it was so dramatic was they took you to a planet that was ending its life cycle 
and ultimately was destroyed and you got to visit this I think it was four or five times over a period of years yeah I was very young the first time I saw I was like 10 and they took me 
to a world um we didn't land on it uh we went very close we went into its atmosphere it was in a twin 
star system and the planet was devolving because the sun was because it was being eaten by its twin 
and uh it was swelling up and getting bigger and bigger and bigger like a red dwarf star okay and 
it was it was literally eating into its own solar system and this planet was uh losing its life it 
was going into that and so I saw the beginning of it they were had evacuated everybody off this 
planet because there was life living on it they actually had a population of people and uh they 
were thousands of years in the process of getting everything gone and uh we were going to visit it 
it was like a science experiment where noting the the evolution of this planet in this system by 
this star that was being eaten by another one and uh it was really cool first time I saw it 
there were still plants and and stuff on it but it looked bad and it was very dark their days it 
it became title locked as a result of what was happening to it and one side of the planet was already burning off and then the other half was just slowly dying in the cold and it was dark and 
cold and I saw mountain ranges and I saw trees and I saw all kinds of stuff but it was just 
it was gonna die you could tell it was all around when you say title lock that means one side is 
facing the sun right it quit we it quit revolving okay it was going down its magnetosphere was going 
it it pulls couldn't regenerate you know magnetism changes on a planet that's being annihilated by 
a red dwarf and it slows the planet down until it stops revolving and then it it's about to be 
eaten massively eaten all at one time and uh it comes apart it literally it it expands just like 
the sun is turning into a red dwarf the planet loses its cohesion and everything starts bubbling 
up and becomes molten and it burns and so I saw the beginning of that and went back several times 
marking is you know continued progress in this it takes a long time what we think should happen over 
19th a long time Universe moves at a different pace than we think and um so you were watching 
the forests burn up and the lakes Place yeah it's just being taken out you can see water going up on 
this is really cool um as I got older I know about this planet I was watching it 
um I would be given updates by talada you would show me mentally show me what was going on because they were constant contact with it and then in 2018 this is so weird to me my father 
passed away in 2018 January the second and I was very forlorn and they said you're going to 
have a joy this year and want you to know it I'm like okay he said do you remember seeing a supernova when you were younger I was in my 20s and and I said yeah and he said guess what 
you get to see it now they had taken me back in time to watch it Nova 60 million light years 
from here okay and I got to see it in real time Supernova here we saw the light of it 
finally get to Earth and I got to watch it again that blew my mind that helped me somehow it was
very poignant yeah yeah so this is something that we actually captured on the Hubble Telescope yes 
yes uh this this is amazing and I think it speaks towards how advanced these beings truly are to be able to take you there to see something live that actually occurred 
in the past wow yeah so you went there for the last final sort of thing got to see it way back 
in yeah we were close enough that it wouldn't harm us because when things go supernova gamma 
radiation is unbelievably bad we made sure that we were shielded enough and uh we got to witness 
it and we got the heck out of Dodge as fast as we could we we in other words we did a jump we 
did a light jump when we went to a door you know a dimensional doorway we came in watch it we got 
out and it was spectacular I mean it was just um you don't even know that light's about to pop off 
and it's brilliant you can feel a pressure from it there's a pressure wave with it and uh just before 
the pressure wave got on us we were gone but I could feel it coming I mean I could actually feel it coming made me sick to my stomach I was like oh my God you know this is incredible and then we 
didn't have anything open we saw the light right through the skin of the craft in other words the 
whole craft lit up and and so to this planet by that point was it just completely pulverized in 
in pieces yes it was already gone the sun ate it it totally um what's the word absorbed it 
desiccated it it is gone yeah it became part of its atmosphere that's what it did so it 
was looking for fuel so there's life throughout the universe as you mentioned follows a template 
so this is ultimately why we decided to call the book symmetry yes um can you speak a little bit 
about you know how there is symmetry to life throughout the Universe yes um universe that 
uh got several aspects to it the first one is is that it's got a hard uh drive like a 
computer in other words it's 3D it's very gravity heavy it's it's Mainframe it has planets it has 
Stars it has all kinds of chemical compositions in it it's just the main frame of life like your body 
is your Mainframe okay our universe is like that heavy duty Mainframe in 3D it exists in the third 
dimension totally within that Dimension within that Mainframe there are 12 total dimensions of 
of uh existence is the only way I can explain that each level of existence in this Mainframe is a 
different uh window into the next one in other words while you and I are sitting here talking 
I can tell you that there are other beings existing with us as uh interdimensional beings who live in exactly the same space with us and it's Planet wide it's 
Universe wide everywhere in the universe are 12 Dimensions one on top of the other 
the higher the dimensions you were able to go the more you can see they can see us we're not 
using our pineal glands we're not we're not using our ability to see them energetically okay our 
Consciousness knows they're there that we do see them from time to time without realizing it that's what we sometimes think specters are ghosts or whatever some people are when they pass away are 
still hanging out we can see them too but there are other dimensional beings with us they're just 
like us they evolved through this universe just like us and we're doing and it's very very cool 
all right that's cool at some point everyone reaches out into the third dimension and goes 
through the that and moves onward or upward or outward yeah oh well there's way more 
than that also I mean in our universe we have parallel universes with us there are more than one and we're all sort of together and there are multiple universes within this 
universe dimensionally speaking it's all the same universe okay arm Dimensions but there are those 
that are aligned with us I mean infinitely aligned in each one um I was taught that um 
we are energy we are thought we are light and we're conscious light and we're all together 
in what they consider to be a best word for it is Source we're all together in this energetic space and we come here to these bodies to experience and understand and learn and know 
how to use the knowledge that we all have innately as entities uh in Source we know everything there 
um it makes us mature it makes us Elevate consciously in other words we become smarter 
wiser wiser wiser and the more you're able to do with your Consciousness the more you learn and know and expand your conscious mind you can evolve and we will eventually be able to go up to 
some other level other than what we're perceiving now I think that we consciously push out not just 
to this universe but to others around us I think we can live simultaneously we're capable of it 
in many different and we move around through that so if we have like this kind of a tangent but we 
have I don't know seven eight billion people on this planet thereabouts yeah is that normal yeah 
yeah to have that many people on a planet um we're kind of a populated um nine million or billion uh 
nine billion is excessively I think it's between seven and eight and a half okay it fluctuates and 
yes it's too many we're living unsustainably we haven't learned the art of controlling our 
population of controlling uh how we exist with one another and that's a big deal and in that 
water world how many people would you estimate or do you know are living on that where mitcha is 
probably around three to four million people total and it's a much bigger planet so that's demand 
huh Lillian million all right they do not 
so generally speaking Garner their numbers when you live a long time you don't need to have 50 kids okay that's not the deal you're gonna live a long time you need to realize that if you keep 
having children you're going to use up all your resources you're going to use up all your time and you're not going to evolve in the way that you need to learn and do things and understand 
things Parenthood is a big deal it's a very very big deal and they regard Parenthood as one of the 
greatest challenges there are actually but they don't overuse it in other words they've learned to Garner that uh influence do they have pets like dogs and cats yep yep yep they has they very good 
at animal husbandry and they're very good at uh plants they're gardeners they're uh wise beyond 
belief in their caretaking of their environments you you have to because this is your this is your 
home world this is where you exist and even though you can go other places you still have to take care of where you live you have to use it as uh responsibly as you possibly can because it 
sustains you so there are humans and Grays and mantids and blue beans and short humanoids and 
whales and dolphins and all of it yes and giraffes and hipposis and all kinds of neat looking things 
you've never seen before yes all over teaming with life team mean yes okay so another thing 
that I found really interesting was uh you got the opportunity on a number of occasions to visit 
a huge motherships with animal husbandry centers and arboretums and what we hear on Earth call 
theoretically Dyson spheres which are artificial planetoids so these are real yes they exist 
um they are uh the one that I've been on I've been on I've been to one several times it's 
the same one um it's much bigger than Earth and it actually revolves it has a you know 
spin to it and they move it from systems with a star so then it can get within that 
stores uh gravitational field just enough to hang out there for a while till they move it 
again and it's quite the thing to move on they pretty much leave them where they put them it has to be a system that will allow it physically allow it into that system to stay 
um they're huge and they contain life that is a way station in other words uh if I'm going to 
go completely Across the Universe to a system out there on the other side I need some place to hold 
up and take a break and rest repair or whatever before I move on jumping interdimensionally is not 
as easy as it seems people like oh I'm just pooped and you know you're physically affected by it like 
anything electromagnetic anything where you're using energy physically affects you every time I 
fly with ET I become unbelievably exhausted and I have to take breaks and uh everybody else does too 
being in space is horrifically dangerous because you're in line with gamma radiation like you can 
even imagine and we have to we hop so that we're protected and this planetoid protects us it has 
its own magnetosphere because it's revolving they put it into a situation where it's able 
to do that okay and it creates its own core it has an energy core in it just like a planet that 
produces the magnetosphere they have graviton wave technology their technology is billions of years 
more advanced than ours and it's very very cool so it's an artificial situation that they mock 
As Natural a situation as they possibly can it's quite the feat and well that brings me to the 
next question because if I could design a world boy the things I would do so is this I mean like 
like a garden inside very yeah it's got everything it's got oceans it's got um uh mountains kind of 
sort of um it's got Lakes big lakes you know fresh water lakes it has um uh places where 
they can grow food on the outside of it they have that ability um they have uh big mechanical 
uh engineering places where when a craft flies in and it needs to have something done to it or that 
the indwelt pilot the co or the main pile and I'm a co-pilot the main pilot needs to get off and go 
do his own thing and he needs to rest because you can't you still expend energy there's you don't 
get something for nothing you're gonna use energy up when talato and I went he had to get off that 
craft he had to go be who he is and rest as well as I did and uh it's very it's so they have every 
situation you could possibly think of to handle whoever's on that craft for whatever reason so we 
have our crafts are being repaired we replenished with things that we need to travel and do whatever 
missions that we're on that kind of thing we have animals plants that are being moved throughout the 
universe that it's a weigh station for them it's a place for them to stay there until they decide where this is going to go and what they're going to utilize it for they have huge places where they 
do investigative interpreting of how how well this genome is working how well that genome 
is working plant-wise or animal wise and they do animal husbandry on these sometimes though 
like you know let's let's genetically Shore this one up you know we got some genetic drift 
going here let's you know fix it up a little bit Let's Help It regain its cohesive genetic 
uh ability to live and grow and Thrive wherever it's at and that kind of thing so it's pretty cool 
place just to clarify when we're talking about a Dyson Sphere our planetoid as they would call them 
I guess uh this is this hollow with like a gumball um well they live inside it is yeah they all these 
things that they've got going on are inside it as well as on the surface of it there's not a lot on 
the surface of it because the magnetosphere that they produce on this is not as large as a regular Planet okay so it's mostly inside and they have the lighting for it and that kind of thing they 
can generate incredible energy on the inside they can make enough uh UV uh radiation for things to 
grow and things on the inside so when you're in it it looks like you're on a planet you feel like 
you're outside you bet yep wow and when you're coming what does it look like from the outside 
um when I approach when we're coming into it um it's a actually has some uh reflective you know 
it reflects whatever's around it but it mostly it takes on the color of like a blue-green color you 
know on the outside it's shiny like that but then it's kind of matte where they're growing stuff on 
the outside of it and they actually have a body of water there's ice that kind of thing ice develops on them in certain places the poles they have poles like we do on our planet and stuff 
like that it's very cool so is this it's very brilliant to look at it is this metallic in its 
frame framing I guess with Earth and stone built around it so to speak um it's Incorporated the 
materials that they use are natural materials on the inside and then man-made or you know uh 
reconstructed things that they've brought in that'll co-exist in that particular type of 
space with that kind of gamma radiation coming at it you know and um so it's it's it changes they 
redo things all the time I mean it's not a set thing that's like this forever they're constantly 
reworking on this they're constantly rebuilding it they're constantly doing this sort of thing it's an evolving thing that you can't you can't not do it things wear out you have to replenish that kind 
of thing are these rare or do they have a lot of things yes they're rare there aren't that many of them that I know of I know the one that I've been on and I know of three others and they're placed 
strategically in the universe so yeah all right and can they hold and I can hold a lot of people 
yeah yeah you can get lost in there um I would put it as um at any given time there's probably oh 
I'm thinking about this really hard it's probably maybe close to about a million people on one at 
any given time simultaneously yeah all right well that's not constantly you're moving back 
and forth what is that that many compared to how many people we have here yeah yeah yeah well it's 
amazing they can they think about it there are trillions and trillions and zillions and 
I mean think about the universe how big it is I mean we just we're just one Galaxy okay 
um it takes our planet our solar system to go around our galaxy every 280 billion years okay 
and inside this universe I mean this galaxy that we have think about it there are two at least 200 
billion planets Suns whatever and and the amount of life that's in that intersecting all across 
our our galaxies is incredible and we're on the outside in other words we aren't even close to 
the center of it because it's you know it moves out um our particular arm of the our galaxy they 
used to think that we were right on the outside of it we're not we're inside that ring when we're in 
the Sweet Sea yeah have you been outside of the Milky Way yes yeah all right um now I'm 
curious I wasn't going to ask this but what about black holes have you ever visited a black hole 
a black hole is not what you think it is yes I know that's why I wanted to ask it because I think 
this is important internally suck up the universe and send it nowhere and there is no such thing as 
Wormhole they do not exist it's mathematically incorrect it cannot exist all physicists will 
tell you this is just a theory and it's actually a fail Theory because as much as they've studied it 
and tried to prove it what's real they've learned that it is not and they're just now starting to admit that um black holes do emit energy yes they crunch things up it's like a garbage disposal it 
takes matter in but then it shoots it back out it's what regenerates our galaxy and the universe 
as well every single galaxy has one and it's the cleanup crew and matter is totally transmuted and 
spit back out to make new things over and over again our universe is never going to grow cold 
because of that it we're constantly recycling our own energy it never goes away energy cannot not 
exist energy will existence is it close to one or get as close as safe um they have the ability you 
know I can remote view you if I wanna if I wasn't on here right now I could bring you up in my view 
and my I have the ability to psychically to pull you up and look at you okay I don't need to go 
within miles of that thing to see what it is okay they're not totally dark our Optics are crappy no 
offense I just wondered if they take their ships and go zoom zoom zoom picture of a black hole 
no we we get within distance of it that we can visualize it yes but uh it's got a huge there's a 
you don't even want to get within Striking Distance of it it'll suck you in you know if you're that small it'll take you real quick and there's many of them in each Galaxy right it's not 
just one at the same every single Galaxy in our universe has one sometimes they have two or three 
um andromeda's got a bunch okay I was gonna say I mean it's they're not super rare are they no 
they're not rare at all it's it's how our universe exists it's how it cleans itself up it retransmits 
energy into some other thing and it shoots the particles of form back out so that they can re-conglomerate together and make new things it's just it's the first part of what a Star Nursery 
becomes so right yeah another couple of things I wanted to touch on because we've been talking 
for not quite an hour yet but I really wanted to get to these because it's so cool okay which 
is you know we sent out the Voyager probe with a little golden record and all our information on it 
yeah we got two of them yeah yeah yeah Voyager one and two um so you had the opportunity to actually 
see these up close yeah from inside of a craft looking out at it is that right yep sure did it's 
very cool um uh they are uh not that big I mean they're bigger than me you know they're I don't 
know they're they're pretty damn big but not that big okay and they're fragile as I'll get out and 
ET is very proud of us for this that we built something that has taken a lot of 
hits okay that it's held up especially as systems it's amazing how well they've done okay and what 
they've been able to transmit back and I will tell you the truth about this E.T a couple times have 
intervened because uh we lost contact and recently and they've got it back again and they kind of 
help facilitate that a little bit they've they've helped it along they can't actually interfere with 
it but they've done some things that kind of help them keep going uh they find it fascinating what 
we put on the side of it you know uh Carl Sagan was a brilliant guy and uh he actually there was 
an encoded same message for a computer language as the disc you know where we are who we are what 
where our what planet we are our configuration and our soul system and everything and they did 
shoot a message back and uh we got it and not a lot of people know the truth of that you know I 
think it was out there I saw it once I mean I eyeballed it I saw it on in the news a couple times uh actually had to face what they look like you know we had like a little stick figure man and 
woman kind of thing and well man and they sent one back with their face pretty well generated 
and then they backed it up they did a uh what do they call those things where you go in the field you mush the grass down crop circles they did one they did a cloud Circle just like it oh wow yeah 
yeah we're seeing that one yeah so they were you know one-upping themselves trying to let us know 
that this is really happening in uh little people poop it and the government's trying to make you 
think we're all nuts for thinking this stuff and it's wrong it's real you know they answer so the 
ETS have taken you out for all these scientific expeditions to other planets and star systems and 
yes looking at eclipses and planets you know stars going Melvin yeah we had a huge event here in our 
solar system when Comet Schumacher Levy yeah um struck Jupiter and Boyle astronomers excited when 
this happened because nobody knew how this was going to affect Jupiter and it ended up having 
a much more profound effect than right no one had thought but you have the opportunity to actually 
get a first hand front row yeah you of this is that right right well I knew it wasn't going to 
go in a solid object okay and they were uh two of them or three of them I can't remember what 
they're two or three it was a big thing and it broke up into three first and then as as the gravity of Jupiter started tearing it apart it went into seven pieces and then they started 
striking and you know the planet's turning so they went boom boom boom boom boom boom like that and we got to see you know going in that kind of gas that hot it would just explode in 
an incredible hot heat fire I mean Nova fire just about just a second can you describe what it was 
like I mean where you were sitting on a craft right you were looking through the view what is that how close were you I mean can you just kind of walk us through that experience um well we were 
uh totally transparent so we had bird's eye view and everybody on the craft got to see it everybody 
was pretty much in the front facing part of it because they wanted to get as close to what they could see and they're practically above a little bit above because it's harder for us here on the 
ground here to see us when we're circling another planet we have to play with uh what we know about 
our Optics so now we see things in space from our telescopes and stuff like that so they had to position where we wouldn't see they wouldn't see us there was Humanity here wouldn't see them 
I have to get my vernacular straight because I'm talking from the other side of this fence
we had to be stealthy about it okay that's the best word I can use stealthy about it because we were damn close we were in orbit and we were damn close and we were watching and uh it was it 
was unbelievable the amount of information that they got from that alone was incredible it tells you all kinds of things about the composite of the gases on that gas giant and how thick their 
atmosphere is and everything I mean even NASA learned tons from watching that I mean they've 
learned a lot about Jupiter and its composition because of that and they were up to the same thing they wanted to know you know it's very cool yeah that must have been something to see these 
spectrometers were off the dials that's cool oh that's very cool well that's I think we've 
skimmed the surface of your actual experiences you know with flitting around the universe yeah 
I covered this in the book chapter is called Dolly Among the Stars because I mean man that is just 
uh just too lucky incredible Adventure it is it is I don't know I I I I I feel like I've lived 
25 lifetimes in my one life so far you know it's never stops I I want you all to realize something 
that everything that I've learned you're learnable to this you can learn this you can experience the 
same things that I have and that's why I came forward because I don't like being alone here with this I don't like being the only one who could talk about it I don't like the fact that 
um there are so many intelligent people on this planet and they're not giving it up to everybody else and not including and then being inclusive and encouraging and we're we're not using our 
innate abilities here and we need to we need to and he wants us to they want us to evolve up to 
this it's important yeah I want to talk about that in a future interview with you about you know the 
ETS message to all Humanity but I just recalled one other planet you went to which we didn't 
cover which was right after you learned I think he flew for the first time on your own he popped out 
at a giant purple blue gas giant is that right yeah that was pretty pretty unbelievably cool 
um it is have you ever wondered what a how long a neutron star or Quasar lives 
have you ever thought about that has anybody ever calculated how much energy this thing has and what 
happens at the end of its cycle because it will not go on forever like that it will burn out 
right and I was witnessing that actual occurrence in other words I was looking 
at the end of a neutron star's life and it was evaporating all its energy finally and there are 
examples of that throughout the Universe it's possible and we have one close to us enough 
that we can visualize it with the new telescope we have they can see it and I've seen this one 
so that's a big give ya everybody because that's I mean nobody ever talks about that and it bothers 
me every all energy exhausts itself eventually everything has a life cycle including neutron 
stars and clean quasars and what happens to them when they're done they don't just go they have 
a form a body of sorts and they glow different colors and you can see them particularly you know 
particularly drifting away from themselves you know they go off where do where do all 
those particles go where do all those elements go what's happening what's it feeding into you have 
to ask yourself these questions I mean it's really freaking cool and yeah I got to see one very cool 
all right well we've gone for an hour I'm sure we could talk for another hour easily but I did want to give you the opportunity to You Know cover anything that we didn't in terms of you know 
visiting other places other worlds uh because uh I mean I don't want to skip anything that would 
be really cool so do you have anything that you want to add to what we've already talked about 
um look up get a telescope start thinking about what's going on around you 
um get binoculars get get get a rake and a fork and a shovel and start cleaning up 
your environment learn to live sustainably um do everything you can to be a healthy happy 
interested individual you know learn to use your abilities you got all kinds of things you could be 
doing rather than sitting around talking about who did what yesterday would do you know I mean it's just way more fun interesting things to do than that way more you know yes well you've certainly 
lived an interesting life and still are so it's very very cool I'm really honored and delighted 
that you've shared your story with us it's really quite a pleasure and uh I want to thank you Dolly 
for coming on and sharing your story with all the people of the earth welcome my honor thank you for 
letting me I appreciate it you got it I want to do it again because there's more to talk about okay 
all right guys well that's our show for tonight I hope you've enjoyed it again this is part four 
interview with a fully conscious contact D Planet I have seen and uh yes it's amazing 
how much stuff is out there and we did Cover a lot of this in our book symmetry A true UFO Adventure 
so you can cover a lot more in a book than you can in an hour-long podcast so if you're interested in checking that out I'm sure you'll find it interesting and yeah Dolly I definitely want 
to have you back on again because there's some very cool stuff we still haven't talked about so there will be a part five and part six and possibly more coming ahead so 
till then thanks again dolly welcome thank you all right that's our show for today guys thanks 
so much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers keep 
looking for the truth and above all as I love to say because it's important keep having fun bye.
