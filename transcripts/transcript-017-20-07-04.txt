SCHOOLYARD ENCOUNTERS PART II: LANDINGS &amp; HUMANOIDS
Jul 4, 2020

Summary:
Jul 4, 2020
In Part One of this presentation,  dozens of cases of UFOs hovering over schools were presented. 
Now, in Part Two, we explore the more exciting cases involving landings and humanoids. There are 
five very famous incidents of UFOs landing next to schools:

1. Ariel Elementary School, Ruwa, Zimbabwe.
2. Broad Haven Primary School, Wales.
3. Crestview Elementary School, Opa-Locka, Florida.
4. Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Michigan.
5. Westall High School, Melbourne, Australia.

What many people don't know is that these five cases are just the tip of the iceberg. There are 
at least 40 documented accounts of UFOs landing next to schools. Often humanoids are seen. In 
some cases, messages are given. In a few cases, children are abducted. Government coverups, 
landing trace evidence, medical effects and more. The cases reach back more than 100 years and 
come from all over the world.  Something very profound is happening here!

This video presents the cases chronologically, as they happened.

Why are UFOs hovering over and landing next to schools? What kinds of messages have people 
received? What exactly is the purpose behind this agenda? This video will answer all these 
questions and more.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and  today I'd like to do part two of my presentation  
on schoolyard UFO encounters I did part one which  was about sightings I call part two schoolyard UFO  
encounters landings and humanoids these I think  are the much more exciting cases about thirty to  
forty percent of the hundred cases I documented  involved landings or humanoids often next to the  
school sometimes on the school playground itself  and a few cases of these ETS actually entering  
into schools there are a few abduction cases these  cases stretch back over a hundred years I'm going  
to just go through them chronologically and tell  you what what happens when a UFO actually lands  
next to a school so the earliest case I could find  occurred on July 24th 1909 this is probably part  
of the cluster of sightings the wave of sightings  which occurred at the end of the 19th century in   the beginning of the 20th century involving weird  Zeppelin like objects because that's what these  
kids described at Kelso school in New Zealand a  group of students and a teacher saw this object  
approach from the horizon it came very quickly  darted round it hovered the teacher said she was  
actually too frightened to observe it clearly came  quite low a bunch of kids did see it afterwards  
the adults separated them and had them each draw  pictures of what they had seen and they all drew  
the same exact shaped object or very close what's  interesting is several of the kids reported seeing  
a humanoid in some sort of a cockpit a small man  this was not an isolated sighting actually there  
were sightings prior to this and after it sort  of appeared to be part of a wave of sightings  
but definitely came very low over the school and  scared the Wits out of these kids and particularly  
the teacher so that's the earliest case the next  one I could find was about 15 years later in 1924  
I couldn't find a lot of information on this case  other than the main witness her name is Evelyn  
went and she was just a little kid at st. Joseph's  elementary school in Dade County Florida when  
a UFO landed on the playground she said it was  pretty small it was metallic it had a sort of a  
pitted surface to it and small robotic beings came  out they spoke briefly telepathically with her  
gave her some information about the school said  they would return again and went back into their  
craft which started to glow very brightly and then  took off and was gone that was apparently the last  
encounter she had really the cases began began in  1950s the earliest 1950 humanoid case I could find  
was October 15th 1954 this occurred in a little  town called Altis in Oklahoma and the main witness  
is a little kid who is on his way to school riding  his bike he had just arrived at the school and was  
in front of the school when we saw everyone was  looking up a police officer traffic had stopped  
everyone was looking up at this metallic saucer  shaped object it was about five hundred four  
hundred feet in the air quite large gray metal  and as he watched these portholes opened up and  
looking down out of this object were two humanoids  human looking beings the portholes closed and this  
object darted away very quickly a couple of miles  away then darted right back hovered again for just  
a few moments before being chased away by military  jets and the next day the newspaper said it was  
nothing about reflections in the clouds turns out  there's something special about the town of Altus  
Oklahoma this is the location of an Air Force  Base which houses nuclear material and in fact  
ten years later there was a very famous incident  of an object hovering right over the base where  
this nuclear material is being held so I think  that may have been part of the reason for this   encounter one year later July 17 1955 this is  another actually pretty famous encounter one of  
the main witnesses is Margaret Frey a few others  have been located but Margaret was in her vehicle  
with her doctor and another friend and they were  driving through Bexley England when this object  
started pacing their car it got lower and lower it  was very large and suddenly it goes right over the  
car and lands in the street in front of him this  is on the intersection of Ashburn and Whitfield  
in Bexley England and this object lands she gets  out of the car and well this objects just sitting  
there a bunch of kids saw it they surrounded the  object adults saw it as well soon there was 15 or  
so people surrounding the object which just stayed  there it was hovering just maybe a foot above the  
ground rotating and remained for about five ten  minutes when suddenly it lifted up slowly and  
then moved over a few blocks and hovered over  the local bed and well elementary school for a  
minute or two and then darted upwards and was  not seen again Margaret Frye ended up writing  
a book about this experience and other encounters  that she investigated one year actually one month  
later August 25th 1955 there was an encounter at  Evansville High School in Indiana several students  
were at the school this was that night and they  saw glowing short green humanoids playing on the  
football field this is a serious report it really  frightened them they called the police I would  
I find interesting about this particular cases  this took place four days and about 8090 miles  
away from four days before and 80 miles away from  another very famous case which we now know as the  
Hopkinsville Kentucky case in which the entire  sutton family saw this short green humanoid and  
actually shot at it and it turns out there was a  whole cluster of cases of green humanoids glowing  
green humanoids in this area at that time so yeah  they apparently visited Evansville High School  
Indiana one person who contacted me when he found  out I was doing research into school your yard  
encounters was Bruce core name and he told me a  very interesting encounter that happened to him  
in high school that this is at Kennard High School  in West Hartford Connecticut it was 1962 he was a  
band member and often practiced there on the field  and you can see him here in this photo he's on the  
left this is taken actually in 1962 at the time  of his encounter the encounter occurred at school  
he was practicing for band with other students and  was actually in the dressing room getting ready to  
change into his uniform when suddenly his friend  who was standing next to him socks him in the face  
hits him right across the face Bruce collapses to  the ground and jumps up and accuses his friend of  
you know hitting him in the face and asked him  why I did that his friend looks at him like he's   crazy and denies hitting him in the face at that  moment someone else in the room screams out oh  
my god how did it get to be so late it's already  a half an hour has passed and she had to get out  
of there so that was all Bruce really recalled  for a while he started having other encounters  
and later on some years later we had a completely  different memory of what happened on that day his  
friend did not hit him what he remembered instead  spontaneously was that a gray came rushing into  
the room and came around him and struck him with  this sort of weird wand like instrument on his  
head Bruce remembers then you know blacking out  and he woke up he was lying on the ground he was  
surrounded by Gray's who were moving around and  kind of placing him there it appeared that none of  
the other students around him were moving it was  like time had stopped and suddenly the Grays are  
gone times rooms back up and starts moving again  in a normal pace and he stands up and accuses his  
friend of hitting him the whole memory of the  experience left him for years so yeah I think  
there are probably cases of people being abducted  out of schools fact that's not the only case like  
that I know of another case where witness saw  Gray's moving through a classroom time stopped the  
greys came in the walked up and down the aisles in  the classroom next thing he knows the Grays walk  
out and class starts up normally and no one acted  like anything strange had happened another weird  
case occurred in 1964 when I did contact in the  desert in 2019 I was approached by this witness  
and I interviewed her she wrote this very detailed  story about what happened to her and it's a very  
interesting case it was 1964 she was 12 years  old at a Catholic High School in Mentor Ohio her  
friend she was on the playground when her friends  suddenly said look look what's that and she turned  
in time to see this classic metallic gray saucer  descending down from the sky it got lower and  
lower and lower until it appeared to actually land  next to the school in a grove of trees this is  
something again we see quite a bit these objects  landing next to the school in a grove of trees  
sort of disappeared from view she couldn't tell if  it had landed or not but it was definitely below  
treetop level and at this point she said a weird  thing happened time seemed to stop or it was just  
her in the UFO there was a sense of timelessness  this is another thing we see in these cases and   she said she got a message and the message was  remember this day was in clear English it came  
twice she doesn't think it was her own thoughts  it was very clear to her at any rate about that  
time this object suddenly lifts up and darts away  fast as a bullet she saw a Silver Streak she says  
if you weren't looking at it you probably would  have missed it and after that nobody talked about  
it now which was very strange she doesn't remember  or know if anyone else in the playground besides  
her four friends saw it but it was an experience  she remembers to this day certainly and was not  
her only encounter she would later have more  encounters a very interesting case occurred  
in December 1965 this is at Deer Creek Middle  School in Shasta Lake California 45 students and  
a couple of teachers saw this metallic object  it was described as a 40 foot diameter silver  
disc your classic flying saucer it approached the  school and came over the front of the school went  
over the school and seemed to land behind the  school and the in the grove of trees there so  
they called the police the police came apparently  there were some government agents who showed up   as well at any rate one of the witnesses says that  she went to that area after class had been let out  
many other kids were going back and forth to visit  the spot and sure enough there was a 40-foot ring  
diameter of crushed or burned grass which actually  remained there for a number of years she showed it  
to her mother no plans for the grow there so  yeah it's another great case of a UFO landing  
next to a school another case occurred in March  1966 1966 was a huge year for all of these kinds  
of cases this one comes from John keel a prominent  investigator who was embroiled in an investigation  
in West Virginia at Point Pleasant West Virginia  in particular involving a lot of UFOs and of  
course what we now know as the Mothman and one  case investigated took place at Point Pleasant  
school a lady had shown up to pick up her kids  and was shocked to see a flying saucer hovering  
above the playground and not only that there was  a door open and a humanoid it was floating outside  
the saucer was close enough where she could see  it had weird eyes in a strange uniform on it and  
she said this thing didn't even notice her and  said it was looking down at the kids and I quote  
very intently so yeah it seemed very interested  in the kids on the playground which is a little  
concerning to say the least one case in which I  was able to best interview one of the witnesses  
personally occurred also in March 1966 at Point  Elementary School this is in Missouri the main  
witness is melody corn she and her five friends  were at Point Pleasant or I mean I'm sorry point  
two elementary school it was recess and most  of the kids were playing Foursquare and they  
decided they wanted to do something different so  they went out to the far side of the field of the  
football field there it's a very rural area and  they were gonna play tag no sooner had they got  
there when melody looks down and she sees all  these weird footprints little tiny footprints  
that were you know half human sized maybe they  were bipedal they could see that much and they  
were trying to figure out who could have made  these weird footprints when someone noticed a   very bright light in the trees next to the school  their first thought was ice cream truck you know  
they're young little kids I was a white light so  they decided to go past the school boundary which  
they're not supposed to do and go and investigate  and they went thinking it's an ice cream truck but  
instead it came upon a disc it was landed it was  fairly large like a small room maybe silver it had  
a light on top they don't remember if there was  landing legs or not because their attention was  
actually drawn towards a humanoid a being that  was much closer about a hundred feet away maybe  
fifty and it was very short had dark skin I was  wearing a uniform of some kind very large eyes a  
large bald head it wasn't a grade though but skin  was very dark and kind of lumpy and a face almost  
like a gorilla she said and it was very strong  it looked a muscular like a gymnast and it was  
staring melody and her friends in the eye all  the kids lined up in a row and kind of stared  
right back this thing never broke its line of  sight started to back upwards towards its craft  
as it did so it there was a farm where just object  had landed and there was four cows it reached out  
and touched one of the cows that cow dropped down  on its side apparently unconscious at that moment  
miss Ohlendorf one of the teachers at the school  approached from behind them and began screaming  
how she was utterly hysterical she grabbed the  kids and pulled them back into the school and  
ushered everyone on the playground back into the  school at this point all the kids could now see  
this object in the trees glowing and flashing  lights they ran into the school and ran into  
their schoolroom classroom and up to the windows  Miss Ohlendorf rushes in and she's trying to close  
the blinds as all the kids are rushing up to the  windows to peer at this object she closes all the  
blinds and then goes and gets another teacher the  principal and they immediately cut the school day  
short send everyone often to the gymnasium one  of the kids is looking out one of the gymnasium  
windows which is very high up and he seizes  objects dart by he screams and tells everyone  
there it goes at that point the school buses  show up and everyone is sent home from school  
early following this incident it was the buzz of  the school but the teachers absolutely refused to  
discuss anything about it to this day there's at  least four of those witnesses are still alive the  
first case to really generate any real interest  publicity wise and certainly governmental wise was  
one that occurred on March 21st 1966 this was a  case that actually shook high levels of government  
at some point this occurred at Hillsdale College  among the witnesses were Barbara Cohn and Cynthia  
Pavan Berger who looked out their dorm window  one night and saw this huge glowing saucer-shaped  
craft they said it was beautiful had lights on  it it came very close to the dorm window a huge  
crowd of students gathered soon there was 60 70  80 students almost 90 teachers saw this school  
administrators saw this this object hovered around  went over around the airport Tower came very close  
to the school it actually landed at one point in  this marshy area in front of the school a bunch of  
the boys students were gonna go out and chase it  but it lifted up again the police were of course  
called they viewed this object one of the police  officers took out his gun and was going to shoot  
at it but the other officer prevented him this  object remained for at least two hours before  
finally moving away I was not an isolated sighting  there had been a sighting earlier that day which  
was very well described very credible and that  over a period of months there were a number of  
sightings in fact some photographs were taken  here's one of the photographs right here this  
is obviously not taken at Hillsdale College which  occurred at night but this could very well be the  
same object at any rate this sighting did cause  a lot of waves of publicity and the Air Force was  
asked to investigate to look into it now they sent  J Allen Hynek from Project Blue Book who showed  
up and really had just began an investigation was  four days into it when he held a press conference  
and it was just a media circus he said he felt  like the press was looking for little green men  
and he was looking for a logical explanation  and raised the possibility that this was Marsh  
gas this was just one explanation he offered  but the press seized on it and said the Air  
Force thinks it's Marsh gas that wasn't exactly  what Hayek said at any rate he called this the  
low point of his career with Project Blue Book  he left shortly later following this incident  
representative Gerald Ford called for a national  investigation which there was one the scientists  
involved in that investigation that hearing said  that UFOs were probably real and deserved further  
investigation nevertheless at this point the Air  Force was just trying to extricate itself from   having to deal with the public and they formed  the content committee shortly later which ended  
up giving a negative impression about UFOs  told officials that they should not teach  
this subject in schools which I found interesting  and ultimately this led to the closure of Project  
Blue Book Hynek however since then became a huge  believer in UFOs and it was this case which Jim  
and coral Lorenzen cited and they said that they  had uncovered a number of cases of UFOs hovering  
over schools around this time so they were warning  that UFOs are very interested in schools Raymond  
Fowler had also noticed this same pattern and  said that out of some 1520 cases I believe it  
was 7 he said were over schools so yeah they were  probably a little bit prescient there because it  
was literally two weeks later that the granddaddy  of all schools yard UFO encounters occurred one  
of the biggest ones of all certainly it  is Australia's most widely viewed and most  
famous sighting it occurred on April 6 1966 at  Westall high school in Melbourne Australia some  
200 probably more accurately 300 students and  teachers saw multiple objects it all began when  
students were on the playground playing sports saw  one two or three objects show up when among these  
was Terry Peck she and everyone screamed that  this is flying saucers and they watched one of  
these objects actually land in the grove of trees  next to the school this is a grove of trees that  
called the grange where high school students some  times hung out to you know become intimate or you  
know smoke a cigarette or something like that and  so this object actually lands in the trees Terry  
Peck is with a group of students who actually run  out there and what see this thing land she said it  
was like a small sports car gray heat was coming  off of it it crushed the grass underneath it was  
down on the ground for only a few seconds a couple  of students were so shocked they actually fainted   the paramedics showed up ambulances and police the  press were shortly behind them but at this point  
the object had landed for just a second and it  took off immediately first it turned on its side  
and then darted away of the other objects circled  around for just a short time five planes showed up  
Cessna planes and we're circling these objects  and a bunch of students were in the school when  
all this was going on a bunch of Lauren mr. green  woods class when someone came running in and said  
there's UFOs hovering outside Marilyn Smith she  was a student in the class she saw these objects  
she didn't run to see that object landed she just  sat on the fence crying with her friend thinking  
was the end of the world Kevin Hurley saw these  objects suzanne savage she was another witness  
who didn't go out there but just sort of hung back  Jacqueline argent saw it Kathy Salas says it was  
definitely not a plane Lance Brown he was in mr.  green woods class he also saw it max in verloc  
saw this object and also saw the landing traces it  made so this caused a complete panic in the school  
the entire incident lasted some 20 minutes perhaps  it's unclear exactly how long it lasted but by the  
time it was gone the police were there the press  had shown up and kids were trickling back into  
the school the press was giving interviews  and the military shows up there are soldiers  
in uniform they immediately chased away the media  all the kids were brought into the school some of  
the kids who had seen this object land were taken  into separate offices and not only questioned by  
the military but basically threatened and told not  to talk there was a teacher there who was taking  
pictures during this whole incident the military  allegedly took her film graham simons simmons he  
was a teacher there he was told specifically to  tell children not to talk about this incident the  
note Terry basically shut the school down for that  day all the kids were brought into the auditorium  
for an emergency meeting by the headmaster Frank's  amble be who said that if you think you saw a UFO  
you're mistaken there's no such thing as UFOs it  was an experimental craft of some sort and you  
are not to talk about it and basically that was  a cover-up that led to nobody talking about the  
incident those who did were given detention there  were a couple of newspaper articles but but were  
generally skeptical and the entire incident was  pretty much forgotten for years one year after  
the incident researcher James McDonald did show up  an interview mr. Greenwood and some of the other  
teachers and students so there was research into  this incident there was an airport very nearby  
they called the airport and asked about these five  planes the airport denied any knowledge of the  
incident or of the five planes which seems very  peculiar so yeah this kind of this event faded  
into history for quite some time until researcher  Shane Ryan sort of revived it made a documentary  
he's since interviewed some hundreds of witnesses  who's not only seen this object but saw the  
landing traces which apparently were plowed over  by the way shortly after they were made and he's  
continuing his research he's talked to people who  were involved involved in the official response  
and to this day Witnesses are still talking about  it there's actually a memorial on the site where  
this landing occurred so yeah Australia's most  famous sighting by far but this kind of landing  
on something it's not unique another case occurred  a few months later this wasn't widely viewed this  
was actually viewed by one person October 1966  this case from John keel again he interviewed a  
man by the name of Larry Elmore Larry Elmore had  insomnia and would often take walks late at night  
and he was taking a walk near his home this is in  Duncan Falls Ohio and he's walking by the Duncan  
Falls elementary school when he notices this weird  little shed that hadn't been there the you know  
before and it was very strange-looking it had no  windows it was just great metal it was strangely  
shaped and didn't look like a shed at all and  it gave him a very creepy feeling and he walked  
by it and thought this was very strange and went  home and actually decided he was going to go take  
a second look and went to go see it and it was  no longer there so that shook him up very badly  
because it was clearly not a shed and this was the  case that really raised John keels suspicions and  
he noted this case as being one of many that were  next to the school yards there's a weird timing  
aspect to a lot of these cases and precisely  one year after the West Hall High School UFO  
incident to the day there was a really remarkable  case in the United States in opa-locka Florida to  
be precise at Crestview elementary school was  April 6 1967 and a group of six students and  
the teacher Robert Apfel were on the playground  although other students had gone inside when one  
of the students pointed in the sky and said mr. FL  what's that it was a metallic disc mr. Apfel later  
said I said it looked like two metallic lenses  kind of placed rim to rim it was just visible  
for a few moments then it went back inside or you  know it disappeared and they went back inside the  
next day was the real show suddenly these objects  showed up over the school there was three of them  
and one landed in the trees behind the school  repeatedly all the students saw this they ran  
out of the playground some 200 students there was  complete panic and a number of teachers saw this  
as well these kids were aged 9 to 13 Jimmy Hummel  was one of the witnesses he said this outfit was  
hiding and darting and hovering some of the kids  are crying and screaming Joe kornblatt saw Linda  
and John McCleary brother and sister they saw it  Jill Myers David Bonnefoy he got a good look at it  
some of the teachers who saw this other than  Robert Apfel were virginia Martin and Marion  
waters they drew pictures of this as did some of  the students and as these objects were hovering  
there the military shows up and actually pulls  everyone into the school and tells them not to  
talk about it says that their helicopters that's  all and shuts the school down kids are sent home  
those who can walk to school or who ride their  back to school were allowed to leave and they  
said the objects were still there when they left  they tried to approach but they were stopped by  
a military barricade and one kid said these guys  had shotguns the other students left by school bus  
and they said the objects were gone by that point  some students tried to approach the next day to   go to the landing traces and it was still roped  off some later did see the landing traces though  
those two were allegedly destroyed at some point  the next day was Saturday and the UFOs showed up  
again there was a man John Wolfe who lived next to  the school and he and his son's watch this object  
they alerted the neighbors who littered their  neighbors and soon there was a group of about   40 people watching these objects again hovering  in the same grove of trees right next to the  
school so that created another press furor but  again like the Westville case this case seemed  
to slide into history and was forgotten after Oh  the aerial phenomena research organization did  
do some research into this case but after that  there was little or no attention paid to it as  
most of these cases seemed to be they just kind  of slide through history some very weird cases a  
very strange case occurred in May 1967 two young  students who prefers to remain anonymous this was  
at Peebles elementary school in Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania this this student was with her  
friend on the playground when the janitor mr. Swan  motioned them over to come closer and he wanted  
to show them something and he took them into the  furnace room and said that this craft had landed  
on the baseball field and that he was able to it  was small and light enough that he was able to  
carry drag it apparent light into this furnace  room I was very small just like a very small  
Volkswagen Beetle other witness said and reminded  her of a Jetsons car you know the Jetsons the  
animated TV series she was looking at this thing  and had a clear transparent dome on top there was  
a control panel and weird colored lights and she  had the impression that this craft was powered by  
a sort of propulsion device her friend fainted  at this point what she thought was really funny  
but most of her attention was drawn towards this  being that's very short four-foot tall gray what  
she now recognizes as a gray she wasn't scared  she said he looked very friendly very childlike  
I had four fingers and he actually had a message  for her his the message to the witness was we are  
here to remind you who you are she has no idea  what this means doesn't know what it means to  
this day it doesn't quite remember what happened  after this just remembers walking home that day  
she did tell her mother her mother believed her  but was concerned and to this day she doesn't know  
what to make of this incident it's a very strange  case so there are a lot of cases I mean we're in  
the 1960 60s right now October 18th 1967 Patrick  Henry junior high school in Sunnyvale California  
all the students were out on the playground  all the male students had just gone inside the  
locker room the female students were just going  back in when when somebody shouted out look and  
there were these six sort of egg-shaped objects  floating in the sky about 40 students 50 students  
actually saw this thing as well as a couple of  teachers the teachers became very concerned and  
ushered the girls inside very quickly one of the  witnesses stay out as long as she could and saw  
these objects moving away and one of them appeared  the land in the orchard behind the school so after  
school she made a point to go investigate and  went out into this orchard and that's all she  
remembers she believes she had missing time she's  pretty concerned about it she remembers getting  
home late and that's all she knows she doesn't  know what to make of it but she does wonder about  
the fact that there was a military base near her  home Moffett Field that's called in Sunnyvale and  
she thinks that that might be related but she  doesn't know yeah there are cases where these  
ut's actually approached school students right at  the school another early case 1967 Westmoreland  
High School in New York Shayne kurz was with  her mother sometime earlier and had seen a UFO  
outside their home in upstate New York this case  by the way was investigated by Hans Holzer who's  
a paranormal investigator but did investigate UFOs  as well Shanker's said this object that they saw  
scared them pretty badly so they decided to go  inside and it was some time later not long where  
she's walking to school one morning and it's just  about to go inside the school she's right near the  
doors when she's approached by a gentleman very  strange-looking guy he's got you know he's got  
very pale skin weird hypnotic gray eyes his ears  are pointed he's wearing strange clothes and he  
starts asking her questions in a weird foreign  accent in English and though she's like I have  
to go to school and you know play volleyball  and he's like well what's volleyball she's like  
you know basketball volleyball he's like what's  basketball so he was asking weird questions and  
then tried to persuade her to go into his quote  white vehicle that was in the field next to the  
school there were no roads there he pointed to  this field and she thought he was a very creepy  
guy and said no and turned around to walk him  to the school and realized how strange he really  
was and whirled around and he was gone this was  impossible there should have been no place he  
could have run to she was immediately approached  by some friends who asked her who was that weird  
man so she knows she wasn't crazy she wasn't  the only one to see him she says I don't know  
and didn't think much of it until a short few days  later when she was at a convenience store near her  
home and there's this guy she's looking through  magazines and she sees this same figure the same  
pale figure with the weird hypnotic gray eyes and  pale skin staring at her in a very creepy fashion  
so she leaves the convenience store but it was  just a few days later she was abducted out of her  
home into a UFO and on board the UFO she saw this  same figure so yeah he was apparently stalking her  
this whole time another case occurred just a few  years later January 1519 69 these cases occur all  
over the world this case occurred in Via franca  de los perros Jesuit college in Badajoz Spain  
this is a religious college and a UFO was seen  a glowing saucer-shaped object was seen landing  
in the rural sort of fields outside the school by  students as well as a couple of teachers and that  
evening some of the students multiple students  said that they saw this very tall being peering  
in through the windows of the school building  it was described as being very tall and had a  
greenish hue to its skin and a very broad face  not human the students were very concerned but  
the priests who ran the school refused to discuss  it refused to let the students talk about it and  
actually forbid them from talking about it and  it was only years later when one of the students  
told his parents that this case was uncovered  another case involving a landing occurred on  
April 30th 1970 this is at Nathaniel Hawthorne  College in Antrim New Hampshire a bunch of the  
girls the ladies in the women's dorm reported a  UFO had landed outside the school the police were  
called Prescott when did the incident there was  an article written but the girls did receive some  
teasing from some of the boys at the dorm until  a few days later at night some of the guys were  
outside the school when a UFO rose up from behind  the trees it was very dark they couldn't make out  
a shape at first but it turned out to be a large  triangular shaped object and it rose up and went  
right over their heads blotting out the sky the  Stars and they needless to say they no believes  
the girls when they said this thing had actually  landed another case was found or I mean occurred  
on August 21st 1970 this is a very bizarre  and interesting case which occurred actually  
in Bukit Malaysia at stole elementary school well  the teachers and students noticed that one of the  
students was missing they conducted a search and  found him outside of the school grounds in the  
forest there he was unconscious they dragged him  back into the school he woke up and he said that  
a UFO had landed next to him it was very small  like the size of a football little tiny beings  
came out he tried to approach and capture one  of them and it shot him with a beam of light on  
the arm and knocked him out he pointed to his arm  where there was a small burn teachers did not know  
what to make of this incident he drew the being  said he saw the craft but in the weeks and months  
following this a bunch of these students reported  the same thing these tiny craft landing next to  
the school and little beings coming out it was  a wave of sightings which occurred over a period   of months and then finally stopped occurring  another abduction case occurred in the late 1970s  
to Jean Marie Robinson she wrote a book about her  experiences called alienated took her a while to  
realize she was having UFO experiences she didn't  realize this when she was a high school student at  
a high school in the ozarks area of Missouri one  evening she and all the girls had heist at her  
local high school decided to have a slumber party  this was a yearly event they did she was pretty  
excited about it fifty girls showed up and spent  the night at the school gymnasium just talking and  
swapping ghost stories and things like this and in  fact Jean and a group of about 20 other students  
decided that they were going to hold a little  seance and they went into one of the side rooms  
there with one of the teachers and conducted this  little seance to their shock this misty ghost-like  
form entered into the room through the wall and  approached them and it caused complete panic gene  
remembers becoming very disoriented fainting and  this being this apparition disappeared for years  
she thought this was a ghost you know I need to  say this cut the SANS short but she thought this  
was a ghost for years but was having a lot of  UFO experiences following this and eventually   sought out Budd Hopkins and underwent hypnosis  and under hypnosis a very different scenario  
emerged she recalled that during the seance  instead of this misty farm coming in it was a  
gray not only one gray actually five of them five  Gray's came through the wall approached five of  
the girls including Jean and floated them out of  the gymnasium through the wall and into a UFO that  
was landed next to the high school inside the  UFO they underwent an examination and some sort  
of gynecological procedure was not pleasant they  were immediately returned back to the gymnasium  
each girl was put back in her proper position and  the Grays left and then time suddenly started up  
again and they thought it was a ghost everyone  screamed and panicked and ran into the main room  
was yeah years later that she realized that this  was probably an abduction so that's how it goes  
in some of these cases there are weird aspects of  these cases here's one that occurred in May 1972  
to a boy by the name of Carl Wilson he was just a  kid at the time he his brother and his father were  
in Fort Worth Texas making deliveries his father  did deliveries and often brought his sons along  
and Carla joined him that day it was a Saturday  when this UFO showed up and he noticed it was  
hovering right over the high school was very  strange because his brother and father didn't  
seem to pay much attention to it at all he did see  some people staring at it he did see cars stopping  
and looking at it he tried to get other witnesses  but wasn't able to and they moved on to their next  
delivery he saw this object again it was hovering  over the junior high school he later saw hovering  
over the elementary school he's he said and I  quote here the objects I saw were hovering over  
all the schools in town which was weird because  it was a Saturday and there was nobody in the  
schools but yeah he tried to get more witnesses  his brother wouldn't look his father forbid  
him from looking his father seemed very nervous  about the whole thing at one point there was some  
confusion about time there was at least four or  five sightings they had of this object appearing  
and reappearing and so on and definitely strange  levels to this case because it was years later  
that Carl started having major UFO experiences and  realized he was an abductee but it's weird that it  
hovered over all the schools I think in some cases  these objects are putting on displays and want to  
be seen I mean consider what happened at Rosemead  High School this is in Middleburg South Africa on  
November 12th 1970 school 1972 the principal of  the school was in his home his school is right  
neck his home is right next to the school and he  noticed these weird lights hovering in the tennis  
courts next to the school red lights swirling  around and he vowed to go out there and take a  
look and turns out he was not the only witness  who saw this there was police officers who were  
looking at this from a distance using binoculars  there were also some guards at an oil field who  
saw these red lights descend over the high school  and apparently land and at some point took off the  
next morning the principal went to the tennis  courts and got a real shock these tennis courts  
are surrounded by a tall fence they're locked  they were still locked but the tennis courts  
were destroyed they were tore up all the top not  all of it but much of it was torn up none of it  
was overturned just it was weird because pieces  of the star were just missing they later found  
a bunch of it outside of the fence on the fence  son as far as a couple of hundred yards away there  
were no tire tracks no indication that the fence  had been disturbed it did notice that the blue gum  
tree next to the school the leaves on it were  burned and withered a bunch of people examined  
the damage done to these tennis courts no one was  able to figure out what happened scientists looked  
looked at it it wasn't an explosion of any kind  that they could figure it wasn't a whirlpool or  
tornado wasn't lightning they don't know what it  was I think this was a purposeful display where  
these UFO occupants tore up the tennis courts  to let people know again that you know something  
that they don't know about is out there very  bizarre case occurred two years later March 20th  
1974 - Becky Ingram of Louisville High School in  Tennessee in Louisville Tennessee she was walking  
across the football field one day this is midday  and suddenly found herself on board a UFO she  
was surrounded by short humanoids who grabbed  her took her and examined her she said it was  
not pleasant it was a very brief experience next  thing she knows she's back on the football field   she now speculates that this object was actually  landed there but was invisible she did suffer  
some after-effects from this encounter including  including excessive urination excessive thirst  
headaches saw she was disoriented for some time  oh she had nausea these symptoms eventually faded  
but she was later visited by men and black who  threatened her about the incident Oh another very  
bizarre case comes from well-respected researcher  Leonard Stringfield who had gotten a call from a  
student a young man a student who said that he  was afraid he was going to be kidnapped by a UFO  
Stringfield wasn't home at the time so he wasn't  able to talk with the student but he returned  
home later and got the message and was going to  call the students but instead the students father  
called the father was frantic and said that his  son was missing and could Leonard help he knew  
that his son had called Leonard Stringfield  because he had called the police as well and  
you know found out that his son had called Leonard  Stringfield the son had actually told him because  
it turns out the day before this boy had come home  from school for a fundraiser and said that a UFO  
had followed him home and he was afraid it was  going to kidnap him his parents didn't believe  
him and the next morning they woke up and found  a note on the kitchen table written by their son  
and it explained that he was still afraid this UFO  was coming for him he had withdrawn $500 from the  
bank and was fleeing because he was did not want  to be kidnapped by this UFO a long story short  
they found the boy at Atlanta Airport they took  him home he was still very frightened they called  
up Leonard Stringfield and got the whole story  from him it turned out that one year earlier the  
boy was on the playground at his high school when  a UFO showed up it was pretty low metallic and he  
felt it had singled him out was looking at him  and that night he was visited by weird humanoids  
in his bedroom who told him telepathically  don't be afraid but you need to come with us  
so ya this poor boy I was afraid he was going  to be encountered you know abducted by ETS and  
I honestly don't blame him lots of cases all over  the world June 19 1975 Atlit oka Methodist school  
mission school in Fiji there was a very strange  encounter were a bunch of school elementary school  
students so that they were approached by eight  hairy Dwarfs they were about two feet tall and  
the students chased after them in these short  little hairy Dwarfs are immediately ran off into  
the brush that surrounds the school so there's  a legend on Fiji of Little People this could  
have been them or could have been ETS they did  not see any actual UFO but this is another case  
of you know et you know weird humanoids on the  playground at the very least another case which  
was certainly disturbing occurred over a period  of years in the mid-1970s this occurred at Falls  
Elementary School in Green Valley California the  main witness said that she attended this school  
from kindergarten through sixth grade and during  this whole time the whole time she was there she'd  
be out on the playground and would be approached  by a weird student who always looked a little  
strange who looked like a normal student at first  but she started to see through this sort of screen   memory and saw that it was actually a gray I mean  it was bald and weird eyes you know the whole deal  
but normal normally she would just think it was  a student a weird student and he would ask her  
all these weird questions and try to get her to  go into the grove behind the school sometimes he  
also taught her stuff weird mathematics and  things that kind of went over her head she   doesn't remember lot of it she's trying to piece  back her memory this all came back to her years  
later as an adult after the school had been torn  down but she does have memories of other children  
being taken she remembers at one point authorities  had to be called because one of the children had  
been traumatized or hurt and the school forbade  anyone from going into the grove behind the  
school following this one particular incident so  it's not you know I know of another case which  
I wasn't able to investigate it's not in the book  or apparently an entire class wasn't invested was  
abducted so I don't know I think there could be  a lot more abductions in some of these landings  
that were not aware of there are cases where  these objects actually follows school buses as  
well one case occurred in December 1976 outside  of Whitehorse this is in the Yukon area of Canada  
and the main witnesses school bus driver and her  daughter the school bus driver became concerned  
because this object started to appear in pace her  school bus happened not once or twice but multiple  
times over a period of over a month many of the  students saw this object as well it always kind of  
paced the bus from a distance but still made her  nervous enough that she told the school that she  
would like to change her route and get a different  route the school granted her little change and  
didn't work she was driving her new route and this  object still showed up one time she's driving home  
with her daughter they're the only ones in the  school bus when this object approaches again  
this time it comes much closer and they stop  and this time it approaches right in front of  
the school bus and they there's a big porthole and  they can see humanoids figures silhouettes looking  
at them through this window and scared them very  badly but that turned out to be the climax of  
the event and following this they stopped being  followed by this UFO but it's certainly not the  
only school bus incident or even one that occurred  at a school bus stop where the children got very  
freaked out one very famous and well-known case  occurred in at Broad Haven elementary school  
primary school in Wales this occurred on February  4th 1977 I don't want to go into too much detail  
on this case because it's already been pretty  well investigated by researchers like Randall  
Jones Pugh or Neil spring both of who have done  research on this incident but at any rate it's an  
incredible case more than a dozen students we're  out in the playground in front of the school when  
an object showed up it quickly landed right in the  trees next to the school it was described as about  
40 feet long blueish maybe silver ish it had a red  light on top a door opened and a et emerged was  
described as short wearing a silver blue suit  many of the kids became very frightened David  
Davies saw it he said it was pearlescent it had a  dome on top he was one of the last students to run  
up and see this thing Michael Matheson saw it he  said it had a silver dome and a light on top just  
like the other witnesses David George saw it is  that it was hominid humming he saw a humanoid in  
a silver suit they said had little ears weird kind  of ears to it Philip James Rees saw it as soon as  
it landed he ran to get help from the teachers the  teachers refused to listen to him did not believe  
him David Ward's saw this object saw the humanoid  come out I said it was short it had weird ears it  
was carrying perhaps a weird camera maybe had a  you know he described a uniform that was blueish  
or silver Jeremy passed some or saw Tudor Jones  Colin Davis he also described the blue uniform all  
these children saw it afterwards the teachers  didn't believe them at first until a set they  
separated them had them all draw pictures it was  clear the kids were sincere some were crying they  
stuck to their story they've always stuck to their  story they were still sticking to her story they  
signed a petition following this event turned it  into police turned out at this time there was a  
huge wave of sightings investigators later found  out the Ministry of Defense denied any knowledge  
of this sighting investigators found out however  that not only did they know about this sighting  
they'd conducted their own investigation into  it so yeah it's an incredible case there's  
been reunions among these students to this day it  affected them very deeply another case occurred on  
May 6 1977 this is back in California in Encinitas  California - at Ocean Knoll elementary school it's  
an amazing case involves about 15 students and at  least two teachers who are on at school when they  
watched this object suddenly come down next to  the school very low circling around the school  
and it had a huge porthole and they could see  humanoid figures inside they didn't get a good  
lat look at it before this thing actually landed  in this little Canyon next to the school and they  
didn't see a take-off they couldn't get close to  it because there was a fence and if the canyon was  
somewhat steep they went when were in class and  came out about an hour later on the playground  
when this object rose up from the canyon and began  to circle the school again at a altitude of about  
100 feet again it had a large large picture  when there were about four humanoids inside  
who the students described as perhaps wearing  masks or looking strange having lumpy faces one  
student had binoculars and actually looked at  these things through binoculars some students  
heard a low buzzing noise others said it was  completely silent and it circled the school for  
just a few minutes and then took off one of the  students went home that day and told her dad what  
happened he was shocked she's like yeah it had a  window it looked like two plates stuck together   it was totally silent he went to the school and  confronted the teachers teachers refused to verify  
it refused to talk about it teachers Eila actually  told the students not to talk about it he started  
questioning the students some students denied it  or admitted seeing something but said it wasn't   anything but he found some students who did give  a very good description and described the porthole  
and as well as seeing the humanoids so it's a  pretty well ver four by case he called the police  
who showed no interest he called the news who  showed no interest he eventually found a UF four   organization who agreed to take an interview but  it's a case that's gotten virtually no publicity  
whatsoever so many cases January 31st 1978 this  is at Montvale Memorial Elementary School in new  
jersey Montvale New Jersey three kids John Michael  and Eddie aged ten and eight years old saw this  
UFO hovering low over the playground they were  alone this was not a weekday but this was on the  
school playground and this object was hovering at  about five hundred feet when suddenly it dark no  
sense on a beam of light and then darts away and  moments later they see these weird figures walking  
down the street lining the school and they're  very strange because they're bald they've got  
very strange eyes and they're wearing yellow  jumpsuits and walking in a strange manner and  
the kids become concerned when suddenly this UFO  drops down out of the sky again very low and this  
time they see another humanoid it's much closer  it appears to be female and they're trying to  
figure out who this humanoid is when a police car  drives by the female humanoid disappears or turns  
invisible the police car leaves and this humanoid  reappears that's enough for the kids they run away  
they run home and one of them lives right next  to the school they tell the older brother and  
he looks out the window just in time to see this  object leaving they're hysterical they called the  
police the police come over can see that the boys  are absolutely sincere but don't know what to make  
of their story realize it's a UFO so they contact  UFO investigators and eventually this case reached  
UFO investigators Budd Hopkins Ted Fletcher and  Patrick Hugh who did a long interview with all the  
boys and found them perfectly credible but didn't  know quite what to make of the case particularly  
cuz it was right there next to the school another  case few years later one year later actually  
January 13th 1979 it's one of the strangest cases  twelve year-old Marcus Raphael Suarez is that  
Loretto school in Santiago del Estero this is an  Argentine his father is a janitor of the school  
so he'd sometimes accompany him and was alone in  the janitors office when suddenly a UFO showed up  
inside the room which was closed by the way the  door was closed and it was very small just a few  
feet across and two humanoids emerge from it and  one of them came over to Marco's grabbed him on  
the arm and pulled him onto a chair Marcos found  himself paralyzed one of beings left room briefly  
came back and they shined this weird red light  into Marcos's eyes and he passed out woke up he  
was very disoriented his face was hot and flushed  the room stunk badly he ran and got his father who  
smelled the strange odour saw his son's red face  and called authorities an investigation followed  
and it turned out that there was some evidence  supporting this people in the area suffered weird  
electronic disturbances one person's refrigerator  malfunctioned another person's fan stopped blowing  
it just cut out and several people reported static  weird static under radio so lots of cases of UFOs  
landing next to the school I've got just a few  more cases that I'd like to share with you one  
occurred on March 10th 1979 at view's Creek in  North Carolina there was only one witness to  
this because it occurred in the wee hours of the  morning this witness lives right next to Campbell  
College right on the border of the campus her  bedroom overlooks it and she woke up one day  
because her room was filled with light and she  looks out the window and is shocked to see a very  
large flying saucer landed on the campus this  is an area that was undergoing new construction  
and she said this thing was easily twice the size  of two tractors just enormous she doesn't say how  
the experience ended but what's very peculiar is  here's another object landing right next to this  
school another case occurred in Belgium in the  city of Haines alt Belgium two kids were walking  
to school and had just about reached the school  they could see the school and hovering right over   the school was a very large object suddenly it  swoops down and approaches them and lands next  
to them in a field and a door opens and a beam  comes out and waves them over they voluntarily  
walk on board and had a very pleasant encounter  with humanoid ETS who they said gave them you  
know a ride in the saucer and kind of took them  on a tour through space on a tour of the solar  
system which sounds outrageous but I have to tell  you there are many cases like this of kids who've  
you know we had sort of what amounts to a fun ride  in a UFO I've investigated one case personally I  
know ray Fowler said he had this experience for he  was taken as a kid and shown the planet Saturn one  
could I know saw had the same exact experience  they showed him Saturn so yeah these cases may  
sound strange but they do happen another case  occurred just a few years later at the tierra y  
libertad primary school where an object approached  and hovered next to the school over the telephone  
wires some said it actually appeared to land on  the transformer box there a door opened up and  
three humanoids exited they floated over the  telephone wires over a nearby house across the  
street over the fence and landed in the playground  right there on the playground itself one of the  
witnesses theresa Mayola said the figures were  glowing they were about four feet tall hairy and  
some teachers saw this UFO as well I don't know  if they saw the little beings which the children  
started to chase around the playground one of the  kids actually chased this being into the school  
halls itself I don't know how this case ended  but it was referred to me by Albert Rosales who  
brought this case to my attention and yeah one  of many cases which are occurring all over the  
world one case I investigated personally occurred  around 1982 to someone I've known for years and  
years I'll call her Melinda she doesn't want her  real name used she was a college student at the  
time she was near her home and was walking with  her dog late at night to go and retrieve a gross  
ricard that she had found lying abandoned next  to the school near her home and so she's walking  
by stag Street Elementary School which she had  attended by the way as a little girl now she's  
in college she's walking by the school taking  this cart along with her dog when she sees two  
children standing next to the school she thinks  their children but realizes you know it's after   11 o'clock at night it's pretty late for children  and as she approaches them she realizes they were  
bald they look very strange they're extremely  short and they're standing face to face right  
next to each other almost kissing but not kissing  so the behavior was very strange and now she gets  
within ten feet of them they turn and look at  her she locks gazes with them and she said it  
was like being woken up when you're already awake  they weren't human they had large dark eyes very  
pale white skin huge heads we're wearing green  suits with mandarin collars and freaked her out  
they were just floating there opened like a book  she said and just stared at her she quickly looked  
away and walked away as fast as she could without  running she didn't want to panic and I didn't  
look back her dog took nope no notice she had no  awareness of any missing time she didn't see any  
flying saucer or anything like that has had no  prior experiences or experiences after this but  
says that there could have been a UFO easily  landed in the playground which was surrounded  
on three sides by buildings horseshoe shaped  buildings and on the other side by trees so it  
could have easily remained hidden just a few more  cases I'd like to share with you another occurred  
actually at Roosevelt elementary school this is  now called great Springs Elementary School this  
occurred in Great Falls Montana May 1st 1997  a student saw this number of students saw this  
glowing object that looked like a rainbow  they said this little round glowing rainbow  
really pretty and one student was looking at it  became kind of disoriented times he had a weird  
sense of timelessness and suddenly the bell is  ringing which really confused him because he  
kept very close attention to time and whenever  anyone would line up after recess he would be  
the first in line to get back in school he was  shocked to find that he had completely missed  
the bell and ran up all the kids looked at him  strangely as if he had appeared out of nowhere  
and it was a very disorienting experience for  him he wondered if something else had happened  
and later that night he had a dream that he was  actually inside this object he saw other kids  
from the elementary school there and they were  all being given tests he said they were short  
humanoids he doesn't remember what they looked  like but the humanoids wanted to test these   children and psychic abilities apparently one test  involved telekinesis the kids had their hands held  
behind their back by some force while glowing  sticks like fire brands were thrown at them and  
the kids had to deflect them using telekinesis  mental powers another test was to take this box  
which was floating in front of them and change its  shape or turn it into a different direction it was  
a kind of a trick question because the only way  they could to complete the test successfully they  
had to turn the box inside out which took some  of them some time to figure out how to do it's  
a weird case but another apparent abduction I know  there's another case which occurred at paso tempo  
school this is where in- Garris where an employee  of the school heard another student screaming this  
is in Minas Gerais Brazil and saw a short humanoid  out the window wearing a black suit running across  
the campus another case probably the most famous  case of this kind is the Ariel elementary school  
this is September 16th 1994 rouha Zimbabwe at the  Ariel elementary school this is a pretty rural  
area it's got a very large playground yeah and on  September 16 that morning there was about 200 kids  
on the playground only one teacher who was minding  a snack bar usually there'd be more teachers but  
they were having a school conference at the time  so all these students were mostly alone on the  
playground when three glowing objects appeared  silver or glowing they look like orbs at first  
appeared to be following the telephone wires one  kid said and they can closer and closer to the  
school and finally one of these things landed it  looked like a classic flying saucer little legs on  
it portholes some kids said and landed right  next to the school at least 60 kids saw this  
it caused complete panic some of the students ran  to get help they went to the lady who was minding  
the snack bar she did not believe them meanwhile  the kids are crowding around at the edge of the  
playground here looking at this object when three  humanoids exit they were universally described  
as very short with very weird eyes and a dark  uniform otherwise there were minor Unitarians some  
said they did see hair on these on one of these  entities at any rate a smaller group of students  
did see these entities and one of them approached  right up to the students and kind of stared at  
them one of these students was a Salma siddik and  she was face to face with this one of these beings  
another was Emily trim Frances was another tool  ezel a lot of these kids actually got messages  
Emily trim said that the being communicated  telepathically with her and she had a flood  
of images and was all about technology and that we  there's a right way to use technology in a wrong  
way to use technology and we could do much better  another kid Frances was warned about pollution  
another child Lee Zell was warned that we need  to take care of the planet properly so they were  
given these sort of warnings about the environment  and the object didn't stay very long there's some  
confusion about time with some of the students and  eventually they being returned back into the craft  
which took off all the students ran in a group to  the teachers and they were hysterical the teachers  
were unable to calm them down for some time the  parents showed up to pick up their kids and of  
course the parents became upset some of the kids  walked home and said what happened and we're not  
believed others were because it was clear the  children were traumatized so this had a huge  
effect on the students the first investigators  showed up show up was Cynthia hind who talked to  
many of the students she realized this was a huge  case she contacted John Mack who went over there  
and interviewed the students not long after the  incident he also interviewed the headmaster Colin  
Mackey who verified that the students reported  this thing all the students drew pictures of  
what they had seen so it's yeah an incredible  case which sent shockwaves I think through the  
UFO community and the world and was really the  case that brought attention to schoolyard UFO  
sightings in a way that has never been brought  before and this case is still being research main  
researcher to this case is Randall Nickerson who  has put together a documentary called the aerial  
phenomenon which is due to be released shortly  he's worked on it for many years yeah it's an  
incredible case but not unique after I published  the book on about these incidents I was contacted  
by researcher ray Niro Hernandez of the free  organization who wanted me to know that he had  
talked to a teacher an elementary school teacher  who was at a primary school in Colombia in South  
America this is around the same time as the ruins  in Bob ley incident occurred and it was virtually  
identical a UFO landed next to the school was seen  by students beings came out messages were given so  
far there's been no formal interviews done so this  case is still pretty much up in the air but it  
does appear to have many not all the same elements  as the rural Zimbabwe case so just one more case  
I'd like to discuss occurred on April 30th 1998  and this occurred in Sri Lanka actually at a at  
akhirin primary school in Bandar danda rowella  Sri Lanka this was on April 30th 1998 some of  
the students arrived early to school to unlock  their classrooms and get everything ready these  
were the really good students you know the pupils  were excelled and her in line for scholarships  
when suddenly they heard this very large sound  very loud sound coming from the playground they  
ran out and were shocked to see this object which  wasn't very large it was like 20 feet across and  
had landed on the playground literally right next  to this I was there for only a few seconds when it  
took off like a bullet straight up and hovered  briefly and then disappeared all the students  
started showing up and the students who saw this  craft land pointed out the landing traces so they  
drew what they had seen as well the teachers  and the students were all very much impressed  
an investigation followed by researchers who found  out that it was not an isolated sighting the kids  
had been seeing a UFO over the school repeatedly  in the months before this they called the object  
coca or stork because it kept flying over this  school like a stork and turns out several adults  
around this time had also seen the UFO in the area  so that's a basic overview of all the landing and  
humanoid cases I did a full study of them again  in my book schoolyard UFO encounters there's more  
than hundred cases I suspect there's a lot more  than that because most people do not report these  
encounters and some of them have been covered up  I'm speculating here but I believe the purpose of  
these encounters is sort of an agenda of the UFOs  announcing their presence there does seem to be  
some cases involving direct contact messages and  even abductions so there is that but that seems  
to be much rarer usually these beings are just  getting out and showing themselves or landing  
I know of other cases there's a case in England  where people saw an object come over the school it  
stopped there was a porthole they saw human noise  another case about involving humanoids apparently  
in a school in Illinois another in Arizona  so I know there are more cases that I have  
not looked into it all so I'm pretty sure that  this is gonna happen again I suspect the reason  
the ETS are doing this is sort of a grassroots  movement because we know that they have gone to  
the government but the government has failed to  disclose the government has not been transparent  
or forthcoming or truthful about the subject so  I'm speculating that the ETS who want themselves  
known and who are pushing disclosure are putting  on these displays these publicity stunts and in  
attempts to announce their presence it's a very  clever ploy I think because it really convinces  
kids but sort of has a minimal effect on society  until later and it's been I think remarkably  
successful because today there is pretty much  a universal belief in UFOs among the younger  
generations so that's why I think that is  their real main agenda so that's it thank  
you very much again for listening once again yeah  that's it thank you very much and keep having fun.
