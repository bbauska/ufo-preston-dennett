A GHOST, A SPIRIT & A DEMON
Aug 12, 2022

Summary:
Aug 12, 2022
Since recorded history, people of all cultures across the world report seeing ghosts. They represent some of the best evidence we have for existence after death. But what many people don't know is that there are different kinds of ghosts.

For example, a typical ghost is simply an earthbound soul, someone who has remain attached to the Earthly plane. Ghosts remain earthbound for a variety of reasons. They might not realize they have passed on. They might be attached to a place or a person. They may suffer from confusion or addictions. Ghosts are responsible for the many haunted places across our planet

Then there are spirits. These are people who have passed on to the Other Side. They are aware that they are deceased and are no longer attached to the Earthly planes. Instead, they come to visit, usually with a purpose. They come to let their loved ones know that they are fine, to guide people, or to dispense information.

Then there are demons and poltergeists. Researchers are unsure about the origins of these entities. Some believe they are the result of psychokinetic energy from an emotionally disturbed person; others believe they are the result of uncontrolled mediumship, and others believe they are inhuman malevolent spirits. They can range from mischievous to downright evil.

This video presents three true accounts, one involving a ghost, one involving a spirit, and one involving a demon.

CASE ONE: THE GHOST WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE. Sarah first became aware of the ghost in her house when she heard an old man coughing. After several instances of this, she told her sister and mother, neither who believed her. Soon more events occurred. And then one day, Sarah not only heard coughing, she heard footsteps walk to the bathroom, then the door opened and closed, the ghost spit in the toilet and flushed it. Sarah ran screaming from the house. Still, neither her sister nor mother ever heard anything. Years passed with only occasional activity. One day they moved out and rented the house. Then one day the tenants called. They had experienced an event that left them baffled. Somebody had answered the phone. The problem was, the wife was alone in the house, and it wasn't her!

CASE TWO: A HAND ACROSS DEATH. One morning, Connie Lopez woke in her bedroom to find a strange mystery. An oily handprint had been left on her shower. She kept spotlessly clean house, so it didn't make any sense. Besides, the handprint was much larger than her own. She complained to her landlord, but he had no answers. Then it happened again! Connie woke one morning and discovered an oily handprint right on her own hand. A further investigation revealed fresh oil spots around her bed, and also around the dining room table. It was clear she had an intruder, but who? 

CASE THREE: A DEMON NAMED BART. Three young sisters and their friend decided that they were going to contact deceased celebrities using a Ouija board. They had done this several times before, but this time something different happened. The board began to spell out threatening messages. The girls asked the board who was communicating, and all it would say was that the spirit was in the house. And then they asked the spirit its name. The spirit spelled out the name Bart and said he was a demon. Frightened, the girls fled the house and decided to burn the Ouija board. But when one of them returned inside to get some matches, she was confronted with a sight that sent icy chills down her spine. It was a dark demonic spirit. And it wasn't going away anytime soon.

These three cases reveal the complexity of ghostly encounters and show how many different ways they are able to manifest. Ghost encounters can produce the entire range of emotions. As these cases show, some can be puzzling, some can be comforting, and some can be absolutely terrifying.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i'm going to do something a little different today i'm going to talk about ghosts i call this episode 
a ghost a spirit and a demon as i'm sure you know i normally focus on ufos but i've also 
done a lot of research into all aspects of the paranormal and that of course includes ghosts 
so i wanted to do this episode today to let people know that ghosts are real 
i've had my own experiences with ghosts i've investigated many hauntings of different types 
ghostly sightings have occurred for millennia all across the world in all cultures 
and uh i think people need to know that ghosts are real they provide 
very compelling evidence of life after death and they can manifest in a number of different ways i'm not sure people realize how many different types of hauntings there are 
so that's why i wanted to do this episode for you today and as the title of this episode implies 
there are three different types of hauntings i will be covering the first being a ghostly visitation ghosts are dead people who are basically earthbound for whatever reason they 
might not know they've passed away perhaps they're attached to the house or a person but this can be differentiated from the second story i'd like to talk about today 
which involves a spirit and a spirit is a deceased person who generally speaking 
knows that they are deceased has passed on moved to the other side but comes down to visit 
a person or a place for usually a specific purpose perhaps let this person know that 
they are all right on the other side or perhaps to complete some sort of unfinished business 
this sort of thing and then of course there's the third category which involves demons also 
also called poltergeists there's a lot of controversy and theories about what exactly 
demons and poltergeists are some believe this is just psychokinetic energy from an emotionally 
disturbed person some believe this is uncontrolled mediumship some believe these are actual inhuman 
spirits and they can be anything from mischievous to downright evil and i think you'll find 
these three cases quite compelling i certainly hope so so let's just get started and the 
first case i'm going to talk about again is a ghostly visitation involving what appears to be 
a deceased person who is earthbound and i call this case the ghost that answered the phone
this first case involves a woman i call sarah and as sarah says i don't want people to 
think i'm crazy this is the main reason why most people won't tell anyone about 
the ghost experiences they've had millions of intelligent competent people see ghosts 
and spirits but don't talk about them and if they do they often desire to remain anonymous 
sometimes it seems that people are more afraid of what other people will think of their ghostly encounter than of the encounter itself this is sometimes understandable because there are 
occasions when something so bizarre happens the witnesses can hardly believe it themselves so how 
can they expect anyone else to believe and that is what happened in this following account a mother 
and her two daughters lived alone in a house in the mountains of topanga canyon california 
and the middle daughter sarah the older daughter was the unfortunate witness to most of the ghost 
activity she tried to convince her family that there was a ghost in the house but her sister and 
her mother looked upon this subject with disbelief and the idea that their own house could be haunted 
seemed absurd the whole ordeal began one day in the mid 1970s when sarah was alone in the house 
and she thought she heard someone coughing in the back room in the first few times she simply 
ignored it but occasionally she would hear this very clearly and she knew she was completely alone 
each time she dashed to locate the sound but there was never anybody there 
it happened several times and she began to really wonder if there was a ghost in her house 
and she told her sister and her mom we have a ghost but they did not believe her but sarah had 
no doubt that their house was haunted after a particularly unnerving experience again 
she was alone in the house when she heard the sound of a man coughing she listened intently 
and what she heard next chilled her to the bone and she says i heard this coughing 
and then i heard somebody go into the bathroom close the door spit into the toilet and flush it 
and i freaked out i was like ah and i ran out i don't even remember what i did but i know that i 
left and i didn't go home until there was somebody else there sarah thought about telling her family 
what happened but knowing they wouldn't believe her she just kept it to herself so hearing the 
sound of this ghost coughing was pretty scary she remembers leaving the house more than once 
after this happened but after a couple of years she realized that the sounds had mostly stopped 
and she figured that the ghost was gone and thought no more about it it was a number of 
years later when everyone moved out and the house was being rented to a young couple the new tenants 
had never heard any of the ghost stories and sarah certainly wasn't about to tell them they had 
no reason to believe this house was haunted then in april of 1989 the ghost returned 
the new tenant the wife was alone in the house she turned the radio on loudly and went into 
the bathroom to take a shower she was in the middle of the shower when the phone rang she decided to just ignore the phone and continue her shower whoever it was she reasoned would call back 
the phone rang three maybe four times then stopped and she assumed that the caller had simply hung up 
what she didn't know however was that her husband was the one who was calling he had 
dialed his home number heard the phone ring and then heard somebody pick up the phone as he waited 
for his wife to say hello he heard a certain song playing on the radio in the background 
and to his surprise whoever answered the phone hung up on him so meanwhile 
his wife had quickly finished her shower and was drying off when the phone rang again 
it was her husband who was on the line and he asked angrily who's there who is there 
and his wife answered it's just me and he said well somebody just picked up the phone 
and she said no you must have dialed the wrong number and he disagreed he says no i hear the 
same song playing on the radio so this was proof that he had in fact dialed the correct number 
his wife told him that she had heard the phone ring but assumed that whoever it was had hung up 
but he said that it was he who had just called and somebody else answered the phone and hung up on him they were both perplexed by this incident but both of them jumped to the 
obvious conclusion there must be an intruder in the house so she quickly checked the entire house 
but as she suspected she was alone all the doors were locked they had never had any problems with 
intruders the house was quite isolated it just didn't make any sense still she became somewhat 
paranoid about someone being in the house particularly while she was taking a shower 
so she mentioned this incident to sarah the next time she spoke to her and asked if they had ever 
had any intruders before sarah listened carefully and before she knew what she was doing she said 
oh it's probably just the ghost so sarah was concerned that the couple might be somewhat 
frightened by this revelation instead they were actually relieved to find that this intruder was 
merely a ghost and not a physical intruder and while investigating this case i asked sarah if 
anybody had ever died in the house and she said that yes in fact two people had died in the house 
one of them had suffered from chronic emphysema and while he was living there his condition forced 
him to make frequent trips to the bathroom where he would cough and spit into the 
toilet afterwards he would of course flush the toilet he died in the house in the early 1970s 
and sarah says that the coughing she heard and the coughing of the men who died in the house sounded pretty much exactly the same and when she had this experience of hearing the bathroom door 
closed the man spit in the toilet flushing she was pretty sure that it was his spirit 
and when she heard the tenant's story she was surprised that this ghost was still around but she 
was also happy that she at last had confirmation there were other witnesses she wasn't the only one 
who had met the ghosts so in this case the ghost was able to close doors flush toilets answer the 
phones as well as produce sounds of coughing and spitting this is fairly typical of many 
hauntings in some cases it is because of a sudden death it seems that the deceased do not know that 
they are dead and they continue on with the same behavior that they exhibited before their death 
because of the shock of a sudden death they may have sometimes trouble thinking clearly enough 
to realize that they are in fact in the next dimension and that seems to be the situation in 
this case today the haunting has apparently ended the house has been sold and the new residents 
have no idea that the house was once haunted by a restless spirit so that's quite an interesting 
case what i like about this case is it shows how a ghost is able to manipulate the environment in a 
number of different ways physically moving objects also they know the identity of this ghost it's a 
multiple witness case it's a very interesting case and there are many cases of ghosts that 
have answered phones so that's why i wanted to present that particular story to you today 
and now we move to the second case which involves a spirit visitation 
and again spirits are deceased people who know that they are deceased have moved on 
but sometimes come to visit people for various reasons and i call this case a hand across death 
well many ghosts are people who aren't aware that they have died this is not always the case 
some ghosts know perfectly well they have died and we call these spirits these usually appear 
as i said because they have a purpose some unfinished business to resolve this could be 
anything from revealing a hidden will to exposing the guilt of one's murderer to letting someone 
know that they are okay on the other side in the following case it was unrequited love that caused 
a spirit to return from the other side while many spirits manifest in the form of apparitions odors 
or unexplained sounds this spirit was actually able to leave physical evidence of its presence 
the main witness in this case is connie lopez she's the mother of three grown children 
at the time of this case she worked full time and lived alone in her home in west hills 
this is in california she had never seen a ghost before in her entire life but all that changed in 
september 2001. as connie says this is what happened i got up as regular the everyday 
normal thing to go and get ready for work the first thing i did was to go into the shower 
when i opened the door i saw a hand print an oily hand print on the tile 
and i was in shock because of the fact that i don't like anything dirty or greasy in the house 
and to see that handprint on the tile it just got me really scared because i thought somebody was in 
the house it was really strange i put my finger on it and i smelled it and it was oil it was a 
handprint what i even did was put my hand close to it to see if it was a bigger hand or a smaller 
hand it was bigger than mine i mean i really got scared it was regular car oil i touch it with one 
of my fingers real lightly and i smelled it and i thought car oil who would be in my house with 
car oil i'm really spotless so i was very surprised it was i was really really surprised 
i thought who in the heck but i just got really scared and i scrubbed it off 
so connie checked the rest of the house to make sure all the windows and doors were locked she called the manager and asked if anybody had entered her home for repairs she checked 
the bathroom thoroughly for any possible source of the oil nothing could explain it as connie 
says it really scared me because i kept thinking god i wonder if somebody's finding a way to come 
into my house so connie tried not to think about it she already had enough problems to think about 
six months earlier her ex-husband mario that's not his real name whom she hadn't seen in 20 years had 
called her up out of the blue he needed a place to live he worked as a trucker and he really only 
wanted a small place to store his things and he said that most of the time he would be out on the road he wouldn't bother her and connie surprised herself by agreeing to rent 
a room to him in her house her only condition was that he keep the house clean he was a trucker a 
mechanic and was often fixing his truck and repairing it and when he'd come home connie 
always made him leave his boots on the doorstep so he wouldn't track anything into the house 
and mario happily obliged otherwise they lived together in harmony platonically mario however 
never wavered in his love for connie in all the years following their divorce 
he called her on every one of her birthdays every major holiday christmas and so forth 
connie assured him that their relationship was over but mario kept professing his undying love 
for her despite the awkwardness of this living situation things were going well then tragedy 
struck mario went out to a party and never came home connie learned that he had suffered a massive 
heart attack and died on the scene he was only 49 years old connie was of course heartbroken 
she was surprised to learn that mario actually knew he had a heart condition and was likely to 
die soon and yet he chose to live the last months of his life with her and now he was dead so connie 
was already upset and grieving and now she had the added problem of a possible intruder in her home 
she couldn't explain this oily handprint it just didn't make sense so she tried not to think about 
it but then a few days later this unknown intruder returned as connie says and i quote i woke up i 
set up and i fixed my bed like normal i started walking down the hall and i turned the light on 
and the bathroom's really nice and bright because of the window i put my hand on the handle to open 
the shower and i saw this hand print right on my hand i mean there was an oily handprint on 
top of my hand like somebody had grabbed my hand and left their handprint right on top of my hand
it must have happened when i was asleep or something when i looked at it i said oh my god 
what and i put my finger again to touch it it was oil i smelled oil was car oil on my hand 
but that's not even it what happened was i got scared i walked into my room i looked around my 
room i pulled the sheets up to see if there was any oil on the bed anywhere i turned on 
the lights i opened the blinds and guess what there were oil spots around my bed as a matter 
of fact the oil spots are still around the bed like somebody went around the bed dropping oil 
connie was shocked she hurriedly wiped the oil off of her hand cleaned up the mess around her bed 
again she checked all the doors and windows even the ceiling looking for a solution to this mystery 
she says i was in shock i was totally in shock but then what i realized is when i came 
downstairs in my dining area someone went around my dining area with oil they did the same thing 
around my dining area like they purposefully went around the table just splattering it 
not like little drops here and there but like somebody got a can of oil and was just making lines back and forth streaks and lines of oil i said something's wrong here who would come in my 
house and just splatter oil all over my carpet and only around the dining area which was so 
strange because it stayed mostly on the corner i couldn't believe it i had bar stools and it was 
right around the bar stools like somebody just sat there splattering it was just so puzzled 
about it i could not even believe it again connie assumed that someone must have come into the house 
she called the manager again and accused him of having given away her keys the manager denied it 
she asked them again if they had come to the house with oil to make repairs and the manager said no 
connie then told the manager what was going on the manager was as mystified as she was 
and assured her that it wasn't the building and it wasn't him the carpet itself was new so there didn't seem to be any explanation so connie began the difficult 
task of cleaning up this oil and this is when she had a sudden revelation she remembered doing 
this before having to clean up oil stains on her carpet in fact over and over again mario 
would come to the house with his oily hands his boots and clothes and leave oil stains all 
over the couch the floor the counters wherever he touched it it infuriated her and she knew it so as 
she's cleaning up his oil and thinking this chills started to race down her spine all the pieces 
fell into place mario's obsessive love for her his profession as a truck driver and a mechanic 
connie's obsessive need for cleanliness mario's death her devastation at his death 
and now all this oil all over her house the handprint in the shower the handprint on her hand 
the answer was so obvious that she was surprised she hadn't thought of it sooner 
it was mario this was mario's ghost trying to get in contact with her trying to communicate to her 
that he was all right as connie says he was a truck driver he was always messing around with oil 
always he was fixing his car cleaning his truck and i always used to tell him you need to take 
off your boots outside do not come in the house with your boots because they're full of oil 
and that's when it dawned on me i kept thinking to myself oh my god i was so scared but it really 
honestly happened it happened to me twice and i can't believe when i was looking for the oil 
why would somebody put oil all around my bed and put oil all around my dining area 
so now connie believes that mario came back and as kind of a personal joke left oily handprints and 
stains around her house one last time connie says can you believe that like he's saying now i'm gone 
now what are you going to do you know what i mean you can't say anything anymore and here 
are these oily stains oh my god i was so scared at first i was really shocked but after that 
everyone kept telling me he really cared about you and that's why he probably tried to come back 
but to throw oil to tell me now what are you going to do well he let me know he's been here that he's 
been in my house believe me i have the oil stains still in my bedroom so connie told mario's family 
what happened and to her shock they told her that mario had also appeared to them his daughter and 
the neighbor's three-year-old little girl each claimed to have actually seen his apparition 
so they all believed connie and were amazed at how mario was able to manifest his presence 
to her and using car oil was the perfect way to let her know that it was really him so while it 
was initially kind of scary for connie she now receives a measure of comfort from her experience 
the cow the carpet is now permanently stained as a reminder of her experience and she even 
rearranged her furniture to cover the stains because as she says every time i see it 
it's kind of scary i hope i never have to experience something like that again 
so i love this second case again we know who this spirit was and it this case shows how 
ghosts or spirits rather are able to manifest in really unique ways and provide physical evidence 
of their existence after having passed on it's truly a remarkable case and now we move to the 
third case which involves an apparent demonic haunting again researchers disagree on exactly 
what is going on here some believe these are human spirits some believe this is just 
uncontrolled medium shifts some believe that these are inhuman spirits some evil force of some kind
but any rate i think you'll find this case particularly compelling and i call this case 
a demon named bart so this next case as many demonic hauntings do began when three children 
began to use a ouija board these girls lived in their house with their parents in their home 
in malibu they were three sisters they lived a normal childhood going to school making friends 
doing their chores but one day in 1975 they began to experiment with the ouija board 
at first it was fun they took a piece of paper and wrote down the alphabet in numbers 
then they took a penny and each of them put one finger on it and to their surprise and delight 
the penny moved and spelled out intelligible messages as jennifer the younger sister says 
we would do this every so often would make a ouija board out of a sheet of paper and a copper penny 
we were so young i didn't think any of us were up to pranks it seemed so real that it was happening 
there was no questioning it we were these young kids and we were playing with this stuff and 
it was all kind of just happening kelly the middle sister became intrigued with the idea 
of contacting the spirits of famous people as kelly says i don't know what got me hooked on jack 
benny when i was little but i just tried so hard to contact him he was my favorite and 
i know i used to contact someone that used to respond to jack benny i don't know if it was him or not but i thought it was agnes morehead was another one of my favorites 
we just tried to reach people like that we played with the ouija board so much when we were little 
and never had the problem of running into something that was scary so the three 
sisters spent many hours trying to contact various spirits and then one night in 1975 
they and their friend amy had a frightening encounter with a bad ghost at this time jennifer was six years old kelly was nine amy was 12 and her friend heidi was also 12. 
they gathered together on the outside deck and drew up one of their homemade ouija boards they all sat around put a finger on the penny and at first they tried to contact 
jack benny as kelly says i thought that had success in reaching him before i don't know 
i mean i don't know why the hell jack benny would be wanting to talk to me but we were definitely going in that direction of trying to reach him 
so normally the ouija board would spell out hello and give various puzzling messages 
however this time it did something very different as jennifer says we were all excited and started 
asking questions anyway it just started to not give us answers or not the answers we were 
looking for it started jumbling words letters and words the penny would go really fast off the paper 
you'd have your finger on it and it would move quickly off the paper either with your finger or leaving it behind it never flew off the table or anything but it would just move across the paper 
so the four young girls looked at it in confusion why wasn't this ouija board 
behaving they continued probing the spirit trying to get coherent answers 
about who it was and they were not at all prepared for what it was about to tell them as kelly says 
what i remember was that we made a ouija board out of paper we were trying to just get anybody to 
communicate with us so we weren't very careful we just opened it up to whoever wanted to come in and 
talk to us it was fine we thought we were going to try to go for certain people that we wanted 
to talk to but we weren't getting any response and then all of a sudden started moving around 
it wouldn't give us who it was but it kept saying that it was really close and we knew by asking it 
are you in our house and it said it was in the house and it wouldn't give us any name but it 
wasn't very friendly i just remember it not being terribly friendly friendly it's kind of hostile or 
aggressive i don't remember the questions we asked it but i do remember we got really scared because 
it said it was in the house why we were scared i don't know if it told us that it was mean or not 
i know we talked to it for a while i don't remember the specifics but for some reason 
we got the impression that this was not a nice spirit that's why we were scared of it 
it started moving and all of a sudden it was like i didn't know who we were dealing with and we made him spell out his name and it was just scary it turned scary solely through 
whatever this thing was saying to us because we had done it enough times where it wasn't scary 
it wasn't like we were scared to begin doing it so jennifer remembers the same thing that the spirit 
said it was in the house and like the other girls she was anxious to know exactly who it was 
it was pretty obvious it wasn't agnes morehead or jack benny and this spirit kept avoiding revealing 
its name and would only say it's close by in the house so the girls were insistent and demanded 
that the spirit reveal who it was and finally the spirit did spell out its name and this is 
when all four girls became terrified as jennifer says it started jumbling letters and words was 
definitely playing with us scaring us and then whoever we were speaking with us just told us 
that we were talking to someone related to satan and that his name was bart and he was a demon 
and obviously it totally freaked us out we were all really terrified the thing that was so weird 
and i remember all these things so clearly because we were so terrified i remember he 
said he was a demon i think at first he said he was satan and we were asking about that and being 
afraid and then he divulged that he was a demon and gave his name it was really kind of strange 
so at this point the girls were literally trembling with fear had they invited the devil himself into their house it didn't seem possible but this spirit kept 
saying he was in the house waiting for him and it was heidi who finally hit upon a plan of action 
as jennifer says what ended up happening is he said he was in our house and heidi told us 
the only way to get rid of the spirit is to burn the ouija board so my older sister amy 
was hysterical and grabbed me and we went outside and grabbed one of the dogs 
the four of them decided that kelly would go in the house and get matches to burn the ouija board 
they had several dogs one of them was a young doberman named gandalf and as soon as kelly opened 
the door gandalf ran excitedly into the house and started barking furiously at somebody or something 
kelly ran after the dog she had no idea that she was about to come face to face with this demon 
as kelly says we decided we had to burn the ouija board this is what our friends said we had to get 
rid of the spirit and just break the connection that we had invited to have in our house so 
somebody had to go inside and get the matches and i was volunteered i don't know why i took our dog 
we went past the sliding glass door and the dog took off down the hall barking i went running 
after it calling it and the dog was going absolutely ballistic barking and screaming 
and looking up the stairway there was nobody there there was nobody home except us kids kelly ran to 
the foot of the stairs and grabbed gandalf and looking up she got the shock of her life as she 
says i saw a shadow or something in the stairway i don't know it was pretty spooky it was just a 
grayish i mean something moved was not necessarily a figure i could make out but there was something 
that moved along the wall i don't know what i was seeing the dog and i were looking at the same area 
so i finally got the dog under control and went flying out of the house with some matches 
i have no idea what the dog was barking at we burned the ouija board and basically 
stayed under the house until my mom got home and jennifer confirms this as jennifer says the dog 
ran down the hallway and just started turning circles and barking at the end of the hallway kelly ran into the house and kelly swears she thought she saw a shadow or something 
while she was trying to grab the dog we burned the ouija board and we just sat outside 
and my mom came home so their mom comes home and finds all the girls under the 
house cowering in fear the girls quickly spilled out their story and as kelly says she came in 
walked around the house and there was nothing the dog was fine when we walked in the house it 
kind of walked around we took it to the stairway and nothing so i have no clue what was going on 
i don't know what led it down the hallway to bark other than thinking that something was there
kelly tried to shove the incident out of her mind she says i don't have a real vivid 
memory because of the dog situation and being in the house pretty much scared me to death so about all i remember from that day is being the one suckered to go inside 
so after that incident the mother sat them down and explained to them all about the spirit world 
uh turned out that their mother had had a number of ghost encounters the family had a rich history 
of psychic activity and apparently the mother had some media mystic talent 
their mother whose name is ardell had several experiences with ghosts so she totally believed 
her daughters however later ardell would have a terrifying encounter in this house apparently 
involving this same ghost it's important to note that ardell had also used the ouija board and one 
evening she went to bed normally but in the middle of the night something woke her up and tried to 
pull her out of bed as ardell says i was alone in the house i was upstairs in my bedroom in bed 
and all of a sudden something somebody was trying to pull me out of bed i remember grabbing onto the 
sheets and yelling i had a doberman at the time she must have been about 11 when this happened she 
was asleep at the end of the hall i remember she was a very sound sleeper i had been delving into 
psychic phenomena and i immediately figured that somebody was trying to make contact with me but i 
couldn't understand why i was being pulled out of bed i said get your hands off of me i remember i 
held onto the sheet and was grabbing at the bed so that i wouldn't be pulled onto the floor that was 
so distinct what i felt was like two hands pulling at me like somebody had the back of my nightgown 
or something and was pulling me they weren't actually touching me they weren't pinching me 
but they were pulling at my bed clothes to pull me out of bed and i was holding on and i finally just 
yelled let me alone at which point the whole thing whatever the force was just totally disintegrated 
i sat up turned on the lights and went through the whole house when i got up of course my dog 
went with me we went through the whole house turned on all the lights inside and out i 
didn't see anything i couldn't understand it it was so real i thought there was somebody maybe 
a robber or somebody in the house but i couldn't understand how it could have gotten by my dog 
so ardell found that quite frightening assumed it was just a singular incident but it was just a few 
weeks later when she had another very bizarre experience when she distinctly heard somebody 
calling her name as she says it was coming from the front of the house by my front door 
it was not a voice i remember it was just somebody saying ardell ardell ardell and by the third time i was running towards the front hall 
i didn't see anything i didn't hear anything i went back and i sat in bed totally confused 
so this case is typical of what can happen when people use ouija board 
it appears that the ghost is able to manifest more easily when people use a ouija board 
however they had used the ouija board for quite some time without l effects and as it turns 
out ardell and kelly in particular are both very psychic have had out-of-body experiences 
precognition and ardella's had several ghost encounters so perhaps this is uncontrolled 
mediumship perhaps by using the ouija board they invited an evil spirit into their home they're 
not sure but the good news is the haunting ended they have suffered no further negative encounters 
however with their track record it's likely they will probably see ghosts again so those are the 
three cases i wanted to present to you today i did write about these cases in my book california 
ghosts true hauntings in the golden state and i wanted to present these three cases again 
to provide good evidence that there is life after death that ghosts are real and to let 
people know that there are many different types of hauntings and that ghosts can manifest in a wide 
variety of ways so it's not just these three types of hauntings you know a ghost a spirit 
and a demonic hunting there's also another type of haunting called a residual haunting 
which is basically just echoes of people who have passed on but that's a story for a later time 
i'd like to thank you all for watching i truly appreciate it i hope you're doing 
well and until next time keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun.
