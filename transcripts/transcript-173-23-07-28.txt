UFO encounters are known for high strangeness. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences – all often contain bizarre aspects that defy explanation. The question is, why? Is this an intentional act on the part of the ETs to encourage us to seek new answers? Here are 10 weird UFO cases of extreme high strangeness that might help answer these questions.

WEIRD EFFECTS FROM A UFO. In Nov 1953, Trygve Jansen and Gudrun Buflod drove along the Mossevei Road by Gjresjoen Lake in Norway. Suddenly a UFO dropped from the sky, swooped at their car and blocked their path on the road. After a short stand-off, the object flew away. The weirdness wasn't over. The UFO affected the watch Trygve wore, the car he was driving, and caused strange physiological changes in both witnesses.

A UFO IN DISGUISE. On Jul 2, 1954, Mrs. R and 8 family members drove along Highway 97 near Crater Lake, OR. Low on gas, they decided to stop at the next gas/food stop. Up ahead, they saw a brightly-lit café all by itself by the highway. Their car died and they rolled into the parking lot. The building was round and covered with lights. Inside, they were amazed to see curved mirror-like walls, translucent tables, and a waiter and waitress only four feet tall and dressed in silver uniforms. The high strangeness had just begun.

A UFO DEPOSITS UNKNOWN MATERIAL. On May 10, 1957, Michel Fekete rode his bicycle on his way home in Beaucourt sur L’Ancre, France. A bright light on the road ahead dazzled him and he saw 4 short menacing figures approach. He ran to the neighbors, and they all watched for the next 20 minutes as the figures darted back and forth. The object departed, but it left behind patches of a strange black, elastic material.

THE ALIEN ROBOTS. On Oct 23, 1965, James Townsend was 4 miles from his home in Long Prairie, MN when a rocket-shaped UFO landed on the road in front of him. Several tiny tin-can-shaped robotic figures exited the craft and began to approach. James had the feeling they were watching him. Little did he know, many people in the area were also seeing UFOs.

CHASED BY A UFO. At 8:00 a.m., on April 8, 1966, Gary Hunt and Mike Dorsey (both age 12) were walking to school in Norwalk, CT when a UFO swooped over their heads. It then made a U-turn in the sky and swooped down again, and then a third time. The boys fled in panic. The UFO chased them into the woods, forcing them to hide under a bridge. Other people in the area watched their ordeal. Later, the boys were questioned by a secret govt agent.

“I WAS SHOT BY AN ET RAY-GUN!” On Sep 3, 1976, Joao Romeu Klein was walking to his home in Santa Catarina, Brazil. A flying disc approached and hovered ahead of him on the path. A red beam of light shone down and deposited 3 dwarf-like figures who blocked his path. Then the UFO darted behind Joao, blocking his escape. Joao threw his work-knife at the creatures. But they responded by aiming a ray-gun at him, striking him with a beam of light.

UFO PREDICTS FATAL BUS ACCIDENT. On Mar 18, 1988, a bus carrying 22 members of a religious sect plummeted from a mountain highway, killing 4 passengers and injuring 18 others. The driver (who had been drinking) was charged with murder. The head of the sect, Peter Thomas, revealed that the group had seen a UFO, and that night, he had dreamed about the UFO, which warned him that a tragic accident would occur.

BURNED BY A UFO. On Mar 31, 1980, two circus employees (Paride Orfei and Phelipe Garcia) stood by the circus tent in Gioia del Colle, Italy when a bright light zoomed down and hovered overhead. It stayed only briefly but caused the circus animals to react strangely. Seconds later, it darted away. That’s when both men realized that they had been burned by the UFO.

THE UFO WITH TENTACLES. On Oct 27, 1981, three young girls (Pia Andersson, Carina Sjostrom and Anna-Karin Lindahl) rode their horses near their homes in Kvilla, Sweden. The horses were acting up when a glowing disc dropped from the sky and hovered overhead. It had weird tentacle-like appendages around the perimeter. All the girls were paralyzed in fear. Finally, the object left, and the girls galloped home.

THEY LOOKED LIKE BAGS. Late at night on Nov 2, 1989, two truck drivers, Oleg Kirzhakov and Nikolai Baranchikov encountered a landed UFO on a remote highway near Arkhangelsk, Russia. The truck engine died, so Oleg went to investigate the craft. At first a weird forcefield prevented his progress. But then a door opened, and weird bag-shaped figures emerged. The next thing Oleg knew, he was being taken onboard.

These encounters all contain unique and bizarre elements of high strangeness and show just how bizarre UFO contact can be. And yet, many also have physical evidence: landing traces, medical affects, EM effects, animal reactions and more. These very weird cases have something very important to teach us about UFOs and extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the 
Paranormal I call this episode so weird 10 true UFO cases of extreme High strangeness 
these cases are really off the charts when it comes to weird they all involve a different variety of cases so we're looking at sightings Landings face-to-face 
encounters onboard experiences really the whole gamut and these are cases that do span several 
decades and definitely come from all over the world that involve all kinds of witnesses some 
are multiple witness cases the vast majority of these cases also have physical evidence 
but all of them have some really strange aspects to them some I don't think I've ever heard before 
so that's why I really wanted to do this video for you today because I think it 
shows how truly bizarre UFO encounters can be and how much we have to learn from them 
each case does add to our knowledge of the UFO phenomena and I think these cases especially do 
because some of them as I said have really unique aspects to them so the first case that I'd like 
to present today I call weird effects from a UFO and this one occurred in Gerson Lake Norway it 
involves two witnesses who are driving along the highway when they encountered a UFO and the weird 
effects from this one yeah I've never heard this before so I think you'll find it quite interesting
this case took place in November 1953 and involves two witnesses trig Johnson and good run beauflaud 
this is a man and a woman and they were driving along the mosavi road and this circumnates the 
massive Jerusalem Lake and I'll just quote trig directly as he says we noticed a luminous object 
that did not go straight ahead high up but that really was maneuvering around at a low altitude 
sometimes it disappeared out of sight but all of a sudden it was back again flying in wide circles 
over the woods and the lake then it came down low close to the sides of the car and on one occasion 
I had to move away as far as I could when the thing swept close past the door of the car 
so this thing is coming so close to the car it's practically touching it and this is when Trigg told his passenger gudran another thing like that and they will stop the car 
so trig continues his story as he says just as if my words had been comprehended by the driver 
of this strange craft it made an attempt to turn and kept right towards us it came down over the 
road some 10 meters in front of us it did not land on the road but hovered a bit above it 
nor did it stand still but moved gently to and fro in our Direction well there it was a flying saucer 
so this object was pretty small just big enough to block the road according to trig 
it was yellowish in color but it had a red hot ring around the circumference and a dome on top 
and on either side it seemed to be releasing some sort of glowing gas or steam that almost 
looked like wings he says and this was much more prominent when it was flying but when it stayed 
still right in front of them on the road these became much shorter and as Triggs says in his own 
words I had an intense feeling that something or somebody within gazed at the two creatures 
who were sitting in the Earthbound vehicle the car feeling small and foolish for my part I've 
never felt too small or gotten such a dizzying perception of the infiniteness of the universe 
I was never scared stiff in a manner unexplainable but yet obvious it felt as if a message from the 
space visitors reached me it told me he was friendly and that we had nothing to fear 
the soothing influence was indeed needed we had no idea why what might happen in the next second 
The Apparition hovered there close to us for about a minute but these 60 seconds seemed to last as long as 60 hours presently the Brilliance increased the wings 
extended and the craft took off it went over the automobile so low that I felt it grazed the top 
then it climbed right up flew across the lake away over the woods so this object was totally silent 
during the whole encounter but as it disappeared they heard a quote dull bang like thunder 
so if all of that is not weird enough that this UFO kept swooping towards the car blocking 
the road and then flew right at the car almost hitting the roof what happened next is very weird 
drigg reports that after the encounter his face and hands were sunburned but his friend goodrun reports that both her arms or at least one of them remained 
paralyzed for some time after the encounter to the point that she could not even hold her purse 
so these are pretty intense physiological effects but wait there's more Triggs watch stopped at the 
exact moment the saucer blocked them on the road and he did try to get it fixed but the watch 
repairman said that he was unable to fix it and that it appeared as if the watch had been quote 
over magnetized and then it gets even more weird when Trigg and his passenger arrived home trigg's 
wife greeted them outside of the doorway and exclaimed Heavens Trigg have you bought a new car 
and I'll just let trig explain what she means by this as Triggs says she could not be convinced that the car was the usual old one until she had inspected its interior 
indeed its exterior showed something different its usual beige yellow color had disappeared 
instead it shown a beautiful Verdigris green like phosphorizing so kind of glowing almost 
unfortunately this new color did Fade Away pretty slowly but it did fade away 
so as goodrun says this could not be due to any imagination of my wife certainly she had not the 
faintest idea of our Strange encounter so yeah it changed the color of the car that's not weird 
I don't know what is uh they both later learned that people in the area had also seen UFOs around 
the same time but meanwhile the strange effects continued the next day they had a party and Trig's 
wife prepared dinner but neither trig nor good run had any appetite whatsoever they couldn't eat 
as Trigg says neither Ms blue fod or I could get down the slightest bit of food nor did we 
feel like telling the people of our experience we felt altogether two dazed and overwhelmed 
needless to say this encounter changed changed Triggs mind about UFOs and as he 
says in his own words I have never been specially interested in the phenomenon called flying saucers 
I've never believed nor disbelieved now I am compelled to believe in what I myself and 
another person of good judgment have seen the most peculiar thing was I thought the mystical 
stranger chose my little car as an object for study and I'm glad I was not alone had I been 
alone I am afraid that I at times would have doubted what I myself had experienced 
so yeah I mean he thinks that's the strangest part I honestly think the strangest part is that 
his car changed color but yeah it appears that this for whatever reason 
UFO targeted his car maybe they changed it on purpose I don't know it's it's weird but 
trig does have a final end note he says that he regretted not having his camera with him which 
he had actually planned to take but had forgotten and he now carries it with him at all times but 
as he says I rather wish I would be spared from meeting another saucer a really remarkable case 
I mean this is a UFO that actually changed the color of someone's car and some very interesting 
physiological effects as well so yeah off the charts weird and here's another case of 
a kind that I have heard before but this is such a good example I call this one a UFO in disguise 
and this took place very close to Crater Lake in Oregon and well I'll just get into the case 
because it kind of speaks for itself quite a few Witnesses in this one and this has got to be one 
of the weirdest encounters I've ever heard this case took place in July 2nd 1954 and is definitely 
one of the weirdest I've ever heard it comes from apro the aerial phenomenon research organization 
and coral Lorenzen writing about this case called it one of the most interesting reports she had 
received and says we have presented it because of the radical departure from known descriptions of 
other similar cases which is putting it lightly I think so this case comes from a lady who wishes 
to remain anonymous they call her Mrs r and Mrs R was on vacation with her mother brother sister 
two daughters a step-daughter and two nephews so quite a large family and they were driving along 
U.S Highway 97 in Oregon heading north as you can see here and they were southeast of Crater 
Lake they estimate about 10 miles south of the Junctions between Highway 97 and Highway 138 
and they noticed they were beginning to get low on gas and so they were hoping to reach a food and gas stop so they were looking for some place to stop and coming around a corner 
in the highway they found a place to stop it was this very unusual looking restaurant 
they described it as being very large perfectly round brilliantly illuminated 
just really beautiful and as they drove up to it their car engine died and they coasted into 
a quote beautiful covered parking area they did notice three or four other cars there 
and they also noticed unusually bright lights were shining down from this apparent building 
so they went inside and they found themselves in this bright circular room and they were 
immediately entranced because it looked so weird inside the walls they said looked mirror-like 
they sat down at a little table which also struck them as very unusual because it appeared to be 
made of what looked like glass or plexiglass the whole thing they've never seen a table like that 
so Mrs R's brother his name is Cliff he started looking around and he motioned 
them to look at the adjoining room through a little doorway there so they got up and they looked at this other room which was also perfectly round and had lots 
of Windows all the way around the circumference but they were all about two feet from the ceiling 
and they also said that the interior of this structure was very brightly lit 
and it gets weirder so they're sitting there at their table and a waiter and waitress approach 
and boy did they look weird they were both blonde very petite they looked almost identical 
as if they could be brother and sister but get this they were about four and a half feet tall 
and to put the icing on the cake they and all the other quote employees all 
wore these weird silver uniforms and Boots the boots had a black trim on the Soles and heels 
so they were they looked strange they had strange clothes and they certainly acted strange because 
the waiter and waitress they said spoke with the voices that were oddly soft and kind of musical 
so Mrs R remembers telling her mother that this place was quote really unbelievable so they do 
have some memory issues with what happened they did order a meal they remember eating they don't 
remember what they don't remember what they said there really wasn't a whole lot of conversation 
but she does remember paying the bill going up to this little round-shaped booth paying the bill and 
then exiting the establishment now when they got into the car it wouldn't start but they coasted 
out onto the highway and the car immediately started and they drove off now at this point they 
saw their tank was half full which was a little unusual because they thought it was less than that 
so they continued their drive up to Highway 138 which was 10 miles ahead 
and they saw workmen in with snow plows clearing the road to Crater Lake and Mrs R stopped and 
asked them about this weird new Cafe that they had stopped by 10 miles back along Highway 97. and she 
said that the man operating the snowplow looked at her as quote as if I was a nut or something 
so she didn't know what to make of that they still hadn't really put the pieces together at this point they drove up to the next city Chenault and they got gas and I was at this 
point that Mrs R's stepdaughter announced that she had forgotten her purse at the restaurant 
so they turned around and headed south back down Highway 97 to the location of the restaurant 
but it was gone they could not find it so they're driving down the road looking for it Cliff this 
is our's brother offered the explanation that maybe they had taken the wrong road 
but Mrs R pointed out that there was no other Road there is just Highway 97 that's it so they drove 
past the spot where they thought this restaurant was still looking for it and finally they knew 
that there was no way it could be farther ahead on the road they turned around again still didn't 
see it drove all the way back up to the city of Chenault and they went to this restaurant and by 
coincidence those same workmen who are operating the snow plows were there so they again asked them 
about this weird new restaurant and once again these workmen gave them really strange looks 
and so they didn't know what to make of that they returned from their vacation and here's where it 
gets even weirder they completely forgot about the incident for at least a few years until suddenly 
Mrs R recalled the experience and it took a while for her memory to come completely back 
and finally she asked her mother if she remembered this weird restaurant and the mother said and I 
quote yes I remember but sometimes when I think of it now I have a funny feeling like maybe we were 
we were a surprise to them meaning the people at the quote restaurant and Mrs I remembered 
another detail which really baffled her she literally called that when they had arrived 
at the city of Chenault after visiting this restaurant and paying for their food she thought 
well she had the same amount of money so she could not have paid for the food at the restaurant 
she kept very very careful watch of how much money she had and she still had all her money 
so they later went back to this spot several times looking for this restaurant and of course there 
was no sign of it so this is a remarkably weird case but I do know of others like it 
there was another case where a gentleman and his family overheated on a highway in 
Nevada and he opened the radiator cap and got a real bad burn on his hand 
and they were driving to town and Came Upon a hospital which treated them for his burn 
and later they found out that this hospital did not even exist so there's another case of a UFO in Disguise and there are others but Hopkins talks about a case 
involving Debbie Jordan Cobble who thought she was going to a 7-Eleven of course that's not what 
it was at all it turned out to be a UFO and if I remember correctly John Mack had a very similar 
case involving kids who went to a fun house or an arcade so apparently these things do happen 
I really wish there was more follow-up on that particular case but as you can see it's not the 
only example of this I'm thinking that sometimes UFOs will sort of put themselves in disguise 
this I think might fall under the category of screen memories but that usually involves just 
the ETS and not so much the UFO itself but yeah as you can see in this case it does it's such a weird 
case and here's another one I like this case it's very interesting lots of witnesses and some really 
strange physical evidence as well and I call this case a UFO deposits unusual material and this one 
took place in France in Boku let's let me see if I can get this right in vocor Sur long cray France 
and there's a lot of reasons that this case is so interesting not only are there multiple Witnesses 
not only does it have some really unusual effects but it's got humanoids as well and 
it lasted quite a long time this very bizarre case occurred on May 10 1957 and it's quite 
remarkable because it does have six Witnesses it got some pretty good press coverage as well 
and it began when 29 year old Michelle fakit was bicycling home on the Bow Court Road seen here 
and this is just a short little road so it had to be pretty close to this area exactly it was around 10 45 p.m when he says he was quote dazzled by a bright light 
so he was quite alarmed by it this was clearly unusual and he hid behind the telephone pole 
and watched as four small Men He estimates about four to five feet tall approached him in 
of what he says is quote a threatening manner now he says that they were carrying a brilliant light 
which made it very hard to see them other than silhouettes but they clearly were not normal 
people so he ran to the nearest Home it turned out to be the residence of the lapat family 
and they said he was almost incoherent and kept shouting that he had been attacked 
as the witness Michelle said let me in quickly a flying saucer has landed and I was attacked 
so they let him in and they all rushed to the window to see what he was talking about it turned 
out the lights in the house and now they could clearly see a glowing object landed on the ground 
was flashing red yellow and white lights was pretty close no more than 150 feet away and 
they could also see the three men who they said appeared to have oversized dark colored heads all 
the Figures were wearing gray suits sort of like overalls or coveralls and they were moving from 
the road to the field with this strange tottering gate now shortly later another neighbor arrived
and they all watched this for about 20 minutes finally a car approached on the Bow Court Road 
this point the light on the object immediately went out though the witnesses could still easily 
see the figures in the car headlights and they believed that the driver of this car had to have 
seen them too but whether he did or not they don't know the car drove on and as soon as it was gone 
the lights on the object flashed back on but now this object appeared to be floating above the road 
it then Rose quickly and darted off to the Northeast at a 45 degree angle and was gone 
and all the witnesses were very deeply impressed by this sighting as Monsieur lapat says and I 
quote I saw very clearly a luminous ball from which red and yellow Rays escaped 
the craft was moving slowly it was big like that soon after I distinguished the Silhouettes of 
three small men who remained for nearly 20 minutes coming and going in the field and on the road
says his wife I was treating my sick little girl when I heard Mr fidkit who was shouting outside 
come and see I just got attacked I went out and I saw a tremendous light so these are numerous 
Witnesses who are confirming Michelle's story and here's another witness who had a little bit 
of a different story this is Monsieur Shadow Lane and he's actually the mayor of the town 
and he said that they the Witnesses were wrong and that the report was misidentified he says this 
is monsieur chatelaine at that hour our daughter was touring the cattle in the fields at the very 
place where the Martians would have appeared Ella were a big storm lamp to light herself so he's 
saying that they didn't see a UFO or E.T figures and that it was his daughter and later he said 
the Flying Saucer it was my wife so his issuing contradictory statements and it clearly wasn't 
because there were three figures there this was a very large craft it had multiple colored lights it 
went up into the sky it took off at a 45 degree angle so this is clearly a debunking explanation 
and all the other Witnesses are of course convinced they saw something very strange but here's where it gets even weirder the witnesses examined the landing site and they 
found large black plaques they described are patches of quote an elastic nature 
now there's not a lot of information on this and some of it is contradictory because other 
reports state that the material was a 15 foot wide circle of quote asphalt like material 
so whatever this was however large it was it hadn't been there before and all the witnesses 
believed that it was deposited there by the UFO and according to at least one source it 
was in fact identified as asphalt but I don't know because it certainly doesn't sound like 
what the witnesses said they saw which were you know black plaques of an elastic nature 
so there that's not all the physical evidence because this did attract the attention of many 
researchers who tested the area and they found that the iron fence posts along the road where 
this craft was seen were strongly magnetized so again this did get quite a bit of press 
attention and some of the reporters absolutely bought Monsieur Shadow Lane's explanation 
and the police chief also said that he had received several calls from people in the area seeing UFOs but said quote the whole Affair is a collective hallucination well 
I don't agree I mean the witnesses made it very clear that this was a landed UFO with occupants 
there's multiple Witnesses they watched it for 20 minutes there's physical evidence of different 
types I think it's a really interesting case so that's the bow Course Long cray France case 
which is undeniably true with that many witnesses this is clearly not a hoax 
and I really wish we knew what happened to that material and if it truly was asphalt because 
that doesn't make sense and it certainly doesn't match the description of what the witnesses said 
so it's entirely possible I think that there was a cover-up of that physical evidence 
certainly wouldn't be the first time something like that has happened and now we move to another case which is again is just so weird and this one 
occurred in Long Prairie Minnesota and this one I call the alien robots 
this is technically a single witness case at least at first glance but as it turns 
out there were numerous other witnesses to what is apparently the same object but what this gentleman 
describes is I don't think I've heard another case like it is just so weird as we shall see 
so the main witness in this case is a young man 19 years old by the name of James Floyd Townsend 
he sometimes goes by the nickname Jerry but it was around 7 15 p.m on October 23 1965 and James 
was driving West along Highway 27 and he was about four miles east of Long Prairie Minnesota 
and I'll just let James describe what happened because it's so weird as he says 
I went around a bend in the road and my car engine stopped running and my headlights went off 
I looked up and I saw this object sitting in the middle of the road I closer to a stop about 20 feet from it I sat and looked at it for what I would estimate a minute 
so not only did his car and headlight stop His Radio was out at the time that also stopped 
and James estimates that this object was 30 to 40 feet high 10 feet in diameter and 
shaped very much like a conventional rocket and in fact it was or appeared to be resting on fins 
he said it was silver in color and it was blocking a good portion of the road was casting a big 
circle of light brilliant around it on the road very very bright and I will just quote James again 
as he says then I knew what it was and knew that nobody would believe me so I decided that I would 
have to knock it over and have some evidence I tried to start my car but it would not start 
then I got out of my car with the idea to go up to it and try to rock the center of gravity 
and T pull it over so I would have the evidence right there in black and white so he's basically 
thinking about knocking this thing over and as he says I got to the front of my car and stopped with 
no further interest in going any further because three little creatures came from around behind 
and stood in front of the object I think they were looking at me I cannot be sure because I did not 
see any eyes of any sort I know that I was looking at them and I was quite fascinated at what I saw 
so he stopped this point out of caution the little beings he said were very small 
they looked kind of like tin cans or beer cans they were only about six inches tall 
and they had much the same appearance of The Craft itself with little fins on the bottom the 
only difference was they were flat on top and brown in color but they were using these three 
little fins on the bottom to maneuver he says they walked awkwardly in kind of a waddling gate 
and they appeared to have three little arms sticking out like matchsticks 
and James felt that these robotic Little Creatures were aware of him and watching him 
so James continues his testimony as he says I used what I hope was common sense I felt if they could 
stop my car like they did they could surely do something worse to me and I wanted to live to 
tell this story so the people of the United States would know that there were things of this nature 
I stood and looked at them for what seemed to be like ages about three minutes they 
then turned and went under the object and a few seconds later the object started to rise slowly 
now at this point he could hear this object making a high-pitched humming sound and off 
it went straight up he said after it gained a few thousand feet the lights on the object went out 
and he said his car engine started to run the headlights came on as did the radio he did make 
a cursory examination of the landing site but it was dark he didn't see anything and he was really 
frightened at this point so he drove straight to the Todd County Sheriff's Office and made a report 
uh Sheriff Bain took the report and James told Sheriff Bain and Sheriff Payne confirms this James 
said I am not crazy nor am I drunk neither am I ignorant Sheriff Bain said that James appeared 
to be quote excited nervous and shaky so Sheriff the sheriff wanted to return to the site James 
didn't want to do it but he finally agreed so they went to the site and didn't really see anything on 
the ground at this point because their attention was diverted to the object which was still in the 
sky now it looked like a orange light and it was moving about overhead in fact officer Lubitz who 
accompanied them said it was quote flickering off and on and leaving a sort of Yellow Tail so they 
went there the next day in daylight both Sheriff Bain and officer Lou Vern Lubitz and they did 
find some weird evidence they found three parallel strips of a strange oily substance these were four 
inches apart and about three feet long but did not appear to be oil because as Sheriff Payne says I 
don't know what they were but I've looked at a lot of roads and I never saw anything like them before
so this started to get a lot of attention because it turned out there were many other Witnesses in 
the area who had apparently seen the same object at the same time in fact just 15 minutes before 
James saw this object on the road a gentleman by the name of Ray blessing was looking through his 
telescope and watched what was apparently the same object Dart from Horizon to Horizon very quickly 
there were many other Witnesses it turned out there were some Hunters who saw it there were three boys raccoon hunting and they saw it said that they saw a strange light in the 
sky just before James James's sighting so there were many other Witnesses all across this area 
who were reporting sightings and when an article came out about James's encounter more witnesses 
came forward and this created a Snowball Effect and soon there were dozens of Articles being 
published on not only James's sighting but the many other sightings that took place before 
during and after all in this area generally speaking and James got a lot of attention he 
said he received upwards of 300 letters and more than 300 phone calls he said 95 percent 
of them were absolutely positive supporting his testimony or sharing their own sightings 
so needless to say this case did generate a huge amount of interest from many many researchers 
Jim and coral Lorenzen of apro interviewed James they published a report on the case they talked 
to his parents his friends his teachers even the police all of them who vouch for James's 
honesty and integrity in fact James was a very religious man and was a counselor at a Bible 
Camp not the kind of gentleman to lie he was very well respected in his community now this was in 
fact investigated on I'll use quotes around that by Project Blue Book including Jay Allen heineck 
and this object did not appear on any radar that they were aware of and Blue Book basically 
did no investigation according to Jay Allen heineck but listed this case as psychological 
now oddly the report on this case is in fact missing from Blue Book files 
and yeah heinek confirmed they did no official investigation but they did call its parents 
and they warned them to quote keep a lid on the case of course that didn't happen and many other 
researchers in the field looked into this case John Keel looked into it he's a very well-known 
researcher Jacques Vale also found it quite interesting he was investigating UFO Landings 
but many other researchers including Peter Brooke Smith Jerome Clark also looked 
into it he was very interested in the unusual aspects of it but Mark rodiger investigated it 
Bob Gribble of the National UFO Reporting Center Brad Sparks and many others so a final endnote 
to this case is that following this incident James began suffering from strange dizzy spells 
so it also has physiological effects and Landing traces and as James says this is what happened 
I know it is quite a wild story but if you do not believe me well that's your tough luck I wish 
it had never happened but it did and I believe I had an obligation to report it to the authorities 
they and the people have a right to know what is going on I usually meet emergencies without 
losing my head but I have never been this scared before with that case having so many people who 
have researched it and looked into it and so many witnesses I'm honestly surprised it's 
not more well known it's one of the reasons I wanted to include it in this compilation 
because it deserves to be well known it's a very strange case and one of very few involving what 
are clearly some sort of robotic creatures and here is another case that has some very 
unusual features to it I call this one chased by a UFO and this one took place in Norwalk 
Connecticut it involves two witnesses and as we shall see some very unusual elements to it 
and uh also some apparent government involvement so this next case took place on red coat Road in 
Norwalk Connecticut and it was just after 8 A.M on April 8 1966 when two 12 year old 
boys Gary hunt and Mike Dorsey were walking to school they just turned on to Redcoat Road 
when they saw sunlight glinting off an object behind them at this point was pretty far away 
but in an instant they said it zoomed down right towards them very low about 15 feet right over 
their heads traveling from west to east they were heading east it then turned around making a U-turn 
and made a second pass at them again zooming very low over their head in the opposite direction 
and then it stopped pulled another U-turn turned around again and made a third pass buzzing right 
over their heads this is a very unusual behavior they got a pretty good look at it because it was 
so close and it kept coming right at them they said this object was about eight feet in diameter 
four and a half feet high dull silver in color metallic very smooth and it had rotating red and 
white lights around the perimeter and on the top it had an antenna which was flashing a red light 
they said it they said it also made a strange sound kind of like Buzzing Bees only much lower 
no surprise that these two boys panicked as this object is swooping over and over again at them 
so shouting and yelling they ran off Redcoat Road Into the Woods at this time this was not 
developed at all this UFO was still looking for them and in fact as they're leaving the 
road trying to hide in the woods they saw a car with two men drive down Redcoat Road the 
car slowed down the men inside saw the object the two boys could see these other Witnesses 
watching the object they became frightened the men in the car and immediately screeched away 
and I'll just quote one of the witnesses Gary hunt the 12 year old boy as he says when we hid 
behind trees it floated above the trees to spot us when we hid behind rocks it still spotted us 
so they took off running again heading towards the nearby Holy Ghost Seminary 
and in fact four seminaries were outside and spotted these boys being chased 
but they were still unable to elude their pursuer so the boy's hid under a really small Bridge 
and this very persistent UFO now dropped down to about seven feet above the bridge and hovered 
around this bridge circling around it for about five minutes trying to get to the boys apparently 
and at some point about five minutes later the boys heard this weird splashing sound 
they picked out and the UFO was gone so the two boys ran directly home told their parents what happened their parents confirmed 
that the boys were white as a sheet they noted that the time the boys arrived was actually 10 am 
so this meant that the boys had been chased by this object for a period of two hours or 
perhaps and I'll leave this with a question mark had missing time the report is not clear on this 
but later both boys were in school when the principal called them into his office 
and they were surprised to see a man there who was apparently from the government 
and he wanted to question them about their experience he refused to provide his name 
or organization he said only that he was from a classified top secret branch of the government 
and yeah he was very interested in what the boys had seen so clearly any Deni any 
denials from our government saying that they're not interested in this subject is a flat out lie they were very interested in what these boys had to say it's quite a case 
well there are lots of cases of people who've been chased by UFOs I don't know one quite like 
that where it swoops down over and over again right over to Witnesses head and even chases into 
they're under a bridge I mean it's a bizarre case and there's no shortage of high strangeness when 
it comes to UFO encounters as this next case shows this one took place actually in Santa Catarina 
Brazil and I call this one I was shot by an E.T ray gun and this shows what can happen sometimes 
when people take aggressive action towards ETS I think it's got some important insights into the 
nature of the UFO phenomena and again it's just so weird these cases just keep getting weirder 
it was around 7 pm on September 3rd 1976 and again Santa Catarina Brazil 
and a gentleman by the name of Zhao romu Klein he's a 19 year old Farm worker he was walking 
home after visiting a friend's house and he was less than a quarter mile from his home very close 
when he noticed a classic Flying Saucer approaching at very low altitude from the south 
he said it was grain color about nine feet wide the upper section appeared to be rotating and 
on the very top was a bright light and this light was changing in color from red to orange to yellow 
and finally green as the object slowed down so the color of the light appeared to sort of correspond 
with the speed of this object but it absolutely targeted him it made a beeline right towards him 
passing over his head at about a height of 30 feet and then it stopped just ahead of him on 
the path and at this point it was only 15 feet from the ground it then sent down a beam sort 
of a cone-shaped beam of intense red light and in the beam Zhao saw three small beings 
he said they were very short like dwarves each was about three feet high they just floated down in 
the beam of light and stood next to each other all in a row facing him and blocking his path 
meanwhile the craft moved behind Joel and hovered about 24 feet overhead sort of pinning him in 
between the craft and the beings and as Zhao says I was out of my mind with panic and fear as those 
ugly creatures came nearer tears rolled down my cheeks because I suddenly realized that my mother 
would surely believe for the rest of her life that I had abandoned her so he was clearly afraid 
that they were going to take him away forever at this point he's only 900 feet away from his house 
and he really wanted to get home at this point so he started walking towards these 
beings to show him them that he really intended to continue on to his destination but at this point 
the three figures sort of ominously spread their arms out as if forbidding him to pass 
and he says they also began to speak audibly to each other in a very weird strange language 
so this frightened him he said that they looked heavy set and they wore gray coveralls and 
they're also wearing what looked like a sort of a fish bowl type helmet and as Zhao says 
they had globular heads and were strange weapons at their right sides it wasn't until they were 
nearly upon me that I was finally able to move the thought that my mother would be left alone 
always to think I had abandoned her helped me to fight I grabbed the knife I used for stripping 
leaves off sugar cane and I threw it at them but it hit some invisible obstacle and was deflected 
then I crowd cried out in horror as the middle dwarf drew his weapon and pointed it at me 
a bluish light struck my left thigh and my whole body immediately went stiff 
so this weapon looked like a sort of a short Rod like a tiny little flashlight 
and this is really all Zhao remembers when he woke up he was in his house in bed 
he learned that his neighbors had found him lying unconscious on the path 
and upon Awakening Zhao discovered that he was unable to use his left leg at all it was 
completely stiff so he was immediately taken to the azambuja hospital this is in nearby Brusque 
and there he was examined by several doctors and weirdly they could find no sign of injury they did 
conclude that all the muscles in his left leg were totally rigid which made any movement impossible 
so a very strange and bizarre physiological effect and as Zhao says it took three days for 
the stiffness to finally go away I really wonder about that case if you had missing time the fact 
that he was found unconscious on the trail means it's entirely possible he was taken on board and 
doesn't remember but to me the most fascinating aspect of this case is not even the fact that 
the knife that he threw at the ETS was deflected by an invisible force field which is weird enough 
but the fact that his leg was basically paralyzed for almost three days this is a very 
unusual physiological effect and good evidence that something very strange happened for sure 
and now we move to the next case and this one again is so weird I'm not sure what to make 
of it it's really quite a tragic case actually I call this one UFO pre-dix fatal bus accident 
and this one took place in beer Sheba Springs in Tennessee involves quite a few Witnesses I 
couldn't get a whole lot of information on it so it's a pretty brief case but I think it's important to include because it shows some of the weird psychic aspects of UFO encounters
this case occurred on March 17 1978 again in Beersheba Springs Tennessee 
but it was on March 18 one day later in 1978 when a bus carrying 22 members of a fundamentalist 
religious sect left a Mountain Highway in Montego Tennessee and tumbled 100 feet into 
a ravine killing four passengers and seriously injuring the remaining 18 passengers now the 
driver was actually charged with murder for drunk driving and state troopers learned that the truck 
had been rented by the leader of the sect a gentleman by the name of Peter Thomas aged 25 
and he was taking the members of his group on a vacation to Beersheba Springs where 
they were thinking of buying some property and here's where the story gets weird Peter Thomas 
the leader of the sect said that they had rented the 12-foot truck because and I quote we thought 
that would be the most economical and everybody could sleep in the back while we were driving 
but we saw a flying saucer that night all of us did was a big ball of fire that came in over the 
moon came across the sky before it vanished but that's not even the weird part the weird part is 
that Peter Thomas said that that night he had a dream which actually featured this Flying Saucer 
and that it warned him of a terrible accident and he says that in the dream he actually died 
and of course the next day this bus accident did occur killing four members of the sect 
and as Peter says some people blame this on me they say this wouldn't have happened if 
these people hadn't been with me I expect to be shot very soon perhaps within a week 
now there's no word on what happened to Peter it's a very weird case where ETS appeared to be 
warning Peter of this fatal accident which did did in fact occur I think you'll agree that was a very 
weird case and it may sound unique but there are lots of cases where people have had precognition 
that's in conjunction with the UFO encounter in some way so I think that alone really makes 
this case worthy of attention and here's another case which I find super interesting because this 
involves two witnesses who are clearly targeted by a UFO and suffered some very unusual effects 
and in fact I call this one burned by a UFO this one took place in Goya Del coye Italy I think I'm 
pronouncing that right I'm sure someone out there will correct me if I'm wrong but it's absolutely 
an interesting case one of the witnesses is actually quite well known in his country 
it's also took place in a very unusual location as we shall see and involves animal effects as well 
some very significant animal effects so yeah an important case for sure his next case involves two 
young men one of them is parid or Faye at the time he was age 17 he was a Tamer a lion tamer elephant 
Tamer but he later became a very famous singer and also witnessing this event was Felipe Garcia and 
he was an acrobat he was 19 years old and they both were circus performers at the orphe circus 
and in fact parid's father owned the circus they had set up at the Village of Goya Del coye 
and the circus was actually closed on this evening which was March 31st 1980. 
so parade and Felipe decided they were going to go see a movie which they did 
and it was around 1am that they returned to the circus and they were actually standing behind the 
central tent when a UFO showed up parid was the first to see it it was a glowing object and it 
moves directly towards them clearly targeting them and moved so quickly it left a glowing 
Trail of Light and looking up they could see this object or this light sort of a bluish orange orb 
it was about two and a half feet in diameter and an estimate it hovered 
they estimated about 300 feet overhead now for a very long time for about 10 seconds 
and then it turned red as it disappeared and again left a glowing trail behind it as Felipe 
says while we were very frightened the animals were nervous the dogs especially yelped without 
interruptions and the elephants started trumpeting so the animals noticed something strange too 
and at first these Witnesses were afraid to tell anyone what they had seen for fear of ridicule and 
disbelief but that's when they started to notice that they suffered some apparent injuries both 
boys noticed that they had been apparently burned by this object Felipe was wearing a metal watch 
on his wrist and where this watch was his skin was burned so it somehow interacted 
with the medal of his watch and parade was wearing a cowboy belt which had metal studs 
and this was of course around his waist and he had two Burns where the metal was touching his skin 
so realizing that they had burned by a subject they knew they had some evidence and only then did they come forward even then despite their physiological effects 
they were both accused of lying being drunk making up stories that is until 
the witnesses saw that the boys had in fact been burned uh then people started to believe 
them and in fact their story was published in newspapers and got a lot of attention 
it's certainly an interesting case involving two witnesses a UFO which apparently targeted them 
had animal reactions freaking out the circus animals and of course the physiological reactions 
the fact that those two witnesses very nearly kept their encounter a complete Secret 
shows again that the vast majority of encounters are probably not documented in any way it's only 
the fact that they had physiological effects from the result of their encounter that encouraged 
them to report it and they suffered some pretty serious backlash because of it but thankfully 
they did come forward there are many cases like this but a really interesting case with animal 
effects and physiological effects and I think it's an important case that deserves to be well known 
which is why I wanted to include it and there's always another where that one came from because 
here's a case which is really quite bizarre and I call this one the UFO with tentacles 
this took place in kavia Sweden it involves three Witnesses it got a whole lot of attention 
and this one does involve animal effects as well but what's weird to me is the appearance 
of the UFO and how it behaved so I think that alone makes this case worthy of being on this 
list of encounters that are just plain weird kavia Sweden is a pretty small town 
this case occurred in October 27 1981 and it involves three Witnesses who never expected 
to have a terrifying encounter with a UFO when they went out horseback riding on that evening 
the three Witnesses they were all friends and neighbors of each other they include Pia Anderson age 17. Karina sostrom age 14 and Anna Karine lindahl age 11. 
it was around 9pm that evening when they decided to exercise their horses before going to bed 
and I will just let Karina age 14 describe what they saw because she describes it very well 
as she says in her own words it was an unusually bright evening for the time of year 
the horses appeared to be rather uneasy as if there was a presence somewhere around 
now I know the real meaning of Horse Sense usually they like nothing better 
than to be out of the stable they like the jumps best and of course to gallop freely 
but that particular evening they were extremely Restless we decided to take them for a Gallop 
across the heath to get the wind out of them it usually worked it was a wonderful evening 
the stars were just beginning to show but it was still light and suddenly we all stopped 
in our tracks I know it sounds crazy and people have told us it just cannot be true but it is 
we all three of us saw a flying saucer it seemed as if it had arrived from nowhere in particular 
suddenly it was there hovering about eight meters above us it was about as high up as the roof of 
the barn the horses went wild I was nearly thrown off to the dirt but I managed to cling on just as 
suddenly the horses were quiet and docile again it was as if someone had told them there was now 
nothing at all to fear it couldn't have been us for we were scared out of our wits and still were 
I looked up towards the object I almost didn't dare to look up at all I didn't want to believe 
what I had first seen but I can tell you I really saw what I saw I saw with my own two eyes it was 
a shimmering sort of thing about the size of a large car there was scarcely noise coming from it 
although there had been a shrill whining noise when we first encountered it above us 
so that's Karina's testimony but of course both the other girls were equally frightened and 
they all got a very good look at it Pia the oldest she's 17. I'll just let her describe 
what she saw as she says there were lights in a myriad of colors along the edge of The Craft 
it was like the edge of the craft was a rainbow it looked as if it was burning at the center top and bottom although I could see no flames it pulsed red bright red to Pink and a sporadic sort 
of pattern there was nothing regular about the pulses as far as I could see I can swear to it 
now here's where it gets really weird I'll just continue PS testimony as she says 
Omni Underside I was able to see small silver metallic feet protruding they were perhaps a 
half meter each and they were placed around the circumference of the saucer I guess it might have 
been landing gear I can't be sure for they just stuck out and turned slowly with the body of The 
Craft as it seemed to look at us it was weird it had tentacles that were several feet long dangling 
from all around the circumference I felt strange eyes piercing through us I was pins and needles 
all over but it could have been just the Fright of it all it was so unreal it was incredible 
the Flying Saucer just hung there in the air six to eight meters above our heads the horses 
were scared we were scared I wet myself in fear of what could happen to me and my two friends 
I've never been frightened like that before we were alone I didn't know what to do I was 
paralyzed with fright otherwise I might have run for my life and hung there in the air over us for 
more than six minutes so that's a pretty long time at some point the object disappeared or moved away 
when it was gone Pia looked at her watch and noticed it had stopped dead it hasn't worked since 
she even took it to get repaired but the repairman couldn't find anything wrong with it and can't 
explain why it doesn't work so needless to say the girls galloped home in Terror at top speed 
so fast that their writing instructor Miss Anita so strong saw them running full tilts for the barn 
and she was initially furious at them because the horses I mean it's dangerous to gallop that fast 
and as she says I ran out to give them a ticking off about the way they had treated 
the horses I've always tried to tell the girls to take it easy with the horses but this time 
they had ridden them home as though all hell had broken loose and apparently it had for the 
girls were lying in the hay crying their little eyes out when I opened the door to the stable 
took me almost an hour to get them coherent enough to tell me what had happened at first 
I thought they might have run into a dirty old man or perhaps worse but I was certainly not prepared 
for what they had to tell me about a flying saucer I mean it was all so incredible I would 
have needed to see it with my own eyes I don't doubt for a moment the girls told me the truth 
it's just that it sounds so weird and wonderful strange but still fascinating and I didn't believe 
in flying saucers before either but I don't doubt the girls for a minute they're telling the truth
so it was only one day after the incident that reporters showed up reporter Alf Olson 
interviewed the girls and came away convinced as he says they're just ordinary school girls 
account for the life of me imagine than putting on such an intricate and incredible story 
just for the effect it might cause them their friends in fact they were rather reticent at first 
about speaking of it at all to a newspaper man for they thought the readers might laugh at them 
if the story was used in the paper of course it was used there there was a lot of people 
wanting to interview them and finally Pia Anderson said this is the last time I'm going to speak to 
anyone about it I know I saw it but people think I've just got to be crazy that I'm hallucinating 
so researchers did do some investigating they contacted the local airport we've 
said that their radar equipment showed no air traffic they contacted other airports they even 
contacted the Swedish defense department who expressed an interest in the case 
considered their Air Force's special investigation group in link open would look into the case 
I don't know if ever if that ever happened uh but that's as far as the case goes and it's certainly 
a very weird case so there you go clearly not imagination if the horses are reacting as well 
three Witnesses saw this and in fact some of them were so traumatized by it that they don't 
want to talk about it as we've seen ever again a really remarkable case but this last case that 
I'd like to present to you today is to me by far the weirdest and just so strange this one 
took place in Russia actually in Arc Arch let me see if I can get this right Arc anglesque Russia 
so what's really interesting about this case it does involve two truck drivers and multiple 
Witnesses beyond that but one of these truck drivers actually went on board the UFO I call this 
case they looked like bags and when I say they that's the ETS this is a very unusually described 
type of extraterrestrial but it goes so so far beyond that I mean there are some weird aspects 
to this case that I have never heard before and I think it really should be more well known 
you may have heard of it this was covered in the eyes on Cinema website but I found some quite a 
few new details on this case which really deserve to be known because while are they 
weird this next case occurred on November 2nd 1989 and the two main Witnesses again 
are professional truck drivers their names are Oleg kurzikov and Nikolai beranchikov 
they were driving their truck from archangelesque to Moscow late at night 
now this is a long Highway as you can see through mostly wilderness and they reached a point of the 
highway that was actually closed for construction so they had to take a little detour along a dirt 
road running parallel to the highway and that's when they came upon an apparent UFO 
and I'll just quote Oleg directly as he says I thought it was some kind of construction equipment 
there are many machines there because the road was under construction however when I drove closer I saw a big object that in the headlights had a metallic Sheen to it 
when we got within 80 to 90 feet of the object our motor stalled and our truck coasted several feet 
further I and my partner couldn't understand what had happened we understood that we were seeing 
something very unusual in front of us and were afraid that something unavoidable would happen 
now their headlights were still operating they were connected to a different system an Oleg who was driving told Nikolai to wait in the truck while he got out to investigate 
and boy does it get weird as Olex says I approached the object I left the cab and 
decided to approach the object to examine it more closely after I had passed the hood of the truck I began to feel with each step I took and increased resistance from the air 
my body seemed to melt became difficult to move and I knew that if I got any closer to the object 
I would not be able to move at all so he backed up he tried to approach the object from a different 
angle but he still felt the same weird force field this resistance and he got as close as he 
could he was able to approach to about 30 feet from the object but any closer was impossible 
you got a very good look at it he said this object was disc shaped quite large about 130 
feet in diameter clearly metallic and a dome on top and what he first thought might be dark 
portholes around the perimeter this object had come down right alongside the road and actually 
landed on some birch trees snapping them right off there were no lights on the object at all 
and what he felt were portholes were very dark in fact there was no signs of any activity whatsoever 
but then it got even weirder suddenly this very bizarre transparent screen this is about 
six inches square and had a glimmering red dotted lines around the edges the screen appeared three 
feet in front of him right at eye level and inside this sort of floating glowing screen 
Oleg saw red words glowing red words appear on the screen and they read in Russian burning fire 
or words to that effect and as Oleg turned look back at Nikolai this screen actually followed his 
line of vision attract his eye sight and always stayed right in front of wherever he was looking 
so Oleg decided that the screen was giving him instructions to start a fire 
so he walks back to the truck to fetch some matches and some alcohol which they use for 
antifreeze and he's trying to open nikolai's front passenger door but he couldn't open it 
not even with nikolai's help they were fussing around with it until suddenly for no apparent 
reason that they could see it opened very easily so he got the matches and the alcohol he returned 
right up to the craft and this time he felt no resistance at all so he approached right up next 
to it he gathered a few dry leaves doused them with alcohol took a match out and lit a small fire 
and looking up at the craft he saw an opening in the side of the craft which was leading to 
a corridor inside and you could see this bluish light coming out from this opening 
and I'll just quote Oleg again as he says first I had the impression that a shadow was moving inside 
the corridor but then I realized that something was moving in the corridor towards the opening 
when I finally realized what was happening I began stepping backwards and fell into a ditch 
along the road I jumped back onto my feet and continued to observe what was happening 
something approached the opening and I saw that it was a dark Mass which reminded me of a bag or sack 
as the mass moved its swayed and bent from side to side and its periphery was vague in appearance 
at this moment a shaft extended from the object it bent and it descended to the surface of the ground 
the mass slid down the shaft while increasing in size and approached the fire of burning leaves 
I was paralyzed by fear the mass stood by the fire for a moment and then began to return to the 
object taking with it the box of matches returning along the same path along which it left the object 
the mass disappeared in the corridor together with the box of matches only then did I finally succeed 
in extracting myself from the ditch I returned to the road I glanced back at my truck again 
the truck's headlights Blinded Me But nevertheless I could see the frightened face of Nikolai which 
was pressed forward tightly against the windshield so yeah this is very weird these 
blurry bag like beings there's this little shaft it's like a pole which came down from the opening 
and this weird resistance which prevented him from approaching the craft 
so Oleg looks back at the craft and this point he became very curious to see what was inside 
and he apparently got an invitation because as Oleg says in his own words and I quote 
I had a desire to look inside but since the door was above my head I decided to grab hold of the 
tube and jump the instance I grabbed the tube I found myself standing just inside the opening 
there was nothing there in the form of either steps or elevator I did not feel any kind of 
external influence but rather everything seemed to happen naturally or by itself 
I thought of the possibility of danger to me and decided to be as careful as possible but that 
instant I received a message on the screen that I had nothing to be afraid of and that I could enter 
upon entering the corridor I looked at the walls and noticed the absence of doors the corridor was 
significantly wider than the opening floor was flat and the walls and ceiling formed an oval 
and which along the corridor toward the shimmering light and I felt that I was walking on a flat 
metallic floor somehow I got the feeling that the surrounding walls did not have simply a decorative 
covering but rather they were structural and something was connected to them from the back side 
there clearly was some sort of strengthening device attached to them I did not want to 
touch the walls so I'm unable to say what it was that served to strengthen the walls 
so again inside the floor is flat the walls and ceilings were carved we walked about 25 
feet down this wide Corridor into a round room which he says was totally white it was about 50 
feet wide it had a domed ceiling and there was a bright blue light shining from above and he could 
see five other doorways just like the one he had come out of along the walls he saw weird panels 
with flashing lights also in the room were two of these dark bag like figures he had seen and 
they began to move towards him and again I'll just quote Oleg as he says as soon as I looked around 
the hall certain questions came to me answers to which appeared immediately on the screen 
but then I noticed that the answers appeared in my head before I was able to read them on the screen 
several answers were accompanied by demonstrations of the operation of those structures that 
interested me such a manner my question of the significance of the dark horizontal recess in 
the wall off to my left was demonstrated to me this recess was a three-dimensional information 
screen on which I was shown the interior of another sister ship with the same moving masses 
during the demonstration the two masses in our ship were Motionless then they showed a ship 
in space Among the Stars and at the end of the demonstration they showed the speaker of a Soviet 
television program called remya so this is beyond weird I'll just continue Olex testimony as he says 
off to my right side there was an oval control panel or desk located about five feet from the 
wall on which there were many switches and lamps all of the lamps had a flat square shape and from 
all appearances they appeared to be pressable some of them were elevated above the level of 
the control panel and others were flush with the top of the panel on the upper surface of 
the lamps there were some symbols in the form of geometric figures circles triangles quadrilateral 
figures lines Etc and combinations of the above the black switches on the panel were similar in 
appearance to toggle switches so when he says lamps he sink he means sort of glowing buttons 
and they all have these weird symbols on them as you can see here so Oleg asked more questions he 
asked him who are you and where are you from they didn't answer him verbally and instead 
at this point the Dome above him dimmed and showed a star map which pulsated and descended 
and one of the stars on the map started blinking and Oleg ask them where that star was 
because that was clearly what they were saying that this was where they're from and the beings told him this is in your Galaxy and so I'd just like to quote Oleg one more time 
because this is such an interesting description that he gives as he says I asked question after 
question the answers I received were heard in my head before I saw them on the screen 
I asked what kind of ship am I on now what kind of propulsion system do you use to make it fly 
in response I was told the spacecraft is a scout ship and uses electromagnetic fields to fly 
I was also told that they are studying our planet which they need as a springboard to the Future in 
response to my question do you have any connection with Bigfoot they said yes and added that they 
watch Bigfoot continuously as I was asking question after question I suddenly noticed that 
a third Mass had appeared in the hall and then a fourth I watched a conversation take place between 
them and came to the understanding that the time for me to leave had arrived my next thought was to 
leave something with them for a memory so I took off my watch and I wanted to put it on the floor 
but at this moment I was told that they have a complete knowledge of the earth and needed nothing 
for the first time during this visit they asked me why do I use a watch made in another country 
then I asked is it possible to see you once again they said if you will be in danger we will find 
you within 15 seconds so backing out a few steps from the hall I turned and went along the corridor 
towards the opening and as I came to the opening of the spacecraft I took a hold of the tube by 
my right hand and I immediately found myself standing on the ground not looking back I went 
to the ditch and crossed over to the road to the same place where I had stood a few minutes before 
when I looked back I noticed that the tube and the opening had disappeared in a few seconds I saw the outer rim begin to move in a clockwise Direction the Dome began to move 
in approximately 30 seconds in a counterclockwise Direction and around it began to appear a 
luminescence surrounding the spacecraft as the revolutions became faster the luminescence 
enveloped the spacecraft and the craft became a ball of light so it took about 30 seconds until it 
turned to a ball of light and it was starting to rise up and it was at this point that other cars 
drove up on the highway and also saw this UFO as it lifted up and shot out of sight at high speed 
so Nikolai at this point exited the truck and ran up to him as if the people inside 
the other cars they began to question Oleg but he was too shaken up to speak 
and when he returned to the truck he found he was not able to drive and had to let Nikolai Drive 
but here's another very interesting detail as Oleg says Nikolai told me that when I came out 
of the craft there there was a glow around me he said I was shining like the Lord God 
there was some sort of halo around my body and it was as if my body was transparent 
so yeah what a story it's a really incredible encounter and it's actually not over yet 
because later Oleg believes his life was saved by Supernatural means so we always regretted not 
asking them for a souvenir but he doesn't think they would have given him anything but he was very 
interested and intrigued in the fact that they said that they would rescue him if ever he was in danger and it was some years after the incident that he was out hunting crossing the river zua on 
skis and suddenly he fell through the ice into the river and he wanted to toss his rifle aside 
but the clear thought came to his head that he shouldn't do that that it would come in handy and it did he was able to use it to climb back onto the ice and what's really 
interesting is he saw this little old woman running towards him accompanied by a little 
black dog and she pulled him out of the water and then literally he says dissolved before my eyes 
so he went to the nearest Village and asked about this little old woman and no one knew who she was 
so that itself was very strange so there you go 10 cases of high strangeness all of them weird 
I think you will agree coming from all over the world spanning decades lots of witnesses 
I'm surprised there are still Skeptics in this world because these cases alone I think should be enough to convince anybody they have outstanding physiological evidence 
they also have Landing traces there are animal effects I mean what more do you need how much 
evidence is it going to take before this subject is taken more seriously I think we are seeing 
great progress with the recent Congressional hearings but we're still not at that point there 
is still skepticism there is still ridicule there still is a UFO cover-up that's why I do 
this research I think this is an important subject every case deserves our attention 
and there are so many of them so I want to thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate 
it I hope you learned something hope you found it entertaining and once again until next time keep 
searching for answers keep looking for the truth and of course keep having fun until next time bye
