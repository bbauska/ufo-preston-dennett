THE HUMANOIDS: TWELVE TRUE CASES OF FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT WITH HUMANOIDS
Dec 8, 2023

Summary:
Dec 8, 2023
Each UFO encounter has something new to teach us about the UFO phenomenon, and this is especially true with cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. The twelve cases presented here span many decades and come from across the planet, and yet they show both remarkable commonalities and intriguing unique aspects. So many independent witnesses, so many different kinds of extraterrestrials, so much evidence! And most importantly, so many cases! The truth can no longer be denied!

THE ETS ON THE PLATFORM. On Jul 25, 1938, during a civil war in Guadalajara, Spain, two military officers observed a disc-shaped object descend nearby. To their shock, a platform with two humanoids extended from the craft. Not knowing about UFOs, the men first thought it was a secret Russian military craft. Before long, they would change their minds.

THE CROUCHING ALIEN. It was quitting time on Sep 5, 1954, as 12-year-old John Jacob Swaim finished plowing the wheat-field of his family farm in Coldwater, Kansas. Then he saw a tiny little man staring at him. He ran after the man, who floated to a craft landed nearby. The craft quickly darted away. Afterward, hundreds of tiny footprints were found in the field.

THE PEACEFUL ET. In Jun of 1967, Franjo Friedl was trimming trees in his backyard in Croatia and saw what he first thought was a uniformed soldier. Then the figure approached and Franjo saw that it was a strange 4-foot-tall humanoid. The ET said he wanted to make  contact with Franjo,  and told him to tell no one. The ET ran into a saucer, which flew away.

THREE LITTLE SPACEMEN. One evening in Oct 1967, Donald Marshall was walking to his home in Melford, Saskatchewan, Canada. Behind his home, he saw a strange light, and then saw it was actually a window attached to a craft landed. That’s when he saw three little humanoids running around. They ran into the craft, which took off, breaking off tree branches as it left.

“HEY YOU…ALIENS!” On the night of Apr 26, 1969, David Arychuk took his dog Brandy for a walk by his home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Brandy stopped and look up at a strange craft floating about 20 feet high. David then saw two humanoids standing near the craft. His dog panicked and begged to go home. Upon returning shortly later, the craft was gone.

THE WILLARD UFO WAVE. On the night of Jan 22, 1971, the phones at the police station near Willard, Ohio rang off the hook with callers reporting UFOs. Among the dozens of witnesses was a couple who said the UFO hovered 100 feet over their car. Inside, through a transparent dome, they saw a strange humanoid.

ENCOUNTER CAUSES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.  Around 4:30 am on Sep 9, 1972, a man observed a low-flying craft near his home in Glasgow, Scotland. Looking down at him from a porthole of the craft, he saw a blond-haired humanoid wearing a silver suit. The man was so traumatized that following the encounter, he suffered a nervous breakdown.

THE TALL SILVER MAN. It was early afternoon on Jul 10, 1975 as the Taylors drove near Ewloe, Clwyd in Wales. To their shock, they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid wearing a full-body silver jumpsuit picking up things alongside the road. At first they kept their encounter secret. But then other people began to report seeing the same strange being.

EXTRATERRESTRIALS ON MOUNT EVEREST. In 1933, Frank Smythe was climbing Everest when he saw two UFOs hovering overhead. Later, other climbers saw UFOs, including Reinhold Messner and Doug Scott. Jan Scott (Doug’s wife) was at basecamp and said everyone there saw the UFOs. One time, a UFO came so low, she saw figures through a window.

THE INJURED HUMANOID. On the night of Jun 12, 1977, David X stepped outside a hotel in Crystal Lake, Illinois and saw three 4-foot-tall humanoids approach. He first thought they were coming for him. Then he saw another humanoid lying on the ground only a few feet in front of him. That’s when he realized that the ETs were there to rescue their fallen comrade.

ROBOTIC ALIEN AT ATOMIC INSTALLATION. On the night of Mar 18, 1978, Ken Edwards was driving by an atomic installation by his home in Risley, England. He then saw a silver-suited figure with outstretched arms walk into the middle of the road. Ken was struck by a beam of light, which fried his radio. The figure walked through a fence and disappeared. Soon events became even more bizarre.

REPTILIANS OVER ELECTRIC STATION. In the Fall of 1990, a couple drove by an electric power station and saw a strange teardrop-shaped UFO cross the road ahead of them and hover over the station. To their shock, they saw two reptilian humanoids looking down at them through an open-air platform. One of them heard a mental message, “Do not stay here. Go away!”

These 12 humanoid encounters show how bizarre UFO encounters can be, and that we still have much to learn about ET contact and the ET agenda on our planet. Yet they make it very clear that we are not alone, and that we have been visited for a very long time.

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today I'd like to talk about one of my favorite aspects of euphology and that of course is humanoids and that's the title of this
episode The humanoids 12 cases of face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials I love these cases because as I've said many times there's very little chance of misperception because these encounters are so close I also like them because they really have the potential to answer a lot of the questions surrounding UFO contact what it's like to have contact with the ETS why the ETS are here the different types of ETS and so
forth so these cases come from all over the world across Europe Canada the
United States and reach back through time all the way to the 1930s up to the
1990s and what I like about these cases is they're all different each involving
different types of humanoids there's a huge variety of humanoids it's super
fascinating and we definitely see that in this collection of cases some are
quite brief so I was able to squeeze in 12 cases but some are pretty extensive
and all I think are super interesting and they do of course contain evidence of the kinds we often
see which is animal reactions some interesting Landing traces medical
effects electromagnetic disturbances as well so with 12 cases that's a lot to
cover let's just get started in the first case I'd like to talk about I call
the ETS on the platform and this took place on July 25
1938 in guadalahara Spain this is an interesting case not
only because it's very early in time but it's quite an unusual shape of a UFO
what it did is very unusual and it also took place at a time when the country
was being torn by a civil war so that itself
is pretty interesting again at the time of this encounter Spain was in the middle of a bad Civil War but it was
around 11:15 p.m. on July 25 19 38 when
a lieutenant and his Aid were descending down a gully in the town of La
alaria again this is in guadalahara Spain suddenly a brilliant white light
Shone down from above it went out moments later but looking at the source
of the light the two witnesses saw a dis shaped object which they estimated was
about 33 ft wide and 15 ft tall all was pretty close about 180 ft away from them
and it hovered only 6 ft above the ground they said it looked like quote
two plates joined on their convex sides separated by a line or section of a
darker color now as they watched a column with
a small platform extended down from the lower section and on the platform were
two humanoid figures now after this column carrying the figures came down the object Shone down
a blue light on the ground and when the light hit the witnesses they said that
they could feel this strange sensation of coldness the disc itself seemed to be
surrounded by colored Sparks after a few moments the light Switched Off the
platform in the column retracted back into the craft then the two halves of
The Craft appear appeared to rotate in opposite directions and at the same time the disc glowed with a white light and
shot upwards into the sky and was gone at the time the witnesses did not
think that this was a UFO or extraterrestrial craft they assumed it was a secret Russian military craft
which it may have been I don't know uh but later on they did believe that this was probably
extraterrestrial or a classic UFO it's interesting to me that in that case the
witnesses did not even really consider the possibility that this was extraterrestrial of course not until
much later but it certainly looks like that was an extraterrestrial craft and
perhaps investigating why humans were being so violent to each other that's pure
speculation of course I don't know but given that this is a warning that so many contacts get I think it's a
definite possibility but let's move on to the next case and I love this one it's very poignant
involving a very young witness who had a face-to-face encounter with a really
unusual humanoid and I call this one the crouching alien this took place on
September 2nd 1954 on a farm in Coldwater Kansas and I
love this case because the main witness got a very close up look at this ET it
also involv some really compelling evidence in terms of Landing traces as well the sun was setting and was about
quitting time early in the evening of September 2nd 1954 as 12-year-old John Jacob Swain
finished plowing the Farm's wheat field with the family's tractor now this field was terrist this
is an important detail and John was just getting ready to go into the house when
he saw something un usual peeking over the ridge of one of The Terraces so he went closer to go see and
whatever it was moved behind another Terrace so John crept closer and then
got a huge shock as he saw a 3ot tall little man crouching down and looking
right at him John said that this little guy had dark skin as he says quote pretty dark
complexioned and he was dressed in a jumpsuit which John said was quote sort of
shiny and on his back he had two foot long shiny cylinders kind of strapped to
his back and according to John it looked like he had little flippers for shoes on
his feet and as John says describing what happened I was on the tractor discing
suddenly I saw him about 20 ft away he stood right there a little fellow about
the size of a 5-year-old child he had long pointed ears and a pointed nose he was sort of crouching looking at
me then he ran or maybe he flew to the saucer I hadn't seen the saucer until
then it was hanging about 5 ft from the ground the little man jumped in a door
and the saucer took off it went awfully fast so fast that compared to it a jet
would seem like a turtle now John did get a look at them the this little guy's face and said he
kind of looked as he said mean and he said its hands quote looked just like
anyone's hands only smaller now according to John this ship was shaped somewhat like a cucumber said
it was about 50 ft long and had seven lights or perhaps lit Port holes on it
and it was about 300 ft away from where John had first seen this little
fellow now later he spoke with the Reverend uh Reverend
baller and John provided more details about what he saw as John wrote to the
Reverend I came on a Terrace he was crouched behind it he jumped up and
looked at me and kind of floated he jumped into the saucer and it took off it went out of
sight so immediately after this encounter JN ran and told his parents
who could tell pretty quickly by John's excitement that he was telling the truth
so they called the local sheriff sheriff Floyd Hadley who came to investigate and
John told the sheriff everything he saw and then said that after he saw the little man he quote went home I never
knew a fellow could get over those Terraces so fast so they went out to investigate in
the field and this is when Sheriff Hadley found lots of small Footprints
and he said a few of them were perfectly defined and as Sheriff Hadley says in his own words there were 100 of them
around in a circle where John Jacob said the little man climbed aboard the saucer
there were four tracks where the boy first saw the little man but none between the two sets of prints which
were about 30 yards apart so This lends Credence to John's
testimony that this little man actually floated or flew and the sheriff says he actually
wrote a confidential letter to the FBI in Washington along with impressions of
these Footprints unfortunately nothing is known about what happened to this
evidence but John's father also talked to the sheriff of course and to
reporters and John's father says John Jacob has never been a boy to tell any
Tall Tales he convinced me he had seen something so John's father of course
examined the footprints as well and as he says they were pearshaped about 4 and
1/2 in Long a little less than 2 in across at the toes and with the
narrowest heels I ever saw the prins weren't those of any animal I know all
the wild Prince the impression was deepest at the toes as if the fellow had been running
but there wasn't any great weight behind the prince they didn't show a hard impression more like they had been made
by a soft shoe the boy saw something now Robert's younger
10-year-old brother backed up his older brother and said quote I know one thing
my brother saw what he saw though he did tell the reporters that he was kind of mad he didn't get to
see the little man too and said that his big brother quote has all the
luck so John Jacob stuck to his story and he he says quote I swear I saw him
it's a pretty interesting case what an amazing case that is yes it does have
only one witness but the family certainly backs him up and as well there
are all those Footprints and Landing traces that were found and it's certainly an unusual case given the
description of the ET and here's another case which is equally fascinating I call this one the
peaceful ET and this is a very interesting case involving a unusual
humanoid a very close interaction with the humanoid this case occurred on in
June of 1967 in bovar Croatia what we now call
Yugoslavia and this is first encounter is the most interesting but I believe it
led to several contacts and in fact the witness ended up writing a whole book
about his experiences so it's quite an extensive case the witness in this case is a
professor professor Franjo friedell and it all began when he decided to trim the
popular trees in his backyard which were overgrown and he was doing this over a
period of days trimming them then early when one morning he went out to trim
them and stepped out into the woods behind his house and this is when he saw a figure wearing a green gray suit and a
helmet and he first thought this must be a soldier as there was an Army base
somewhat nearby he had seen soldiers in the woods before so he just continued
cutting brush and this is when he saw this same figure approaching him and now
he could see it was quite unusual was wearing a very unusual uniform it was
very short about 4T tall he said it had broad shoulders and
looked strong but did have a huge chest with kind of a womanly figure he said
but this figure wore a dirty green uniform that to him looked a little bit
like leather he said it had a round Contraption on its chest with a tube
which connected to the helmet on its head there was another similar Contraption on its back which had three
tubes also connected to the helmet and this helmet covered the entire head much
like an astronaut but did have a visor a face plate another thing Franjo noticed was
that these round Contraptions strapped to the being's torso seemed to Shimmer
with a kind of iridescent color so as this figure approached he
was still thinking at first that it was a soldier but then it spoke a strange word which he said sounded like
hoek he heard a loud male voice and at this point Franjo says he felt an almost
electric current sweep through him as he realized that this figure was not human
and was probably an ET and he said the ET spoke in a male
sing song voice peace be with you do not be afraid and walked right up to him
stood in front of Franjo and then said three words which were in a foreign
language which sounded something like aiome which frano somehow understood to
mean quote time is short now frro was quite shocked at all
this he was unable to respond he says as this being stood next to him he felt
strangely isolated in his surroundings everything was quiet it was just like he
and this figure and the world faded away this figure was only 6 feet away from him and he said it spoke again it said
said I came to tell you that everything is all right with you if you agree I
want to continue to contact you now when this happened Franjo said he felt a
strange pressure in his head but he did nod an affirmation and the ET replied
keep the secret I will be back and then repeated that strange word again
hoek the creature then walked into the woods Franjo stood there stunned as he
saw this mirrorlike silver disc rising from the bushes just a short distance
away this was clearly a craft it had a series of round Port holes on the bottom
section you could see what looked like a hole in the bottom center it was totally silent but he watched as it rotated
lifted up and took off emitting a strong gust of wind and what looked like a sort
of bluish Flame or exhaust he said it made no sound again began as it suddenly
accelerated away gaining altitude and moving off into the distance so Franjo was so stunned by
this he just sat down where he stood and it was at this point he heard a voice
say telepathically in his head we are in a safe place now and you shall be at
peace so that was his first encounter but apparently they continued cuz Franjo
ended up writing a book about his encounters called Lam Arabi in fact a library in Croatia has
his books and they have a little quote about him they say Franjo quote claimed
to have had encounters with extraterrestrials he called jeie and to
have spoken with them he published articles about it in the magazines vikend Arena and ARA in the manuscript
he left his books discovery of biblical Secrets Genesis of religions and Genie
and Cosmos according to Genie and of course Lam Arabi which has two volumes
and apparently this library is still in possession of Fran Jo's Books I haven't
read Franjo friedel's book that he wrote about his experiences unfortunately it is in
another language that I cannot understand but I sure would be interested to find out what he had to
say about his contacts Beyond this initial encounter that he had with this
very unusual ET what a fascinating case and here's
another one that I find equally interesting it's quite brief yes but has
some really interesting elements to it I call this one three little Spacemen this
occurred in October 1967 in a little town called Melfort
this is in Scot Chuan Canada and it's quite a compelling case it was around
9900 p.m. one evening in October 1967 as Donald Marshall walked home after
visiting his cousin again this is in melord into Scot youan and as he
approached his home he noticed an unusual light behind his house and getting closer he could see
that the origin of this light was coming from a squarish window
attached to an object of some kind that had apparently landed in his backyard and looking at it he could see
that this window was quite big about 16 ft long he estimates 4T high and it
appeared to be about 12 ft off the ground and as he got closer he could see
it was in fact attached to this craft of some kind which was much bigger he
estimates about 50 ft long and he walked up to it to a about 200 ft away he heard
no sound but as he got close he says a bright Spotlight came on and this is
when he saw three little quote Spacemen coming out of this craft he said they
each wore green uniforms and some kind of green headgear they appeared to be
about the size of a 10-year-old child he says they moved very quickly no sooner
had he seen them when they disappeared he's not sure where they went but as
soon as they were out of view this craft took off first lifting up and moving off
very slowly apparently hitting some trees and then hovering over a gully
before moving off uh he estimates the total duration of this encounter was about 18 maybe 19
minutes which is a quite long encounter and he was still afraid that
these little humanoids might be around so he didn't really investigate just went into the house and waited until the
next morning to go outside and see if he could find any evidence and the only
evidence he could see were some broken branches off the tree in the area but he
remains absolutely convinced he saw a landed UFO and three little
Spacemen and interestingly it was about 11 months later in September when a
family in the same town heard a high-pitched sound over their Farmhouse they later learned the next
morning from their neighbor that he saw an object hovering over their house they didn't see it they became scared when
this weird sound increased in pitch and the temperature Rose so quickly in their
house that they retreated into the cellar so they later learned that another neighbor actually saw three
disc-shaped objects in their area so this is somewhat confirmation for Donald
Marshall's encounter and certainly shows that something is going on in the area of melord in Saskatchewan
Canada while that is a single witness case apparently there were other Encounters in that area at that time
which always brings up a level of corroboration and increases the
credibility of a case I think and there's always another case that's what's so amazing about this subject is
it's far more common than people realize I've said it many times but it Bears
repeating most people don't report their encounters so any estimates as to how
common this is it's probably not accurate and here's another case very
brief also from Canada I call this one hey you aliens this is a pretty interesting case
which took place on April 26th 1969 in Alberta
Canada and again quite brief but I think worth knowing about it was a cool dark
evening on April 26 1969 in Calgary as David aruk was taking his dog Brandy for
a walk near his home and he was about halfway down the block when his dog
Brandy suddenly stopped in her tracks and looking up about 600 ft away
he and of course his dog observed a circular craft with three pulsating red
lights on top he said it was about 20 ft high 30 ft in diameter it was sort of a
cream color but looked like it had a sort of pitted surface and he could smell this strange odor which was he
described as both sweet and bitter but it was very strong strong enough that
David became a bit nauseous he said and looking at this object he saw that
between him and the object about 300 ft from him were two tall figures wearing
dark clothing as soon as he saw them he saw that they were approaching the craft
and they were beginning to walk around the farther end now at this point he thought that they were perhaps his
friends and he shouted out hey you these figures did not respond and he couldn't
get any closer because his dog Brandy refused to approach so David took his
dog Brandy who was now shivering with fear took her back home and he returned
to the area with his stepdad unfortunately by then the craft and the beings were gone but he did say that
this strange odor still hung heavily in the air and when they returned the next
day they could still smell this strange odor I think that case is important
because it illustrates how strong animal reactions can be that poor dog Brandy
certainly had a strong reaction to this encounter they also find it interesting that this case involved very strong
odors which lingered for a full day that's unusual but certainly not unique
and it's something important to say about this phenomena I did a prior episode on UFO odors so I think that's
an important aspect to UFO encounters that certainly deserves more attention and here's another Super
interesting case this actually involves a number of encounters it's quite a complex case I call this one the Willard
UFO wave this took place in Willard Ohio mostly on January 2nd 22nd
1971 it involves dozens of witnesses uh one family a couple who had
a very close encounter with this UFO and were able to see the humanoids inside it
so I think you'll find this quite interesting starting around 9900 p.m. on the evening of January 22nd
1971 the phones at the Norwalk sheriff's office in hin County Ohio began to ring
off the hook Captain John L Warner and Deputy Hank tapel fielded a swarm of
calls from people reporting UFOs and in fact two police officers Sergeant Jim
Robertson and patrolman Harvey kellahan were on patrol in different parts of the
county when they both reported seeing a low flying craft of some kind Harvey
Callahan was actually filling out an accident report When the UFO rep
appeared and he said it looked quote like something strange flying very low
with flashing lights uh it moved off both officers who
saw this craft said it was actually being chased by military jet aircraft and people all over the area
were calling in to say that they saw it some of the witnesses include Dorothy
goel who watched it with a dozen of her friends and she said it was quote Square
shaped like a big box had red and yellow FL flashing lights at both end was about
200 to 300 ft above us and seemed to Circle and then went away it either flew
away or turned the lights out she said it looked like quote a crazy flying
school bus in the sky so people gave different descriptions I think based on
their perspective John Nester was with Dorothy and he said it could not have been a
plane it was the wrong shape and moved mov too slowly some of the witnesses
said that they were so frightened by the appearance of this object they actually refused to look at it but the most
amazing account comes from Richard Williams age 18 and his wife Sharon who
were driving with their infant s along nver road towards the town of Willard
and suddenly they saw this low flying object coming directly towards their car
and I'll just quote Richard directly as he says in his own words I saw the object approaching me it
looked like a bat the wings were wider than the plane or whatever it was on the
middle of each Wing there seemed to be an exhaust rocket engine or a jet engine
it had red and white lights on each of the Wings and on the tail I saw one light on each side of the
wingspan after blinking my lights at it it stopped and hovered down a little
closer I could just about see the outline as my lights were on bright it
looked like an airplane except it was really huge it was really huge it was bigger than any army
hovercraft now to his shock this object stopped directly over his car no higher
than 100 ft he says and now he could see that it made no noise whatsoever and he
could clearly see it wasn't any plane more experimental aircraft as he thought
and in fact he said it was diamond shaped about 30 ft in diameter and in
the center he could see what looked like a glass Dome and in this Dome he could
see the movement of quote some kind of creature he couldn't really see any
details all he could see was a silhouette but as Richard says and I
quote in the back of the cockpit there was something flashing the light on and off off like you were blocking the
light so this craft whatever it was hovered there for about 4 to five
minutes and then moved off and it was shortly later according to Richard jet
fighters appeared and followed the path that the UFO had taken Richard called
the police he later spoke with reporters and he says he even submitted a two-page
report to an aerospace office in Washington DC saying that he had never
seen anything like this before so the hon County police station
said that by the night's end they had received more than 18 separate calls on
that night after an article came out in the newspaper a bunch more people called
in reporters and investigators converged they contacted local airports they
contacted Wright Patterson Air Force Base all who denied having any information information about any
aircraft in the area and in fact rright Patterson Air Force Base denied that any
Jets had been in this area that they these Jets were not
theirs now the sheriff Captain John Warner who handled a bunch of these
calls talked with Richard Williams and he said of Richard's call the man who
saw it on nver road and his family are pretty upset what it was I don't know
for sure when you get a call like that you think oh it's a drunk or a crack
poot but when so many people call and a deputy and a highway patrol man see it
too you wonder the man who first called Willard police was really shook he must
have seen something that's definitely the kind of case that makes me wonder why would the UFO come down so close
over someone's car are they showing themselves off it certainly looks like
it so many people saw it in this town and in the neighboring areas that it
seems clear the ETS if that's what they were wanted to be
seen now this next case is also very important because it shows how
profoundly a person can be affected by their encounter and in fact I call this
case encounter causes nervous breakdown and this is something we do see
sometimes people are really affected deeply by their Encounters this one
occurred on September 9 1972 over Glasgow Scotland and while
there was a preliminary investigation the reaction of the witness kind of halted the
investigation so it's quite brief but I think still important this case was
never fully investigated for reasons that will soon become a apparent the witness is anonymous and it was around
4:30 a.m. again on September 9 1972 and the witness was in the suburbs
of Glasgow it's not clear whether he was driving or walking outside but he says
he saw an object hovering very low over a street he said this object was shaped
like a spinning top and had a black metal surface with lights flashing underneath he saw Ro of Windows along
the edge and it was inside through one of these windows that this witness saw
an entity a human looking figure with blonde hair wearing a silver suit with
what looked like stripes on the arms and he said this figure was staring out the window directly at him now shortly after
seeing this the object accelerated upwards into the sky and there was only
a preliminary investigation because the witness right after seeing this and apparently as the result of his
encounter suffered a nervous breakdown and refused to talk anymore about it so
this case illustrates why the UFO cover up is so devastating this poor witness really
would have probably done a lot better I think if he had had resources if he
didn't feel like he was so alone uh if there wasn't a cover up this was a subject that could be faced more
headon and be widely accepted but unfortunately we're not there even today
it's one of the reasons why I do this research because this is an important subject and it's time people recognize
that it's real so now we move to another case which is so interesting I call this one
the tall silver man this took place on July 10
1975 in ulo in Wales this is a small little town I like
this case because it's a multiple witness case and it's got corroboration because apparently there were a number
of other incidents of people who kept seeing this same figure this tall silver
suited extraterrestrial it's a very interesting case it was about 100 p.m. on the
afternoon of July 10 1975 as Mr and Miss Taylor drove along
the a55 road at ulo again in Wales and
they came around a bend in the road and this is when they saw a man standing by the side of the road who did not look
normal first of all he was almost 7 ft tall second he was wearing a bright
silver fullbody coverall kind of like a diver's suit they said which covered
every part of his body except his face he did have a normal looking face though
they wondered if he might be wearing a mask they said this figure seemed to
stare at them in kind of a strange way when they first saw him he was standing
at the bottom of a tall embankment sort of facing away from the road as if he
had just finished climbing down this little Hill but as they approached in
their car they said this figure turned to face them kind of watched them as they drove by and as they passed it they
saw this figure bend down and scoop something off the ground with its left
hand now they did see this for only a few seconds or so but they said it was
long enough that they were convinced that he was not a normal person they
actually kept this encounter secret until about two years later when another
lady by the name of Pauline Combs reported seeing apparently the same
figure or certainly a similar one she said it was a seven to eight foot tall
silverclad figure staring into the window of her home in Milford Haven now
Paul's son also saw this figure which disappeared after a car
approached and only two weeks earlier Pauline and her children said that they were actually chased in their car by a
yellow sphere so Mr and Miss Taylor who saw this silver figure standing by the side of
the road never saw any UFO but hearing Pauline com's description of this silver
man and how similar it was to what they saw they wondered if they had seen the same figure and interestingly there are
two other separate Witnesses who saw what might be the same tall silver man
in this same exact area it was 3 years later in July again of
1978 a man was driving with his family and saw this very tall figure he says about 6
and 1/2 ft tall wearing a onepiece silver suit climbing down a hill and
like the tailor he says he watched this figure picking up something off the ground was a very brief sighting but
incredibly similar to what the tailor saw then a few years later in
1982 a motorcyclist said he was driving through this same city ulo around
midnight Midnight and he saw a figure which he says was at least 7 feet tall
maybe more wearing a silvery almost plastic-like space suit and thick boots
he said the figure seemed surprised and somewhat dismayed to have been witnessed by him and the the figure fled the scene
and so did the witness that case is so interesting because people just kept on seeing this same tall silver figure
apparently the same one hard to say for sure but something clearly is going on
in that area and here is another case which I did mention briefly in a previous
episode but I found more information and found out that it in fact does involve humanoids and I call
this one extraterrestrials on Mount Everest Yes you heard me right Mount
Everest who knew but apparently there's not only one encounter but several over
Mount Everest so I'd like to cover that a bit and talk about the person who saw
humanoids on Mount Everest this is back in September 1975 I believe and of course takes place
on Mount Everest the first witness that I could find to UFOs in the area of
Mount Everest is Frank SMI a well-known mountain claimer in fact he's written 27
very po very popular books and he is a legend among mountain
climbers but what few people know is that he claims to have seen a UFO on
Mount Everest way back in 1933 and I'll just quote him directly
because he gives a very interesting account as Frank SMI says in his own words I was still some 200 ft above C6
and a considerable distance horizontally from it when chancing to glance in the
direction of the North Ridge I saw two curious looking objects floating in the
sky they strongly resembled kite balloons in shape but one possessed what
appeared to be squat underdeveloped wings and the other a protuberance
suggestive of a beak they hovered motionless but seemed to pulsate a pulsation much slower than my
own heart beats which is of interest supposing that it was an optical
illusion the two objects were very dark in color and were silhouetted sharply
against the sky or possibly a background of cloud so interested was I that I
stopped to observe them my brain appeared to be working normally and I deliberately put myself through a series
of tests first of all I glanced away the objects did not follow my vision but
they were still there when I looked back again then I looked away again and this
time identified by name a number of Peaks valleys and Glaciers by way of a
mental test but when I looked back again the objects confronted
me at this I gave them up as a bad job but just as I was starting to move again
a Mist suddenly drifted across gradually they disappeared behind it and when a
minute or two later it drifted clear exposing the whole of the North Ridge once more they had vanished as
mysteriously as they came now you have to remember back then there was really no talk whatsoever of
UFOs so that really wasn't something he even considered at the time but now
research are taking a second look at his account thinking perhaps he did see UFOs
because as it turns out he's not the only one reinold Messner is one of the
world's most famous famous and accomplished mountain climbers and in
October of 1981 he went public with his sighting of a
UFO he and his climbing partner Doug Scott were attempting to climb the
24,000 ft Mount shambal along located near Mount Everest in the Himalayas when
they saw a glowing object quote the size of a full moon and as reinold Messner
says it was moving very slowly it moved Eastward and then went again Southwest
and drifted finally North into Tibet according to Reinhold both he and
Doug Scott watched it for a full three hours until it moved off and it was apparently also cited by a nearby joint
polish British Expedition though at a different time but as Doug Scott says in
his own words it could not be a satellite because it moved in an elliptical manner the movements of this
object were irregular we are certain these objects were flying saucers they
were Dome shaped and silver and at night they had a blue and orange lights
flashing around them I wouldn't be surprised if the space aliens had established a kind of beach
head for exploration down in one of the most inaccessible Val
valleys there's no doubt in my mind that these flying saucers were Recon ordering
with a purpose and not just out joy writing so to speak now this account is separate from
the one he saw earlier this was when he was actually climbing Mount
Everest and Doug Scott first wife Jan had actually joined him on the Everest
Expedition while she did remain at the base camp at around 177,000 Ft she says
that she and everyone there all saw these UFOs the whole time they were
there she said that they would fly singly or in small groups usually about five or seven of them and she saw more
than that as Jen says in her own words at first we were frightened by their
presence but after the first day we realized that if these beings had wanted to harm us they would have in the snow
we were defenseless against them and if we never returned from our climb people
in Nepal would merely think we had fallen to our deaths they never bothered us but these alien ships frightened us a
little because they were always there then after 5 days of being followed we
woke up one morning to find the UFOs had vanished just as mysteriously as they
had arrived so Jan reports that she not only saw the UFOs but once one of them
swooped down low enough that she could actually see humanoids looking out the
window of the UFO at her as she says in her own words and I quote I very
definitely saw Eerie luminous creatures almost liquid in their movements in the
windows of a silver crab that followed me when I took a short walk alone from our encampment that
evening was not the effects of the terrible cold and isolation and it
wasn't snow blindness either I found that case super interesting and also
looking into it found that there's quite a history of Supernatural events of all kinds on Mount Everest be it big footer
Yeti sightings and also ghostly encounters with apparently deceased
climbers who died on Mount Everest so there's a whole story there that hasn't been fully
covered it's super interesting and now we move to another case this one is
really poignant and profound I think uh I call this case the injured
humanoid this is a single witness case but by all accounts the witness is
absolutely honest and sincere and saw something very unusual this case took
place on June 12th 1977 in Crystal Lake Illinois and it's
one of the more unusual cases of extraterrestrial contact that I've heard
in some time on June 12 1977 sometime after 11:00 p.m. on this
night I believe I had an encounter of the Third Kind so writes David X in a
letter to Jay Allen heck after seeing Jay Allen Heck on the Phil Donahue show
talking about Close Encounters now on the day of the encounter again June 12th David had just
been laid off from work so he went to meet with his friends at a local hotel
to talk about his experience of being laid off they shared some beers and
talked about it and later around 1100 p.m. David exited the hotel and looking
to his right he got a real shock cuz he saw three short figures walking out of
the alley he said they were each about 4 feet tall each wearing dark green
onepiece suits that had a weird metallic Shimmer and what looked like transparent
Fishbowl like helmets over their heads he could see them quite clearly close
enough that he could see a silver ring connecting the helmets to the jumpsuits and as David says in his own
words the only feature on the face I could see were the eyes they were large
and white that seemed to Glow I could not see a mouth or how their throat or
chin were shaped however I could see the top of the head there was no hair it
looked like bare skull bone their fingers were shaped to a point the hand
was large in proportion to the body size also the feet were
large they were thin and small in size the only outstanding things I seem to
remember now are that when they came into view the atmosphere around me
became like a big vacuum room no sound at all I was not scared for some reason
but I certainly was surprised caught off guard so David is describing what
researchers call the Oz effect this Eerie silence envelops the area often when people see UFOs or
ETS now when he first saw these figures he said they were about 30 to 35 ft away
but we walking towards him he first thought perhaps they might be kids playing a trick on him but he quickly
discarded this Theory as it was too late for kids to be out and nobody knew that
he was about to step out out of this hotel so it couldn't be a trick he thought at first that these figures were
coming to get him but this was when he noticed a fourth identical figure lying
on the ground literally right in front of him and David had the distinct
impression that this being was injured or hurt in some way because it was laying on its side with its head on its
chest and its knees tucked up to its body he watched as these three beings
approached and began to scoop up their fallen comrade and in fact at this point
David said he was only a few feet away from them close enough to touch them if
he wanted but he did not do this he watched as these figures picked up the
Fallen figure and sort of carried him and walked him back into the alley to on
one side and the other right behind him he said this Fallen figure walked slowly
and stooped over as though he was injured so David at this point had the
feeling that these beings were talking telepathically to him telling him not to
be afraid that they were not going to harm him and he said when they were at
their closest approached he got a good look at their hands and it looked as though they had only three or four
fingers though he says he's not completely sure about this he only saw for a few moments before they walked
back into the alley now instead of following them David says he ran quickly
back into the hotel to tell his friends to his disappointment they did not
believe him and actually ridiculed him but he's insists he's telling the truth
it really quite traumatized him to a certain extent and two days later he
decided he was going to report this event to the police but because of the reaction he got from other others he
really didn't talk about it as David says in his own words I did tell a few
people what happened no one believed me some of the people laughed so I decided
not to tell any more people but I did report what happened to the Crystal Lake
Police my wife is the only person who I think might believe me at least she says
she believes me but how would you think about such a crazy story so yeah this
did reach J Allen highneck and the center for UFO studies who did an
investigation and interestingly and perhaps in confirmation of David's sighting there was in fact a UFO
sighting at Mount Vernon on that night which is about 320 mies distant from Crystal Lake it's
unfortunate that that witness did receive ridicule from people who he thought were his friends still are his
friends I suppose but this ridicule factor is one of the major forces that
keeps people from sharing their Encounters in a more open way so again
we're all victims of this UFO coverup that sooner or later has got to end it's
just not sustainable as I've said before you can't hide the sky sooner or later
the truth is going to come out and we're seeing that and here is another case
which again speaks to how common UFO encounters are and this one is a really
important case because I think it shows one of the ET agendas which is their
concern over our use of nuclear material I call this one robotic alien at Atomic
installation and this case did get a lot of attention you may have heard of it but if not you should have because I
think it's an important case for those reasons it took place on March 7 17
1978 in rizley England and it's got some really
compelling physical evidence that goes along with it as well as well as
some peripheral corroborating evidence in terms of other Witnesses seeing
activity around that time it was around 11:00 p.m. again on March 17
1978 as an engineer by the name of Kenneth Edwards was driving his van
along the m62 motorway adjacent to what was then an atomic energy and research
installation and looking to his right he saw this very strange looking silver
suited figure walking in a strange stooped fashion with its arms stretched
out forward as it walked down an embankment that posture he says was
almost impossible to maintain while walking down an embankment so that's kind of what caught his attention and he
did drive this route regularly and he knew it was unusual to see anyone out there at this time of night but it was
really this figure's strange outfit and the way that it was walking that really puzzled him so he says he came to a stop
about 150 ft away from it and he could now see that this figure was about 7 ft
tall said it was weird because it walked without bending its knees also its arms
seemed to be joined to its chest rather than its shoulders it was completely
silver except for the head which was dark and round he did see two small
eyes and this being crossed the road in front of his car at kind of an angle
moving towards him and as it crossed the road it came to about 30 ft in front of
Ken and then stopped and stood in the center of the road and this is when
Kenneth now began to feel some fear and his fear actually increased when this
figure turned its head and looked directly at him projecting what looked
like two Pencil Thin beams of light from its eyeh holes now these beams of light
actually struck Ken in his van said at this point time seemed to stop he felt
strangely dizzy he felt like he was paralized and something was pressing down on his body and as Ken says the
pressure was tremendous it seemed to paralyze me I could only move my eyes
the rest of me was rigid so he's not sure how long this confrontation landed he estimates about
a minute but he kept thinking to himself is this something from outer space and
what does it want with me finally the figure continued walking approaching he
says to about 15 ft in front of his van and then it approached the security
fence by this Atomic installation raised its arms and to Ken's astonishment
walked right through the fence as if it wasn't even there Ken was so shaken by
this encounter that he just sat there in his car trying to collect himself for
about 20 minutes as he says 20 minutes seems like a long time I know but I was
petrified and I do not want to go through that again so Ken then drove home and he noce he
got home an hour later than he normally would have he's not willing to say for
sure that he had missing time but he wonders about it but upon arriving home
he quickly took a shot of whiskey and told his wife Barbara quote I've seen a
silver man he tried to relax and go to bed but he was unable to sleep and finally he
told his wife I I think I'd better go to the police will you take me she of
course agreed the police took his report took were very much accepting of his
testimony and then returned with him to the scene they could not find any evidence of the UFO or or any UFO or any
ET but it was clear to them that something had happened and as his wife Barbara says he had been very badly
shaken and I don't know what to make of it I would have to see it myself to really believe it but he saw something
strange I know now there were some really strange after effects Ken says he had trouble
sleeping for several days after this encounter he noticed his watch had
stopped at 11:45 exactly he says a few days after the
encounter he did noticed three small dark marks on his fingers kind of like a sunburn which weren't there before
but most strange he had an expensive radio transmitter in his car which was
now burned Beyond repair it appeared to have been subjected to a massive power
surge and he connects this to his encounter so Ken's encounter did receive
a lot of publicity he was interviewed by several investigators in fact on March 23rd not
long after his encounter he returned to the site of the encounter with one investigator and at one point this
investigator left Ken was now alone at the top of the embankment where he had first seen this figure when he again
started to feel this strange pressure again and boom he saw this figure
walking away from him so this is the second sighting of the same figure in the same area and it really quite scared
him and he fled in fear was 10 days later on April 2nd he
was driving the same route again and he felt that strange pressure once again he
quickly drove off and since then he has refused to drive along this route and
takes the long way around finally 10 days later after this on April 12th Ken
says he was awakened by a strange buzzing noise filling the house he
opened the window and looked outside didn't see anything he did notice that the buzzing sound was louder but there
was no craft or anything visible though investigators later interviewed two
witnesses in that area in rizley who said that on that night they heard the
buzzing noise and did in fact see a red oval object moving
overhead it's quite an amazing encounter unfortunately four years following his
encounter Ken passed away from cancer it's definitely the kind of case that
makes you wonder and it certainly makes me feel for the people who have these encounters because once again you see
how profoundly it affects them and now for our final case of this
episode I call this one reptilians over electric station and this again betrays
one of the ET agendas that are often seen over technological installations of
all kinds and I think that's what was going on in this case where two
witnesses saw a UFO hovering very low over a large electrical plant this case
took place in the fall of 1989 or 1990 they're not exactly sure of the date but
it's a very compelling case which took place in St CLA Quebec in Canada they
saw this UFO very close up some very unusual looking humanoids as well well
and just an interesting case all around this final and very unusual case
involves two witnesses a couple who one afternoon in 1989 or 1990 they're not
exactly sure but they were driving by an electrical plant in St CLA
Quebec Shantal the lady noticed it first and thought it looked kind of like a
boat in the sky her husband didn't see it her partner and as they continued to
drive she lost sight of it but moments later as they were just beginning to
pass this electrical plant they both saw this object crossing the road in front
of them and going directly over the plant and as the husband says all of a
sudden just above the way we saw the UFO pass very slowly over the road while we
Advanced it was going to hover on top of the power plant and then it stopped there was not a helicopter no propeller
nothing no sound it looked like it was colored rust it was solid this was not a
light ship so they stopped the car and looked and at this point this object was only
about 50 ft away was a weird sort of teardrop shaped with an open section
like a cockpit but to them it looked open to the air there was no glass or enclosure around
it and in this opening they could see two strange figures standing one behind
another and regarding these figures uh he says quote was not human you could
see that it was not humans who were there the shape of the skull the face
that I saw at the distance was reptilian it is not as smooth as a human it was
not smooth skin he had dark skin was not white skin it was the same type of
reptile you see drawn in this book so they pointed to these figures here and
said it looked very similar to these but as he says the one behind I remember
very well that he turned his head towards us so it was clear that these
beings knew they were being observed and as the main witness says we clearly saw
that in the front of the UFO there were two beings there one forward and the other right behind then suddenly inside
my head it tells me do not stay here go away go away so they got a telepathic
message from these beings that who perhaps did not want to be observed and
in fact the witness says he drove off in kind of a days and after driving a about
200 ft he felt almost as if he had woke up and this was when he realized he had
had a camera right next to him and didn't even think of using it it's a
very closeup of Encounter of ETS apparently examining an
electrical installation so what a case that is and once again we have a witness
who has a camera right next to him and doesn't even think of using it that
turns up enough times in cases like these that it makes you wonder what is
going on here it can be very shocking to see a UFO so I think people aren't
always prepared and it's hard to look away from something that is so unusual I
mean Witnesses often say they could barely believe their own eyes but yeah
they saw it very close as I said in the beginning of this episode there's very little chance of misperception in these
cases es when you are close enough to see an ET face to face there is no misinterpreting it you
are having a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid so that's the episode for today
again cases coming from all over the world reaching back through time continuing up to pretty much the present
day humanoids of all different types but always humanoids
there's an important takeaway I think from that alone which shows once again
we all share a common Heritage a message so many contactees have
received and again the evidence it always makes me kind of smile in a weird
way when people say that there's no evidence because there is animal
reactions and electromagnetic disturbances and medical effects of all kinds and Landing traces and so much more as
these few cases here show which of course are just the tip of the
iceberg so that's it for tonight thank you once again for watching I truly
appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers keep looking for
the truth and keep having fun until next time bye now.
