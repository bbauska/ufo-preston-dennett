HUMANOIDS AND HIGH STRANGENESS IN NEVADA: FIVE TRUE CASES
Dec 23, 2022

Summary:
Dec 23, 2022
Among the closest of UFO encounters are cases involving strange humanoids. It’s one thing to see an unidentified flying object from a distance, it’s quite another to see a gray alien, have missing time or even be taken onboard a craft. It’s these types of encounters where we learn the truth about UFO contact and what it’s like to meet an extraterrestrial face-to-face. This video presents five true accounts of humanoids and high strangeness from the state of Nevada. Of course, humanoids are seen all over the world. And Nevada is no exception. In fact, Nevada has many accounts of this kind. What follows are five of the weirdest and most bizarre.

SHARLEEN’S ONBOARD ENCOUNTER. One evening in Jul of 1964, Sharleen Nicholson was six-months pregnant when her house in Las Vegas began to vibrate with a buzzing noise. A light flooded through the windows. Venturing outside, she saw a saucer landed in the field by her home. Sharleen became filled with a strange calmness. The next thing she knew, she was back inside her home. By morning, she had forgotten the entire experience. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy. A few months later, during a baby shower, someone mentioned the word “UFO,” and the memory of her encounter returned. Had she been taken onboard? She wasn’t sure. 

BOY SHOOTS A GRAY ALIEN. Early one morning in 1970, a father took his 7-year-old son rabbit hunting in the desert east of Reno. He stayed in the car drinking beer while his son took his rifle and searched out his quarry. After shooting a rabbit, he set his sights on another. That’s when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Looking in that direction, he was shocked to see a short gray-skinned figure with large dark eyes. When it raised its hand toward him, the witness swung his rifle around and shot. The strange creature dropped to the desert floor. Filled with fear and remorse, the boy dropped the rifle and ran back to his father who disbelieved him and told him to go back and get the gun. Upon returning to the site, the strange humanoid figure was gone. But up in the sky was a large cigar-shaped craft. The next thing the boy knew, he was taken onboard. 

MISSING TIME IN INDIAN SPRINGS. On the evening of Dec 3, 1983, a small group of airmen from Creech AFB in Indian Springs hiked a few miles off-base to have a little beer-keg party. Growing tired, one of them decided to walk back to the base dorms. But his journey back was interrupted. Growing cold, he hunched down to warm up. The next thing he knew, he was waking up to find a man hold a gun to his head. He was sleeping on a couch in the home of a complete stranger. He and the homeowner were mystified as the house was protected by a tall fence and a guard-dog, and all the doors and the windows had been locked from the inside. Even stranger, there was a large incision on his abdomen. 

THE ABDUCTION OF ALEX PODOVICH. On Nov 7, 2002, Las Vegas resident, Alex Podovich woke up to find a strange glowing light descending upon him. His body became paralyzed and he felt himself moving through the air. The next thing he knew, he was lying naked on a strange bed in a weird room, surrounded by humanoid figures with weird eyes. A bizarre ring-like device was fitted over his head. So began a series of encounters with apparent extraterrestrials. At first Alex had no fear. But he soon came to believe that the ETs were taking his reproductive material to produce hybrid children. Later experiences with the ETs would seem to confirm this. Alex then decided that these encounters were not in his best interests and he began to resist them. 

HUMANOIDS ON ROUTE 95. On the evening of Dec 8, 2006, a married couple decided take a road trip from Las Vegas to the remote desert town of Beatty, NV. Their journey took them along Route 95 which led them through the town of Indian Springs and deep into the Nevada desert. At some point during their trip, they noticed a light hovering ahead of them on the highway. Slowing down, they saw that the light was actually a scraft hovering only a few hundred feet high. Even more shocking, through the windows they could see several strange humanoid figures both sitting down and standing, all of them looking down at them from above. It was instantly clear to both of them that the figures were not human.

As can be seen, Nevada has no shortage of humanoids and high strangeness. About 87 percent of the state is owned by the Federal Government. It is also the location of the infamous Area 51, believed by many to be an area involving the reverse-engineering of UFO craft. Whatever the case, it’s clear that something very profound is happening in the Silver State.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Bennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode is called humanoids and high strangeness in Nevada five true cases 
cases involving humanoids onboard experiences face-to-face encounters missing time these 
are my favorite I think these are far more interesting than sightings although sightings are interesting but these cases these very close encounters I think have a lot more information 
a lot more to tell us about the nature of extraterrestrials and their presence on our 
planet so that's what I'd like to talk about today of course these cases occur all over the 
world but today I'm going to focus exclusively on cases in Nevada I did a big study of UFO 
Encounters in Nevada wrote a whole book about it and I picked five of what I think are the most 
interesting unique credible and extensive cases and those are the ones I'd like to present today 
so let's just get started and the first case I want to talk about I call case one the onboard 
experiences of Charlene this case took place around 1964 in a suburb of Las Vegas in July 
of 1964 Charlene Nicholson that's a pseudonym was living in a suburb of Las Vegas and was six 
months pregnant one night she was lying in bed trying unsuccessfully to get comfortable when 
she remembered that she had forgotten to take her pregnancy medicine she went to the kitchen and 
took her pill and wondered why it was suddenly so light outside this was at night suddenly the room 
began to shake and Charlene assumed that there was a small earthquake however immediately afterwards 
she heard a strange buzzing noise she checked all the appliances and finally realized that the noise 
was actually coming from outside and she went to the front door to investigate and this is where it 
got really strange and Charlene describes in her own words what happened next as she says 
when I opened the door all these bright lights are in my face I can't see so I keep covering my eyes 
with my hands trying to peek out I imagine there's been a car accident on the hill above me but there 
are no sounds and when the lights dim they're in front of me in the vacant lot sits a flying saucer 
I don't believe in flying saucers I think I go into shock because the next thing I 
remember is standing in my living room with my hands to my sides clenched in fists I have 
no words I am fighting to get words my mind is a blank slate and it's been wiped clean 
I am fighting so hard I can feel a fine sweat breakout on my forehead 
so at this point Charlene starts searching her mind for the explanation of what she was 
looking at they're outside it was a flying saucer she realized and she returned back 
outside to take another look and as she says I go to the front door it's just sitting there 
red white and green lights form a Halo near the top and they are flashing on and off in 
Rhythm it's humming I watch it I look at my new princess phone but don't use it I think of waking 
my husband but don't all that separates me from the saucer is a tall wooden fence 
I go to the fence and peek over I can see the rim around it but I can't see the bottom 
and look at all the houses no one is out but me I am alone intrigued but afraid I go to the end of 
of the fence become afraid and go back I look for Windows or doors on the craft but I don't see any 
it glows from inside the lights keep going on and off and it keeps humming I closed the door slapped 
my face and opened the door it's still there and I keep watching I find myself leaning relaxed and 
comfortable against the door frame I am alarmed something is wrong how could I be so relaxed 
so this puzzled Charlene and her next memory was of walking to the bedroom and going to sleep 
this is not how she thought she would react though this is quite common in UFO encounters 
the next morning Charlene told her husband that she saw some funny lights outside and 
after that her memory of the entire event became completely erased she didn't remember it at all 
however after that night Charlene found herself avoiding the vacant lot which she used to often 
cross as it was a shortcut to the local convenience store but she didn't want to 
go there anymore and she wasn't even sure why she told herself that she was just avoiding the hill 
time marched on and two months later Charlene and her husband had a beautiful baby boy but it wasn't 
until one month later in October that Charlene's friends surprised her with a baby shower 
and one of her friends just happened to mention that she had just read a book about flying saucers 
and as if On Cue Charlene's memory of her encounter flooded back into her mind 
she blurted out her story to her friends who all looked at her like she was crazy 
still Charlene couldn't get the experience out of her mind she began to study and read about 
UFOs and she soon learned about the phenomenon of missing time and abductions and wondered if that 
had happened to her so she went to a therapist who agreed to hypnotize her but warned her that 
he didn't believe in UFOs and thought that she had probably been traumatized by some other event 
so together they had three sessions but Charlene's resistance to recalling the event was too strong 
to overcome years later she tried again with only limited success on this occasion she did 
recall feeling a strange movement as if she was being lifted up into the sky she also had a Clear 
Vision of her house and property from an elevated position and then she recalled seeing shadowy 
figures approaching her but beyond that her memory stopped she just couldn't get through this memory 
block and 40 years later Charlene is now in her 60s and is still wondering about this incident 
as she says and I quote I feel time is running out to get this resolved and I've come to believe it's 
possible that my incident had missing time I can't say that I was abducted I truly hope I wasn't that 
something is wrong why is this still affecting me so strongly and why did I go back to bed 
why was I leaning on the door frame when I should have been on the alert even as I write this I vacillate part of me wants to find out and the other part is frightened 
I think you'll agree that's a pretty interesting case and I like it because it shows how a person 
can have missing time and then suddenly spontaneously remember so let's move to the 
second case which I think is even more interesting I call this one case two a boy shoots a gray alien 
this is a really dramatic case and I don't think you've heard of this one before either and uh yes 
I think this does have something to say about UFOs extraterrestrials and how we interact with them 
and that's why I wanted to cover it today and this one takes place outside of Reno about 30 
miles east of Reno Nevada out in the desert area it was around 1970 at about 10 a.m in the morning 
at the time the main witness was only seven years old and his father was taking him out hunting 
four years earlier actually on the witnesses third birthday his dad had given him a 22 caliber 
rifle and taught him to shoot and hunt on this particular night he still had this same rifle 
and they were going out rabbit hunting his father stayed in the van drinking beer while the witness 
began shooting at rabbits and he had just killed and retrieved one when he saw another rabbit 
so he aimed his gun at this rabbit when suddenly he saw movement in his periphery 
something else was approaching him and according to the researcher who investigated this case the witness saw a quote thing standing there staring at him and I'd 
just like to read to you a little quote from the investigators report as the investigator writes 
he described the thing as about his same height as he was which he estimated to be about four feet 
tall very skinny with long arms a large head with large dark eyes and was grayish in color 
he said he was immediately frightened but had kept his rifle pointed in the direction of the rabbit 
the witness said he remembered keeping the thing within his peripheral vision and noticed that it 
started turning its head slightly to its right in the direction of the rabbit the witness had 
intended to shoot however the thing then turned its head back looking at him and simultaneously 
began raising its arm held straight out the witness said he became extremely frightened 
and thought the thing was about to do something to hurt him so he swung his rifle in the direction 
of the thing and fired one shot into the upper right side of its chest and it fell to the ground 
so yeah he shot at this gray alien and frightened the child dropped his rifle and the rabbit he had 
just shot and returned to the van to tell his father unfortunately his dad did not believe him 
and became angry that his son had actually left the rifle behind and ordered him to go back and 
retrieve it so that's what the kid did he returned and found the rifle and the rabbit but there was 
no sign of this strange creature that he had shot he was examining the area looking for blood or 
any evidence when he did in fact see a quote cigar shaped craft hovering about 200 feet away from him 
he said it was metallic and huge about as long as a football field and again I'd like to quote 
the investigator to this case directly as the investigator says the next detail he remembered 
was being in some type of room with beams like framework in what appeared to be a lot of dust 
he was frightened and crying and the next thing he remembers is being in the back seat of the van 
alone in the dark crying for his dad who wasn't there he said he now believes that they still 
had his dad so following that his next memory is of driving home in the dark with his dad 
they had lost he estimates several hours of time this was also unusual because normally 
they returned before dark so they could clean and prepare the rabbits for eating 
the witness questioned his dad why it was so late but his father didn't respond and according to the investigator of this case the witness is certain that 
he and his dad had both been taken on board and somehow returned to their van 
the father refused to discuss with his son what had happened or talk about that hunting incident 
the witness reported feeling guilty for shooting what he now believes was an extraterrestrial 
and there was apparently some consequences to this because in the months following this 
incident this child felt the presence of someone watching him also he says a strange gray patch 
of hair appeared on his head which caused much questioning and teasing from the people around 
him he had no explanation for it but feels like it had something to do with this encounter 
he also began having problems with his throat and ears and later underwent multiple medical 
examinations by different doctors who have been unable to find the cause of his problems 
and according to the witness one doctor did in fact confirm the presence of what appears to be 
some kind of implant in one of his ears but he has no health insurance so the witness has been unable 
to investigate this any further but at least one of the doctors thought there was a type of 
implant in his ear uh without health insurance he couldn't pay for any procedure to remove it 
but it wasn't long before this same witness reported further encounters 
he recalled being taken inside a craft which he says was quote just controlled by the placement 
of hands on the inside surface of the craft there were no controls or anything tangible seen 
so in events continued and it was in the first week of November 2012 while on 
the property north of his home that he saw what he believes are the same beings again 
he now says that he has visions and dreams of them constantly and the investigator of this case was 
told by the witness that he continues to recall more memories of his encounters as time goes on 
so that's all the information I have on this case it's still ongoing I think you'll agree that's a very unusual case so now let's move to case three I this is one involving very 
high strangeness I call this case three missing time in Indian Springs and this took place on 
December 3rd 1983 to a group of Airmen stationed at Indian Springs Air Force Base there's a lot of 
UFO Encounters in this area and this one is a very unusual case again this case occurred on December 
3rd 1983 when a group of eight Airmen who were stationed at Indian Springs Air Force Base decided 
to head a few miles off the base on out into the desert with a keg of beer and have a little party 
there wasn't really much else to do in this area it was around 2 A.M when one 
of the Airmen became tired and decided he was going to walk back to the dorms 
the friend that had driven him there wanted to stay so Stephen as I call him that's a 
pseudonym he decided that he would just walk back to the base which was only about three miles away 
it was a pretty cold night but he was warmly dressed he left the party and began walking home 
and he was less than halfway back to the base he began to shiver from the cold and he describes 
what happened next as the witness says I kneeled down to gather some body heat the next thing I 
know is that I am waking up with a man on top of me with a gun stuck between my eyes 
he was the owner of the home I had gotten into so looking around Stephen discovered that he 
had somehow lost Consciousness and was now in the home of a private residence of a complete stranger 
and this man wanted to know how Stephen had gotten into his house as all the doors and windows were 
still locked and the yard was fenced in with a watchdog Stephen was unable to provide an answer 
he had no memory of how he had gotten into the house the owner kept him at gunpoint while his 
wife called the police very strange and as the witness writes and I quote when the police arrived 
they simply drove me to the base and left me with my base commander the homeowner had found me 
sleeping on his couch in his living room I had a pillow under my head and a blanket over me neither 
I nor the homeowner knew each other and neither one of us had any idea how I got into his home 
so Steve's base commander was left speechless by the incident as was Steve himself Steve was his 
Administrative Assistant and the base commander knew that Steve would not do anything which would 
jeopardize his job but most alarming was the fact that the witness had a clean deep cut on 
his abdomen there was no bleeding however and this mysterious wound healed with amazing speed 
so later after talking to his fellow Airmen Steve discovered that about an hour after he left the 
keg party in the desert his buddies observed some quote strange lights in the area where he had been 
Steve has no memory of this and remains baffled about what happened to him only 
later did he speculate on the possibility that the incident might have been UFO related 
as he writes and I quote I've never found out what exactly happened to me that night and 
nobody in the small town of Indian Springs Nevada ever came forward with any kind of explanation 
I do remember having another incident when I was a child but that's for another time 
so yeah it does appear that he is probably a contact D because many contactees do have 
experiences as a young child but as of yet he has no memory of what happened during this period of 
missing time yeah that is a remarkable case I'm not quite sure what to make of it but I thought it 
deserved a place on this episode and now I'd like to talk about case four which I call the Abduction 
of Alex potovich Alex actually wrote his encounter for fate magazine also put out a book about his 
own encounters I think it's a quite interesting case which took place in 2002 outside of Las Vegas 
as Alex potovich writes I was consciously abducted on the night of November 6 to 7 2002. 
he wrote this in a letter to fate magazine and again he's a resident of Las Vegas 
he had gone to sleep about 10 30 PM that evening and later at around 12 25 A.M Alex says he woke 
up to a very strange experience as he writes in fate magazine half asleep I felt and saw a green 
yellow ball of energy attach itself to my neck between my head and the beginning of my spine 
the ball of energy split into two parts and surged down my arms at the speed of light 
I felt the energy rolling down my arms from my shoulders it felt like I was being pinned down 
all of a sudden I was paralyzed there was no fear Alex writes that he then perceived that his bed 
was moving and then next he felt himself actually moving through space making a few turns and then 
ended up lying naked on a bed of some kind in a large hallway in a room with several other beds 
he felt some sort of ring-like device was holding his head down and it caused a slight burning 
sensation and looking to his side he saw an E.T looking hand and arm as he says it was brown in 
color and had three claws to his left he was aware of another being he glanced over and as 
he says all I saw was an eye it was black with a white pupil and red streaks running through it 
looking to his right he was shocked to see his aunt who appeared to be scared and on the verge 
of crying he remembers trying to comfort her and then recalls seeing the head of one of 
these beings which he said quote look like a brown wrinkled skull so after an undetermined amount of 
time Alex woke up and looking at the clock he was confused to see that it now read 11 55 P.M 
so this was very confusing to him as he says I came back at least 30 minutes before I left 
so this is definitely a very strange time anomaly 
and at first he was very very confused about what had just happened it was only after a 
few minutes that he calmed down and came to a conclusion as Alex writes I had been abducted 
I sensed that I had been sexually drained it felt like every membrane in my body was dry 
my upper back was hot and my head was burning at the hairline where the ring had been placed 
Alex says that following this every night for the next week the 
ETS arrived attempting first to get inside his head inside his Consciousness and on each 
occasion he says he was able to mentally fight them off with determined willpower 
so looking back at his life Alex realized that he had actually been having encounters 
his entire life and he believes that the ETS were taking his reproductive material and he 
began to wonder if he had Offspring children Somewhere Out There and then he says that one 
day he had an out of body experience which actually provided an answer to this question 
and as Alex writes I was in my astral body standing in front of a huge transparent wall 
on the other side were two beings about seven feet tall they looked human they had blue eyes 
and blonde hair they appeared to lack emotions and were staring into space they were identical 
and at this point I noticed another being approaching the barrier on the other side 
he appeared humanoid and was smiling his hands were different as were the finger arrangement 
I cannot recall if you had three or four fingers but it came to the barrier and placed his hand 
on it directly this being appeared to be between 14 and 16 years old I felt my energy in him and 
I knew that he was my son so his initial reaction to this experience was to attempt to continue to 
contact the beings as he says I wanted to learn from them and to teach them as well 
however recently Alex says he has developed some fear regarding his encounters he wonders what 
kind of being would create another child using his genetics without his conscious permission 
and causing him so much fear as he says these were not the actions of evolved compassionate beings 
they were not concerned with my well-being at all this was his impression so now he has no desire 
to have extraterrestrial contact and as he writes as a result of these experiences I have written a 
small guide on how to stop these abductions I hope that it will help other people free themselves 
so you can see that encounter did affect Alex potovich quite profoundly 
and now we get to the final case in this presentation and I call this case five 
humanoids along Route 95. this is a briefcase but I think pretty interesting and unusual 
and it involved a couple who was driving along Route 95 on the way from Las Vegas to BT Nevada 
and as you will see they had a very interesting encounter it was around 9 00 pm on December 8 
2006 when Charles Gantry and his wife Teresa these are pseudonyms were driving north on 
Route 95 between Las Vegas and BT in Nevada by the way Indian Springs is right in between 
these two cities so this is an area where there does appear to be a lot of UFO activity and it 
was Charles who noticed it first a bright light hovering up ahead on the west side of the highway 
he assumed it was connected to a power line Tower but as they approached they could both see that 
this light was not attached to anything and as they drove alongside the object they both had to 
peer upward through the windshield of their car to observe it and what they saw was an apparent UFO 
there was a porthole and they could see humanoid figures looking back at them 
and I'll just quote the witness directly as Charles says we both observed a cylinder-shaped 
object about as long as the city bus suspended in the air there was a window across the cylinder and 
the window appeared to be at a 45 degree angle downward facing toward us there appeared to be 
a panel of some kind along the entire length of the window there were figures seated at the panel 
across the length of the object and what appeared to be several figures standing behind them 
my wife and I both got the feeling that the figures inside the object were looking at us 
so they're driving by this thing along the highway at a pretty good speed and they could see that the interior of the craft was also brightly illuminated they both agreed that 
it was totally silent in just a few moments they drove right by it Charles turned to his wife and 
asked do you want to turn around and go back and she nodded and exclaimed yes so Charles quickly 
pulled a u-turn at the next available spot and when they approached the spot where they had 
seen this thing the object was still there but as they arrived the object suddenly streaked 
off moving set near the speed of light it Rose over a mountain and descended behind it heading 
towards they believed Las Vegas and it was four years following this incident that the witnesses 
decided to report their sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center and as you can see it's 
quite an amazing case those are the five cases I wanted to present to you today I think they are 
all quite interesting all pretty extensive four out of five of them do involve humanoids I think 
probably the missing time in Indian Springs one also involves humanoids he just doesn't remember 
but these are all really interesting cases in which people have had really close contact with 
UFOs and extraterrestrials again this is a worldwide phenomenon but these cases are all 
from Nevada I did present them in my book UFOs over Nevada in a true history of extraterrestrial 
Encounters in the silver state so if you want to read more about them you can definitely 
check that book out uh but that's it for today I hope you've enjoyed this episode as much as I've 
enjoyed making it for you I want to thank you very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until 
next time keep looking for answers keep asking questions and most importantly keep having fun.
