IT WAS NOT HUMAN! SEVEN SHOCKING HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Jul 4, 2025

Summary:
Jul 4, 2025
One of the most interesting aspects of the UFO phenomenon are humanoid encounters, and there are a lot of them. People across the world report a wide variety of humanoids: grays, reptilian creatures, human-looking figures, short humanoids and more. While most cases go unreported, there is now a worldwide database of many thousands of encounters, many supported by multiple eyewitnesses, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, landing traces and more. In this video we explore seven shocking humanoid encounters. In each case the witnesses were thrust into the unknown and confronted with something beyond their imagination.

THE LOVELAND HUMANOIDS. At 3:30 am on May 25, 1955, Robert Hunnicutt was driving home when he noticed three odd-looking figures standing by the road in Branch Hill, Ohio. He stopped his car and was shocked to see that the figures were not human. They had thin misshapen bodies and frog-like faces. They turned to look at him and he froze. The next thing he knew, he was racing off to the Loveland police station. Unknown to Robert, other people had reported UFOs in the area that same evening. This was the first of many humanoid and UFO encounters in the area.

SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS OUT THERE. On the night of November 13, 1967, a young couple drove stopped along a forested country road in Surrey, England. Smelling a foul odor, they were about to drive off when a strange humanoid appeared next to their car. It had a white featureless face and a dark body. The couple drove off in fear. One year later in the same area, another young couple experienced a similar encounter. As it turned out, the area has a long history of incredible UFO activity and more bizarre humanoid encounters.

I WAS GLUED TO THE GROUND. It was a quiet night on July 22, 1968, at the Pereyra Psychiatric Hospital in Mendoza, Argentina as nurse Adela Casalvieri was drawn outside by a loud buzzing noise. Stepping into the courtyard, she was immediately struck by a red beam of light. The beam retracted and she saw a large craft covered with colored lights. Through several portholes she could see humanoid figures moving about. The craft darted off, leaving radiation marks on the ground, and burns on Adela’s hands and face. Other people saw the craft, and soon many people were reporting UFOs and humanoids.

ETS AT THE ELECTRICAL STATION. On the night of July 23, 1968, security guard Daildo de Oliveira was making his rounds at the Central Power Plant in Bauru, Brazil. He noticed two men in dark jumpsuits trespassing one of the offices and confronted them. A physical fight ensued. A third man appeared, this one dressed in a light jumpsuit. The three intruders wrestled Daildo to the ground. Subduing him, they quickly walked off and entered a large metallic craft landed on the ground a short distance away. It rose up, zigzagged and darted away at high speed.

IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. On the night of July 19, 1972, a young man was playing basketball in the barn next to his home in Pioneer, Michigan when he noticed an intense ball of swirling light near him. He watched in shock as the light suddenly elongated and out stepped a gray alien. The witness felt a strange pressure in his head as the being tried to communicate with him telepathically. He ran off and told his mother. Later that night, they both saw a UFO while driving, and later, the boy would have a very close-up encounter with a UFO.

THIS CREATURE WAS NOT HUMAN. For the past few nights, “Sarah,” had noticed unusual lights near her home in rural Clovis, California. On the morning of November 10, 1986, she decided to hike out to the area with her dog to investigate. Suddenly an intense fear overwhelmed her for no apparent reason. Her dog was mysteriously gone. Turning around, she saw a short gray alien staring at her. It lifted its hand and waved at her. Sarah ran home and realized she was missing two hours of time. She forgot the event until one year later, when she woke up to find a gray alien in her bedroom.

AN ALIEN BESIDE MY BED. In the middle of the night on August 25, 2022, Natalie woke up in her bedroom to see a shadowy figure with a huge head standing by her bed, touching her knee. It sent a message telling her not to be afraid. With a shock, Natalie realized it was an alien. The figure disappeared. Following the encounter, Natalie discovered that she was cured of her chronic insomnia. But following this incident, she began to wake up with her clothes on wrong and strange marks on her body. Soon she had another encounter.

These seven humanoid encounters provide a tantalizing glimpse into what it’s like to have direct contact with extraterrestrials. And yet they are just the tip of the iceberg. The truth about ET contact has been covered up for too long. It’s time for all humanity to know that there is other life in the universe. And they find humanity of great interest.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal. I'm going to be covering humanoids today. Today's episode is called It Was Not Human. Seven shocking humanoid encounters. And yes, believe me, these are quite
shocking, very unusual cases. These seven cases come from all over the
world. I've got four from the United States, including California, Michigan,
North Carolina, and Ohio, and three from outside of the United States, including
England, Argentina, and Brazil. These do cover quite a long period of time. The
earliest is 1955, and the latest is 2022.
So, yeah, a good period of time there. All different types of ETSs. We do see
grays. We do see humanlooking ETSs. Some very unusual looking ones as well. I
also am happy to say that a number of these cases are multiple witness cases.
Also quite a bit of supporting evidence. The four main types of evidence we often
see which include physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances,
animal reactions, and of course landing traces. And I really dug deep in a lot of these
cases. So, it's not just a singular incident in most of these. I went down
the rabbit hole and some of these rabbit holes had rabbit holes themselves. So, yeah, I really dug deep on this one. I
hope you enjoy it. Let's get started. First case I'd like to talk about, I call the Loveland humanoids. This took
place on May 25, 1955. technically in Branch Hill, Ohio, but this is right on
the border of Loveland. And I must say it is one of several cases in this area,
which is not a huge city by any means. So, I think you'll find this one
particularly unusual. And yeah, so many cases going on here. Not exactly sure
why, but it sure is interesting. This case involves at least five humanoid
reports. The first comes from Leonard Stringfield and Ted Bletcher, both respected researchers. The witness is
Robert Honeyut, a restaurant worker. He was at first anonymous, but we now know his real name. It was about 3:30 a.m. on
May 25, 1955, as Robert was driving north on the Madera Loveland Pike. He was very close
to Hopewell Road. You can see it here. and coming down a slight grade in the road, his headlights illuminated what he
first thought were three men kneeling down on the burm along the right side of the road. And as he says, "My first
impression was that there were three crazy guys praying by the side of the road or somebody was hurt or some crazy
guys were having fun." So he was curious and wondering what three guys would be doing praying in the middle of the night
along the highway. He stopped his car about 20 feet away from them and looked at them. And that's when he realized
that these figures were not human. He said they were shorter than normal people. They were in a triangular
position facing the road. One was closer to the shoulder and the other two were kind of flanking behind him, but this
closest figure had his arms and hands over his head and appeared to be holding some kind of rod.
In fact, Robert could see electric blue white sparks jumping back and forth from one hand to the other just above and
below this rod-like instrument. And Robert had the impression that these
beings were concentrating on a spot on the other side of the road. So, he became even more curious and exited his
vehicle. Immediately, the closest forward figure lowered his arms and
appeared to attach this object to his ankles. Now, Robert was still standing next to
the driver's side door when all three of these figures turned to their left and stared directly at him, and he could now
see them in detail. Each figure, he said, was about three and a half feet tall. They had gray skin and gray
clothes. They had normal eyes, but no eyebrows that he could see. He didn't really notice any nose, but their
mouths, he said, crossed the entire lower section of the face and they had no lips. He also said that they had bald
heads with what looked like rolls of fat running across the forehead and smooth
gray faces. He said that they were quote fairly ugly and that their faces kind of
reminded him of a frog's face. Their bodies were also unusual. The right side of their chest appeared to be swollen
out larger than the left, giving them a sort of lopsided asymmetrical appearance, and their right arms looked
longer than their left arms. He said their gray clothes were tight fitting except for a heavier section below the
waist. So he's staring at them for a full minute or more and became even more
curious. So he walked to the front of his car and stared in absolute wonder.
He said he was more amazed than afraid. But as he reached the front of the car, the three humanoids moved a little
closer to him with a movement that he said was both quote peculiar and
graceful. He said he felt as if quote they were motioning me not to come any
closer. So he stared at them for another few minutes. Then suddenly, he's not
sure how this happened. The next thing he knew, he was back in his car driving to the Loveland Police Station just a
few miles away. Now in his car, he smelled an unusual and very powerful odor which he
described as a mixture of quote fresh cut alalfa with a slight trace of
almonds. So he drives straight to the Loveland Police Department and reports his experience to police chief John K.
Fritz. Now Robert, according to Sergeant Fritz,
he said he quote looked as if he'd seen a ghost. Robert explained to him how he
had seen these little men alongside the road and that they had quote fire coming out of their hands. This is what
Sergeant Fritz said. He also complained to him of a terrible odor. Now, here's
where it gets interesting because earlier that same evening at 7:48,
Chief Fritz had actually received UFO reports in the area coming from
Charlotte White Cotton who herself was a member of the ground observer corps, a trained observer. She along with another
observer reported seeing four flying saucers from their GOC post on Lebanon
Road in Loveland. Mind you, this is a mile or two at most from where Robert
Honeyut had his humanoid sighting. And per Charlotte White Cotton, these craft
were so low that they feared for their safety and actually fled their enclosure. And reportedly, the Air Force
scrambled a jet to intercept these objects. Now, Chief Fritz knew Robert Honeyut
personally, and he could see that this man was frightened and sincere. So he told him to go home. And he got in his
cruiser and searched the area, but did not see anything. But it wouldn't be
long before other people in this area began to report seeing strange creatures. It was one evening in July of
1955, very close to this time, Emily Magnon and her husband were in their
home in Loveland Heights. This is about three miles maybe from the location of Robert Honeyut's encounter. and they
said they were awakened by their dog who was barking outside and quote setting up a terrible fuss. So they looked out
their window and they didn't see anything. But they did smell an extremely strong and penetrating odor
which they said was quote like a swamp. In fact, it was so powerful that
although it was a hot night, they closed the window to keep the smell out. Meanwhile, their dog continued to bark,
and this very powerful smell still permeated their home. Now, the next
morning, they learned that their neighbors, a married couple, had also heard the dog barking. So, the wife got
up and stepped out onto the back porch. And to her amazement, only about 15 feet
away from her, she saw a quote little man. She said he appeared to be about
three feet tall and looked to her like it was covered with twigs and foliage.
So she stepped back inside to turn on the porch light to get a better view. And looking outside, this creature was
gone. So she turned the light off, and this strange little being appeared
again, standing immobile in the same exact spot. She turned on the light a
second time, looked back, and this creature was gone again. And in fact, she did this a few more times, each time
with the same result. When the light was on, this creature would disappear, but
when the light was turned off, it would apparently come back. Very strange. Now,
a third little man report in Loveland also occurred one evening in July of
1955. The witnesses in this case, a Loveland auxiliary police officer by the name of
Carlos Flanigan, age 19. He was also initially anominous, but we do now know
his real name. Now, by coincidence, he worked also with police chief John K.
Fritz. And on the evening in question, Carlos was driving a civil defense truck
over a bridge spanning the little Miami River. And as he did, he noticed four
small figures on the riverbank beneath the bridge. Now, he said that these little humanoids were quote more or less
humanlooking little men about three feet high. But he said that they had been quote moving about oddly. He said they
were huddled in a group. They both had an odd appearance and an odd behavior.
Now, he also noticed a terrible odor. He said that he saw them only for a matter of seconds, maybe 10 seconds or so. He
rushed back to the police station. By chance, officer Fritz was not there that
night and Carlos was met with nothing but laughter from his co-workers.
There are few details about what he saw because per Carlos, he made a report to the newspapers and was mercilessly
ridiculed and he says he ended up being forced to quit his job. Now per Chief
Fritz, Carlos Flanigan had asked him for a higher position which Fritz denied for
lack of experience and says that Carlos resigned his position. Now per Leonard
Stringfield who did research this case, he heard that there was an armed guard
placed at the bridge and that the government also showed interest and investigated this incident. As he says,
this is Leonard Stringfield. I did learn from a member of the school board of that community that the incident had
been investigated by the FBI. Now, he also said that Lovelin had more than just a few UFO reports in 1955. As
Leonard Stringfield writes, just north of the city in the town of Loveland,
members of the GOC were reporting a heavy concentration of UFOs to the
Columbus Air Filter Center. Strange brilliant objects were frequently cited
hovering low over the residential sections. And on one occasion, a lone metallic disc was seen during daylight
hours hovering not far from the GOC observation tower. So this is quite a
lot going on here. And consider this report from a Loveland resident by the
name of Carol No, who contacted APRO. She says that she was 9 or 10 years old
and that in 1954 or 1955, which would be when all of this was going on, one
summer evening, she and her cousin Freddy, age 12 or 13, were sitting on
the porch of their Lovelin home when they saw a quote bright star. This was
obviously up in the sky, but it clearly wasn't a star because it was moving. They said it was not only unusually
bright, it was an aqua green blue color, as Carol says. Then it abruptly changed
directions. By this time, Freddy and I were curious beyond cautious and ran up
the road following the object, so they could see now that it had a round appearance. They eventually lost sight
of it and ran home and told her parents that they had seen a flying saucer.
Sadly, they were met with laughter and teasing. Another witness is Ted Ogden, who says that sometime in the early
1960s, his young son came running into their home in Loveland and said, "Dad, there's
a flying saucer outside." They ran outside and sure enough, there was a flying saucer, kind of. Actually, it was
a silver cigar- shaped object, which Ted estimates was about 7 feet long, maybe 2
feet wide, traveling silently and slowly overhead. So, Loveland is the town that
just keeps on giving. Get this case. 1:00 a.m. March 3rd, 1972,
Officer Ray Shocki was driving slowly along the icy Riverside road towards
Loveland when he saw what he first thought was a dog. So he stopped his car and looked at this dog, what he thought
was a dog, in his headlights. And to his shock, this dog wasn't a dog, but
instead a humanoid of some kind. He says it stood up, its eyes were shining from the car headlights. He said it was about
4 feet tall with leathery skin and a face that looked more froglike or lizard-like than human. He said it
looked at him for a few seconds, then turned and leaped over the guardrail, sliding into the little Miami River. So,
he fled the scene and returned with his fellow officer, Mark Matthews. But of course, by this time, this creature,
whatever it was, was gone. They said they saw evidence of something scraping
along the embankment into the river. Now, two weeks later, while driving along this same stretch of road, officer
Mark Matthews said he saw something lying on the road. He stopped his cruiser and opened the door and
apparently hearing the door opening. This creature in the road jumped up, assumed a defensive crouched position,
and keeping its gaze fixed on the officer, showing a kind of smirk on its face. It half walked, half hobbled to
the guardrail and disappeared over the guardrail and was gone. Now, both these officers initially insisted upon
anonymity and both agreed that the drawing made by investigators, which you can see here, was accurate. And Mark
Matthews told them, the researchers, quote, I wish this had never happened.
Now, years later, Officer Mark Matthews backpedled this entire story, said it
was all a hoax, and that what he had actually seen was an iguana missing its
tail, and that he had actually shot it and put it the body in his trunk. That's
what he says. It's kind of strange that these two police officers would risk their careers to perpetrate such a
detailed hoax and maintain it for so long. And I would mention it they said it was 20° that night which is a bit
cold for an iguana. But at that time they were by all accounts serious about
what they had seen. So I don't know. You can make up your own mind about it. They were the witnesses. They know best what
happened. And it doesn't negate the many other reports of humanoids in this area and of course the accompanying UFO
sightings. And there are more. Consider this very interesting Loveland case from
Muon Field investigator Connie McNichols. A man by the name of Terry was driving
with his friend on Butterworth Road off State Route 48 at 9:40 p.m. on February
17, 2008. And as he drove, his car engine slowly
lost power and died. So he got out of the car and checked under the hood. And
this is when he heard a strange rustling noise in the nearby cornfield. And
looking in that direction, he saw a quote massive dull light rising up out
of the cornfield. Now his friend back in the car was terrified. She remained in the car, but Terry said that this light
was actually an object about 10 to 15 feet wide, 10 ft high with a kind of
quote faded black color. said it had many smaller lights in the front. He
said it hovered, made a soft humming sound, and then it approached him, hovering only about 15 feet overhead.
And he could now see that on the bottom side of this craft were about a dozen lines of light, like quote neon fiber
optic cables. That's how he described them. He said they glowed and changed colors from white to yellow to orange
and red. The craft itself now appeared to have a deep blue color which he said
shimmerred almost like water. He could feel a tingling sensation permeating his
entire body and he said the hairs on his body quote stood on end. Now this object
hovered for a few minutes then tilted at an angle. It became completely quiet and
shot off like a dart turning bright red. He said it stopped again in the distance, zigzagged, stopped again, made
a series of loop-de-loop maneuvers before finally disappearing off to the east in a flash. The entire encounter
lasted 20 minutes. He returned to his car, which started normally. His friend
remained frightened. She does not want to talk about it. But Terry himself has
a 13-year military background, and as he says, I cannot explain it. I'm still
dumbfounded. Yet, I feel a sense of awe and a serious sense of underachievement.
I was never scared, more shocked at what I was witnessing. It truly was a spectacular moment in my life. And I
don't care if people believe me or not, but someone needs to know. There you go.
That's about all I could find out in terms of UFO activity in Loveland.
Really not sure what to make of the police officer case and the so-called frog man. I don't know. Perhaps it is,
as they say, a frank or a hoax, a strange thing for police officers to do
and to maintain for so many years. But I leave it to you to decide. I think some
of those cases are absolutely legitimate. Leonard Stringfield is a fantastic researcher. He's very highly
respected. And with so much UFO activity going on there, uh, in some cases going
on at that exact moment that Robert Honeyut had his encounter, I think we
can count that one as pretty credible. So, let's move on to the next case,
which I call something horrible was out there. This is a really interesting,
well, series of cases really. The first occurring on November 13, 1967 in
Suriri, United Kingdom. And super interesting
because uh these cases do involve humanoids and there's no overt UFO
connection, meaning the witnesses themselves didn't see UFOs, but people
saw them in the surrounding area. So I entirely possible these were ETSs given
the description of these humanoids that these people saw. So yeah, this I think
is a really interesting series of events. This case comes from pioneering researcher Charles Bowen, author of the
humanoids, which is actually one of the first books to cover humanoid cases. It
was a half hour after midnight on November 13, a damp, cloudy night, as
the witness, Philip Freeman, aged 22, and the other witness, his friend Angela
Carter, age 20, were driving along a country road through the Winterfold
Forest. This is just a few miles north of Cranley, and they were heading towards Pitch Hill and eventually to
their home in Woking. This is in the UK. So he stopped the car to wipe the
windshield of the dampness. And this is when both he and Angela became aware of
an awful revolting smell. He kind of compared it to burned food. So he
returned to the car and started talking about this awful odor. And this is when he was shocked and alarmed to see a
weird face very close up to Angela's side of the car. This face had no
features that he could see, but was just pure white. He saw that one of its arms was raised up to touch the hood of the
car. And when he saw all this, he says he felt a wave of coldness and fear.
Now, Angela was looking at him at the time, and she saw his face. She was too scared to turn around and look outside.
As she said, I knew by the look on Philip's face and by my own feeling that
something horrible was out there. So, Angela began to plead with Philillip to drive away. Now, this car was a stick
shift, and it took a moment to get the car in gear, and by this time, the figure had moved to the back window, and
Philip could now see that it had a dark cloaked body, and that it was about 4 and 1/2 ft tall. Philip drove off,
stopped the car a few hundred yards up the road. Now the smell, which had been stronger inside the car than outside,
now dissipated, and Philip asked Angela if she wouldn't mind turning around and going back to investigate. Angela, no
surprise, would not hear of it and told him to keep driving to their home in woking as quickly as possible, which
they did. Philip shared his experience with his family and friends and was met
with skepticism and teasing. Though his parents did admit to researchers that Philip was truly frightened. And it
turns out this area does have quite an interesting history of strange phenomena. In fact, one man described a
sighting way back in the 1920s along Red Road in Woking and said that he was
followed by a light. Another apparent humanoid sighting occurred one night in January or February of 1968.
A young man, Peter and his girlfriend had parked their car between Woking and
Gildenford in Siri when he got an uneasy feeling and he looked up and this is
when he saw a quote shadow behind some trees. He couldn't see it clearly, so he
started to get out of his car to look, and he watched this shadowy figure glide
closer to him, approaching about 20 ft away, and he could now see that it was
about 4 and 1/2 ft tall, not human, he said. It was too quote squat and square
to be human, not to mention the fact that it moved in perfect silence. And
like the being seen by Philillip, he couldn't see any legs. So they drove off
quickly and reportedly two weeks later they went to the same area and smelled
also a terrible odor which Peter described as quote seaweed rotting in
the hot sun. So there does appear to be something going on here. In September of 1973,
a four-year-old boy in Kingfield, Woking in Suriri, told his parents that he saw
a sixfingered headless humanoid figure wearing dark gray clothing and a belt at
the foot of his bed. It seemed to be holding something like a radio in its hand. It quickly vanished, and looking
to his doorway, he saw six similar figures who also promptly vanished. He
jumped out of bed and rushed to the window. And this is when he said he saw a domed disc with square port holes
landed on the lawn outside his home. In fact, he saw that these entities that he
had seen in his room were now climbing up a ladder inside this craft. So, he
ran to get his mother. But when they returned to the window, this object was gone. Now, just two months later, on
November 2nd, 1973, a Mrs. Rufignac was driving near Chabam
when she said she saw a rectangular-shaped object that had many flashing colored lights and was moving
silently. Get this, only about 30 ft above the ground. Lots going on here.
Here are a couple of more cases. In February of 1978, Miss Lynn Price was in
Churchy, just a bit to the north, when she and two others saw a long glowing
object flying at very low elevation and two or three times the speed of a normal
aircraft. And as she says, my friend and I are very down to earth people, and we
really don't know what to make of it. One of the men with her is a pilot and he said, quote, "Was definitely not an
airplane." Months later, in October of 1978, five separate groups of police officers
reported seeing up to seven multicolored UFOs in this same area. And in January
of 1984, there was another wave of sightings over Woking. There were at least four witnesses. one who said he
saw something over Woodham Lane, a red light which he said was quote much
larger than an aircraft. And I braced myself for the sound of a crash, but nothing happened. Another witness said
she saw quote three bright lights in a perfect triangle hovering over the Manor
Farm estate at Biffle. That is quite a few humanoid encounters in one particular place over a pretty short
period of time. Here's an interesting tidbit. Woking in the UK is actually the
location for HG Wells War of the Worlds. So make of that what you will, but
certainly an interesting fact. And again, just goes to show that these humanoid cases are pretty much
everywhere. And I've said it before, but it bears repeating. So few people report
their encounters. The stranger the encounter, the less likely a person is to report it. So kudos to all who have
the strength and courage to come forward and share what they've experienced because you can bet other people are
experiencing it too. So now let's move to the next case. This one was really
gripping, very unusual. I hadn't heard it before, but I thought it was an important case. That's why I wanted to
include it in this compilation. I call this one I was glued to the ground. This
took place on July 22nd, 1968 in Mendoza, Argentina.
And it's a really interesting single witness case, but it turns out other people did see activity in that exact
area at that time. So, I guess technically it's not a single witness case. Single witness in terms of one
person seeing humanoids. But what's also interesting is not only did people see UFOs on that same night, other people
were seeing humanoids in this area around that time. And in fact, 1968 was
a huge wave of activity for Argentina. So, I'm going to be covering some of those cases as well, but I think you'll
find this particular case involving a nurse really compelling. It's such an
unusual case. does have physiological effects and landing traces as well. This
amazing case was widely published in newspapers in England Flying Saucer
Review and France's publication Lumiere Don Lanui and many other publications.
The witness is a 45year-old nurse by the name of Adella Casalvieri de Panaceti.
It was 1:20 a.m. on July 22nd, 1968, and Adella was on night duty at the Carlos
Pereira Neurossychiatric Hospital located at 2837
It Zeno Street in Mendoza, Argentina. You can see it here. She was in the main
office preparing medication for the patients when a strange noise enveloped her. And I'll just quote her directly.
As Adella says, "I heard a loud noise, a loud buzzing sound that deafened me, and
I went out into the courtyard because I thought the gas from the stove was bothering me. So I went out to the
patio. I thought the noise would go away. When I went out into the courtyard, they, meaning the UFO, shown
a beam of light on me, and after that, I heard no more noise. Then I put my hands
to my face. I wanted to take them off to see what it was, but I couldn't because they were aiming so hard that I
couldn't. The noise was deafening enough to hurt your ears. Now, all Adella knew was that some kind of vehicle had
apparently landed about, she estimates, 60 ft away and was shining an intensely
brilliant beam of red light on her, which was causing this terrible noise and radiating a powerful heat. She
wanted to move, but as she says, I was paralyzed from the ground up. I couldn't
move. I felt like I was glued to the ground. She said the light from this object was so bright it lit up the
entire courtyard and building and the heat from the beam was very intense. As
she says, like when the sun is hot or when you pass next to a boiler.
After just a few moments, this beam retracted. The deafening sound stopped
and looking towards the source of the beam, she saw this object rising up from the ground slowly and vertically from
the center of this very large hospital courtyard. She could now see that it was a shiny silver metallic craft shaped
kind of like a hat, she said, several meters wide and glowing very brightly.
She said the bottom section revolved rapidly. The upper section had a dome which was covered with colored lights.
And she also saw several small squarish windows on the craft. And looking
through these windows, she saw people as Adela says was going away, rising very
slowly. Then I saw people moving inside the object. There were a few figures
moving around. The people inside weren't clearly visible. I saw through the
windows that some were going this way and others that way. It wasn't clear because it was quite far away, but the
people inside were clearly visible. Their heads weren't visible, just half their bodies. But I saw these people
inside walking. There wasn't just one, but several. Some walking this way and others that way inside.
So, as this object rose, this deafening sound returned. And after rising above
the brick walls surrounding the courtyard, this object zoomed away at high speed. Adella screamed for help and
started to run back into the hospital, but her legs gave away. She collapsed to her knees. She now detected a strong
smell of sulfur in the air. Her co-workers were in a ward in the
hospital at the time of this incident. They didn't hear this object or see any lights, but they did hear her screaming,
and they arrived to help her. They also noticed this very strong odor of sulfur
which seemed to be coming from a stain or a mark on the courtyard exactly where this craft had landed. Now the evidence
of this remained there and in fact the plants next to the landing site were burned. A pepper tree was burned all the
way to the ground and Adella herself suffered from first-degree burns on her
hands, her face, her neck and she says the whole right side of her body. Also,
her wool hat was also burned. She was taken to the hospital and found to be
okay. She was also taken for psychological testing and found to be normal and healthy. her. Adella, an Air
Force doctor, came to examine her and he told her that her rings and her watch,
which had stopped at precisely 1:30, all tested positive for radioactivity.
Also, the landing site tested positive for radioactivity. This stained mark remained for about 2
days. And another detail, when the courtyard was sprayed with water, it
would dry more quickly exactly where the craft had landed. Reportedly, military officials took samples of the cement and
the burned tree branches for analysis. This analysis was never released to the public. But here's another strange
thing. On that night of the encounter, before the encounter happened, the
patients in the hospital were unusually quiet and well behaved. Remember this is a psychiatric hospital and per Adela
there is usually quarreling and shouting and people getting up to walk around or get water. But the night of that
encounter she said quote the block was in perfect silence. The discipline was
perfect. Prior to the incident Adella didn't believe in UFOs but afterwards she said yes now I believe. And later an
additional possible witness was found. The night watchman at the nearby hotel on Santiago del Eststerero Street said
that he saw this object land and then take off shortly later. And reportedly
the daughters of Commander Victoria at a nearby Garrison Casino said that on the
same night they saw a luminous egg-shaped object emitting red, blue, and orange colored lights moving rapidly
across the sky. So, as it turns out, Adele's encounter was not an isolated event.
Some 400 miles away and 4 days later in Olivaria, Argentina, another startling
encounter involving humanoids occurred. This one was about 2:00 a.m. on July 25.
A police corporal heard a loud droning noise and he saw a bright luminosity. This is by the Topal stream. You can see
it here. He was about to change guard, but instead he rushed back to the station. A police officer there
authorized an investigation and the corporal returned with four other officers. They were given a jeep and an
automatic gun and they drove to this spot where he had seen the craft. And when they arrived, they were astonished
to see a large oval object emitting multicolored lights only a few meters
above the ground and it was darting around a little bit. As they watched, it moved at incredible speed, turned
sideways, and then landed behind some bushes, behind a runway used by military planes. At this point, this brilliant
craft dimmed in luminosity. This loud droning sound lessened to a soft hum,
and looking beside this desk, the officers could now see three strange beings, each about 6 ft high, wearing
silvercoled uniforms. And these beings began to slowly advance towards the
officers. Now this frightened the officers and one of them, Corporal Menendez,
took the gun and fired a volley of bullets. The strange beings immediately lifted their hands, revealing a small
glowing sphere, and immediately all the officers were overcome by a powerful feeling of tiredness that they said
rendered them incapable of using their guns. The three beings returned to the disc. It rose upwards, zigzagged a few
times, and darted off at high speed. Immediately, the officers recovered and returned to their station to report this
incident. Now, on that same day, at 5:30 a.m. July 25, her researcher, Roberto
Banks, a gentleman by the name of Oscar Augustine Denophria,
was traveling along Route 3 near the city of General Alvier. This is in Buenus Ares, Argentina. He was at the 37
km mark when he says about 300 ft off the road, he noticed an increasing
luminosity. His car engine failed. He was unable to move and he could now see
that this light was actually a craft of some kind which appeared to be emitting sparks. He saw two figures nearby, but
they were too far away to see any real detail. He did see them return into the craft which took off and darted away at
which point his car started working again. And that same day another gentleman in La Pastor, Argentina said
that he saw a silvery spinning top-shaped object hovering near the
road. Again, his car failed. The object rose upward and moved off and his car
restarted. A lot was going on. It was about two weeks after that on August 9,
1968 that UFOs returned to the city of Mendoza. Police officer Arcenio Romero
from the fifth precinct in Mendoza was six miles away from where Adella had her
encounter. This is at the zoo in Sero de Lag Gloria. Suddenly, the zoo animals
and dogs were acting up, and he sat about 200 feet away from him, he saw a brilliantly lit craft. As Arseno says,
it was like a flying saucer with a part in the middle that looked like it was made of glass resting on three little
legs. Flashes of different colors came out of it, spinning around intermittently.
First, they were blue, yellowish on the edge. They were bluish, bluish green.
These lights were very bright, stronger than the sun, although metallic in appearance. He said the object was kind
of shaped like a child's top, but had a transparent dome on top. As our senior
says in his own words, "I got closer out of curiosity. When I got there, I saw
these people coming out bellowing as they left the platform. It was a loud buzzing sound, almost a bellow,
difficult to compare. It was dry, harsh, a loud, high-pitched whistling sound that made my ears hurt. The lights also
bothered me, but they didn't blind me. Although, as I got closer, a sulfurous smell became more noticeable, causing me
distress. These beings were surrounding the saucer. They didn't touch the ground. Now, per Arsenio, these beings
had tall, elongated heads, and it looked to him like they were rotating around the craft. So he pulls out his gun at
which point he became completely paralyzed. He says, "I tried to walk
forward, backward, but I couldn't. I tried to move my arms, but I couldn't. I
couldn't scream or speak either, and I felt a burning sensation on my body in front of me, and I fell to the ground."
Erin, he when he fell to the ground, it was because a blue violet beam was shown on
him from this UFO or these beings. He fell paralyzed to the ground and passed out. He was found later by a stranger,
woken up and rushed to a nearby hospital where he says he remained for 4 days suffering from nervous upset and pain in
his shoulders, elbows, and knees. Now, reportedly landing traces were found at the site. You can see the photograph
here. Arcenio speculates that the ETSs were coming to gather uranium as the
area of Mendoza is known to have rich uranium deposits. Few more encounters.
The same day as Adela Calvier's encounter at 2 p.m. July 22nd, 1968,
this is 12 hours after her encounter. Pilots, police officers, and airport
personnel at the San Carlos de Berilo airport near Bajia Blanca were puzzled
by the appearance of a quote excessively long plane. They said it had swept back
short delta-like wings which were far far too short to support a craft of its
enormous size. began circling the airport runway at about 200 feet
altitude as if searching for a place to land. But the problem was the plane made
no radio contact and was also making very bizarre maneuvers. Per the
witnesses, it was somewhat similar to a Canbera jet, but it had no windows. It
did have black squares or what looked like black squares painted on its side. And although many people viewed it
through binoculars, nobody could identify this aircraft. And despite its large size, it glided about with obvious
grace and ease and very little engine noise. And right when it looked like it was about to land, it sped away at high
speed. Now, more reports could be cited. There's a lot of them, so I'll just quote a few. June 29, four people in San
Louise del Palmer saw an object which went over their car, shaking it
violently and actually making it go backwards. July 2nd, five people in
Sierra Chica, Buenus Arez, saw a UFO zigzagging across the sky when it zoomed
straight towards them and flew a few meters over their heads, causing them all to throw themselves to the ground,
shut up, and darted away. July 7, a man in Questa Das Vakas in San Juan was
driving with his family when they said a 90 foot long craft moved right across
the road in front of them only 3 ft above the road. July 16, five police
officers saw a 6- foot wide glowing blue craft which caused their Jeep to lose power. July 18, again in Mendoza, mind
you this is just 4 days before Adella's encounter. Four teachers were driving
when they encountered a red orange oval object 60 ft long traveling just above
the ground. They said it emitted an odor like damp paper which became so strong
that they had trouble breathing and one witness suffered extreme sleepiness.
One more. September 12 in series Santa Fe, Argentina. A small glowing red oval
object was so low per the witnesses, it was skimming just above the houses in the area. I could go on. As you can see,
this is a very intense wave. How amazing is that? All that activity going on in
the summer of 1968 in Mendoza, Argentina, and of course the surrounding
areas of really intense wave of UFO activity. That case at the hospital is
particularly compelling, but I do think we need to consider the possibility that that was in fact humans inside a reverse
engineered craft. We really do need to consider all possibilities when looking
at these cases. I think some of the cases are clearly ET given the description of these very unusual
looking humanoids. But I'm just presenting the facts as we know them. You can make up your own minds about it.
But now let's move to the next case which is really interesting and undeniable really. I call this one ETS
at the electrical station. This occurred on July 23rd, 1968 around the same time
as this wave in Argentina. This occurred in Boru, Brazil. It's a fascinating case
because of its location at this electrical station. As you may know, ETSs do show an interest in nuclear
power stations, hydroelect electric dams, really any kind of technological installation. So, that could be a factor
here. Of course, if you take a look at this case, it might be humans as well
inside of a reverse engineered craft, but whatever the explanation, it's
certainly an interesting event. This case comes from respected researcher Dr. Walter K. Buler and was published in the
Brazilian publication the SBedV bulletin but it also appeared in numerous
newspapers and in the APRO bulletin. It was 1:00 am on July 23rd, 1968.
By coincidence, a day after Adela Calalvier's encounter in Mendoza that
night, watchman Daleo de Oliviveria was on duty at the Central Electric Power
Station located in Boro, Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was a new employee, had only
been working there for 15 days. and he was making his routine rounds when he noticed a figure standing in a dimly lit
area near the entrance. And as he quietly approached, hoping not to be noticed, he heard a noise and saw
another figure who he saw was wearing dark clothes peeking out from one of the
windows of the little office there. Now realizing that these were men, trespassers, he grabbed a rod of iron
and walked up to one of the figures quietly, who he assumed had its back to him. And three feet away from this
figure, he swung the rod at this being and was surprised when this figure swiftly evaded him. And only then did he
realize that this figure did not have his back to him, but was facing him wearing some kind of helmet. He said it
wasn't quote a normal person. It was wearing an opaque helmet. Now, instead
of talking, this figure made loud grunting sounds and physically grabbed the witness and wrestled him to the
ground. Now, as Dale do fought the man, the second figure came running and
joined the fry. Mind you, the witness is young and strong, and he continued fighting these two figures for about 10
minutes when a third figure appeared. Now, this figure looked different. He had light colored coveralls, very pale
skin, red hair, which per DLO was different and harder in texture than normal hair. This third figure grabbed
the witness, pulled him to his feet. This caused the witness to lose his shoes in the struggle. This man tore his
clothes, struck his leg, causing Dale Do. And the three men basically ganged up on
him, picked him up, and threw him to the ground. he says five or six times until
he stopped resisting. Now defeated, the witness lay still. The figures poked him
gently in the ribs a couple of times, apparently to make sure he was all right. That was his impression. And then
the red-headed man pulled him up to his feet, patted his back in a friendly way,
and communicated to him in some way to go away. Our fight here is over. Now,
per the witness, he now heard this red-headed figure speaking in an unintelligible language, and all three
of these figures started to walk off. The witness, Dale, Doe, walked cautiously away towards the nearby
stairwell, and began to shout for help. And looking back, he saw that these
three men were approaching a small gray craft about 30 ft wide, 45 ft high,
which he said was shaped much like a Volkswagen van. They entered inside it and this craft emitted a noise and rose
upwards at an angle causing a blast of cold air. It maneuvered next to a nearby
electrical transformer causing it to throw off some sparks. Then it zigzagged
briefly shot upwards quickly into the sky and was gone. Now seeing this,
Daleo, the witness, was now convinced that he had just encountered extraterrestrials. He ran to find
Antonio, the security guard for the next shift. And together they searched the area. They found Delo's torn clothing,
his buttons, his shoes, his flashlights, several of the footprints from the men.
They saw that one of the office doors had been apparently forced open. They of
course notified authorities and this led to a thorough investigation. An inspection of the office that had been
broken into showed that nothing was missing, but they did find strange handprints on the file cabinet inside
the office. News of this incident soon leaked out and reporters came to interview the witness. Reportedly, the
military took over the investigation, which was carried out in secret, and the results, of course, were never released
to the public. The only real result of this incident was that the electric station personnel doubled the number of
guards protecting this electric plant. That case is definitely a bit of an
outlier. I don't know that I've heard any quite like it in terms of how the
ETSs, well, alleged ETSs were behaving, humanoids,
uh, the description of the craft and so forth. It's an unusual event, but I do
wonder if perhaps that was humans in a reverse engineered craft. I'm just
saying this again because we can't be too careful. All right, now let's move to the next
case, which I think is absolutely ET given what the witness describes. I call
this one, it scared the hell out of me. This occurred on in July 19, 1972
in Pioneer Township, Michigan. This is largely a single witness case, though
later the witness did have further encounters, including one with his mother. But this is a really unusual
face-to-face encounter with a gray ET that has some particularly interesting elements to it. So, that's why I wanted
to share it with you today. The witness in this case is an anonymous young man at the time of his encounter and he
reported it later to Mufon writing, "I swear these events happened and I would
not hesitate to take a lie detector test." He said it was around dusk July
19, 1972 and he was playing basketball by himself in the upper hoft of the barn
next to his home in Pioneer Township, Michigan. He had just taken a shot with
the basketball and this is when he noticed something in the lower halft. As he says, I can only describe it as a
tremendous amount of concentrated energy. At that moment, I could visibly see nothing, but I knew something was
there. As I continued looking at that spot, a ball of pulsating light appeared
about the size of a softball, or maybe a little larger. My mind was trying to figure out what I was looking at. So he
stepped to the right and he could see that whatever this thing was, it was definitely sitting in the air there
pulsating. So he just stood there and stared at it as his mind scrambled to find an explanation for what he was
seeing. And this is when suddenly the ball of energy expanded vertically and
outstepped a humanoid creature. As the witness says, I found myself facing a
being with very large black eyes, a tiny nose, a slit for a mouth, very small,
flat ears, and very long fingers, three on each hand. I would say its height was
less than four feet. It appeared to be very light complexed. It scared the hell out of me, and I could feel some kind of
energy hitting me in the lower forehead, as if it was trying to communicate or observe me. I was aware it was moving
closer to me and I ran. So he stormed into the house and told his mother that he had just seen a ghost because at the
time he had never heard of gray ETS. He didn't know how else to explain it. But
events weren't over yet. A short time later he and his mother were driving and
came upon quote an orange ball of light sitting in the air. As they approached
it, it suddenly disappeared, but neither of them were able to identify it. It was
only two years later in 1974 that the witness had another sighting. He said he
was outside his home when a huge black triangular-shaped object with three
lights at each apex and a panel of lights on the back stopped directly over his head. As he says, this ship was
easily 400 ft long. It sat above me for at least 10 minutes. I don't believe it
could have been more than 100 ft off the ground. When this craft started to move, the large corner lights went to blue,
green, and red. The rear lights flipped on in sequence, left to right. It moved
away in a very slow northeast direction with no sound or air movement. So, these
events still remain vivid in his mind 39 years later when he reported it to the
Mutual UFO Network. Can you imagine not reporting an event for some 39 years,
then finally finding the courage to come forward? This is a pattern I see with so many witnesses. It takes a lot to
process these kinds of events. Often people are alone with them. They can't even share it with their family or
friends because who wants to be ridiculed? Who wants to be gaslit because of an experience they had? It's
really unfair. I blame our own governments, secret governments. This cover up is no joke. It's been very
effective in silencing witnesses. Thankfully, that is changing and a lot more people are coming forward. This is
such an important subject. We all deserve to know the truth. I know you guys know this. But this is why I do
this research because so many people are having these experiences and many of them have no support system, no
recourse, no place to get really good information on this subject. All right,
let's move to the next case which I call this creature was not human. This took
place on November 10, 1986 in a very rural area of Clovis, California. I like
this case because this witness describes her experience in very vivid detail.
She's clearly quite intelligent. It's a really poignant encounter actually, and
I think you'll find it really compelling. This firsthand eyewitness testimony comes from Sarah, that is a
pseudonym. Her parents owned a 20 acre ranch property on the outskirts of
Clovis. This was near the intersection of Bullard and North Academy Avenue. You
can see it here. Sarah was 20 years old at the time of her encounter. was the
night of November 10, 1986 when she stepped out onto the back porch
facing north and noticed a strange blue white light towards the nearby Friant
Karn Canal which bordered her parents' property. Now, she thought briefly it
might be headlights on a car, but they clearly weren't that. They were too blue. Didn't look like campers either.
And as Sarah says, they were very pretty. The light was large and glowed outwards and filled the sky in the shape
of a dome. So, she was very curious about this because nobody ever went out to that area. And she decided that the
next morning she would hike over there and investigate. But strangely, when morning came, she completely forgot
about it. That night, the lights were back. And as Sarah says, same color,
same spot. I told myself that for sure I would head out in the morning and
investigate. So, the next morning after watching the Price is Right with her grandmother, it was around 11:00 a.m.
she grabbed her rifle, which she normally used for rabbit hunting, got her golden retriever, Sheena, and headed
towards the canal runoff where she had seen these lights. Took her about 10 minutes to hike there. And as she
stepped over a barbed wire fence marking the property line, something very strange happened. As Sarah says, that's
when a fear hit me. It hit me out of nowhere. I found myself instantly scared. I have never been scared out
there, especially with a rifle in my hand. The hair on my neck stood up, my shoulders raised, and my head sunk into
my neck. I looked left, then right, then all around me. Something inside of me
was telling me to run. But Sarah bravely screwed up her courage, put her finger on the trigger of her 22 LR rifle, and
walked the remaining 60 feet of the canal runoff as quickly as she could without running. And finding nothing,
she headed back towards her property. The feeling of danger was still there,
and she had the urge to keep walking, but for some reason, she says she stopped. And this is when she realized
that her dog Sheena, who would never normally abandon her, was suddenly gone.
Sarah looked around her, and this is when her life changed forever. As Sarah says, he didn't want to look behind me
for some reason. When I reluctantly looked behind me, I instantly spotted what I thought was a small child. Down
near the opening in the dirt bank was a figure. I thought it was a boy about 8 or 9 years old. The figure was wearing
all black from feet to neck. She could now see that this figure had a huge bald
head and a thin body and not only looked strange, it was dressed strangely. And
Sarah slowly realized that this figure was not normal. As Sarah says, as I
continued to stare, the large head of this figure clearly appeared bald, and the eyes were larger than expected. Very
large. This wasn't a little boy. There was something very foreign about this thing. Something inside of me recognized
this creature as not human. Something felt wrong. At the time, Sarah had never
heard of gray aliens. But later, seeing images on television and the internet, she realized that this creature was a
typical gray. But at the time, all she knew is that this figure was not human.
And as she says that that was when this big-headed figure raised its arm and
seemed to wave at me. I wasn't sure if it was a hello or a goodbye.
Sarah looked around to see if she could see her dog Sheena, and when she looked back towards this gray, it was gone. So,
she walked home quickly and was puzzled to find that her dog Sheena was already in her dog pen. She immediately asked
her grandmother if she had put Sheena in the dog pen. And her grandmother said, "Yes, I did. Where have you been?" And
Sarah said that she had taken a walk to the runoff. And her grandmother replied, "Well, you were gone a very long time."
But Sarah protested, she said, "I was only gone for 15 minutes." But when she
went into her room to put her rifle away, she was shocked to see that it was now 1:10 p.m. She was missing almost two
hours of time. Now, at the time, this was all so confusing that she just figured her clock must be wrong. And by
the next day, she had actually completely forgot about the encounter. It wasn't until one year later when
something strange happened which brought the memory back. She was sleeping in her
bedroom when she was awakened by a brilliant blue light streaming in through her window. She wondered at
first if it could be the police, but this didn't make any sense as her window faced the back part of the house where
there was no road. And I'll just quote Sarah as she says. I turned my head and
looked to the footboard of my bed. A gray, as we now know them, was staring back at me. I noticed a huge head and
big eyes. Its forehead seemed to shine in an oily way, as if it needed
cleaning. I focused on its eyes. Its eyes opened wide as if surprised. I
wasn't scared. I was in awe. I wondered to this day if it was mimicking me or
not. Did its eyes widen as if surprised that I woke and noticed it? Or was it
mimicking my surprise that it was there? After it opened its wise wider in surprise, I apparently fell back to
sleep. Now, I've heard that same sort of mimicking thing that these grays do in
almost a playful way, and that's exactly what she's describing. The next morning, Sarah searched her room, but the gray,
of course, was gone. But the memory of this gray she saw a year earlier came back to her. And now, thinking back to
her childhood, she remembered a particularly vivid dream at age seven or
eight that she had always wondered about, and she now realized could be connected to all this. As Sarah says, I
was staring out a window looking down at a planet. I heard a voice say, "That's
your planet." The scary part was I felt like I was falling or about to fall out
the window. The planet seems so huge and so close. Why would I have this dream?
So, following these two encounters with the grays, Sarah recalls no further encounters, but does report that the
encounter affected her profoundly. As she says, everything changed. I found
myself looking up at the stars. I became interested in everything outer space. I
started to research UFOs at the library. I went to Walden Books to find anything
on abductions and aliens. I found the book by Bud Hopkins. And the cover
scared the bleep out of me. So Sarah, like many witnesses, waited 34 years
before she reported her encounter. There you go. another person who waited decades to report their encounter. And
what an amazing encounter it was. And as we've seen, it's not a singular event.
Events like these are rarely a oneoff. Most people who have face-toface contact with an ET or humanoid probably have had
other events. That's certainly true in her case. It's not always true, but it is a pattern I've certainly noticed. All
right, let's move to the next case. Here's another one you probably haven't heard before. I call this one an alien
beside my bed. This occurred on August 25, 2022 in North Carolina. It's a
particularly compelling case which I found kind of interesting having done a lot of research into UFO healings. And
this witness does report a healing of a psychological condition, presumably
psychological. Uh, well, you can make up your own mind about this case, but I did find it really compelling. The witness
in this case is anonymous. I call her Natalie. She has elected to keep both her name and her location private. We do
know that it took place somewhere in North Carolina in the middle of the night on August 25, 2022.
She had just woken up from a dream when she had her an encounter with what appears to be a gray type ET. As Natalie
says, I rolled over on my back and saw a short dark figure with a big and wide
head. Was completely cloaked in darkness so that I couldn't make out any details of its face or body was on my right side
beside the edge of my bed touching my knee. Now, there was enough light coming
from the street light outside that Natalie could clearly see that this being was not human. It stood perfectly
still. And the second she saw it, she found herself paralyzed. She couldn't talk, but she said she was able to
whisper to herself, "It's an alien. It's an alien." Weirdly, when she did this,
it sent her a telepathic image of a cell phone, which as Natalie says, I think
was trying to tell me not to be afraid in some way. I wasn't afraid, just stunned and shocked. Now, at this point,
Natalie called out twice to the name of Jesus, and she says, "This being disappeared, and as Natalie says, it
simply vanished as if it had never been there, and I could move again." Now, she did discover an amazing and very
positive after effect. As Natalie says, "I've had terrible insomnia since high
school. After this alien's visit, my lifelong insomnia was cured. Now, I have
no problems falling asleep." and that cure was permanent. She said she also
developed a strong interest in UFOs and began to study this subject. And she initially believed that this cure was
purely altruistic for her benefit. But fear crept in and she began to wonder if
perhaps that this ET was just trying to make it easier for him to take her. Cuz
she began to find evidence of this when she woke up several times to find her leggings on backwards. On one occasion,
she woke up to feel quote, "Something pointed in plastic sticking out from my gum." And one day, while brushing that
spot with her toothbrush, this suspected implant came out. And she said it looked
like a small coiled clear telephone almost with a red thread running through
it. She also noticed a strange mark on her nose that hadn't been there before. She began having problems with sleep
paralysis. One time she woke up, she says, to see a quote, a very tall, thin being which was
standing next to her husband's side of the bed. And as Natalie says, it seemed shocked and scared that I had woken up.
Natalie is not sure why she's having these experiences, but she does report that her aunt and two of her uncles have
also seen UFOs and that one of her uncles is a colonel in the Air Force.
She does report something else that she thinks is connected to all this, that she has very strong psychic abilities.
There you go. And there are several reasons why I found that case credible. She reports the ET's telepathically
communicating with her, telling her not to be afraid. She reports being healed
of insomnia. She reports a huge boost in her psychic abilities. All these details
are quite consistent with ET contact. We also found it interesting that her
family has a history of encounters. Her uncle was a colonel in the Air Force. And there's a lot of interesting details
to her case. But there you go. Seven cases from all over the world. Each a
little bit different, each similar in some ways. I think these similarities
between cases that are far-flung from each other geographically speaking and
in time argue for their credibility. These people are describing the same details yet they don't know each other.
They've never heard of each other's cases. Many of these cases are quite obscure. Um so yeah, I think that does
argue for their veracity and each case almost always has some
unique elements to it. little details that probably don't turn up in the vast
majority of cases. Hard to say for sure. There's so many of these events. I mean,
the any numbers I would say of how common this is is vastly underestimated.
I've said it two or three times already. Most people don't report their events
with extraterrestrials or face toface meetings. So we have to consider just
how common is this? Probably a lot more common than people even within the UFO
community believe. This is again such an important subject. We all deserve to know the truth. This
cover up cannot go on forever. Sooner or later, the truth is going to come out. And that's exactly what we're seeing. I
find these human cases super interesting because I do think they are the cutting
edge of UFO research. It's really telling to me that while our governments
will talk about UFO sightings or even crash retrievals, they have yet to approach the subject of people who are
having direct contact. That speaks volumes. So, there you go. Another
episode outlining several humanoid encounters. And you can bet I've got more where
those came from. So, thank you again, you guys. I truly appreciate you watching. I hope you enjoyed the show.
perhaps learned a little bit. Until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most
important of all, keep having fun. And I will see you next Friday for the next episode of UFOs and the Paranormal.
