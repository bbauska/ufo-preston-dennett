I WENT ONBOARD AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT:SIX SCARY TRUE CASES
Seeing a UFO is an incredible experience. But far more shocking is having a very close encounter with a humanoid extraterrestrial. When someone has very close face-to-face contact, there is no chance of misperception. It is an undeniable experience that instantly changes a person’s worldview. This video presents ten shocking cases of people who have had direct contact with UFO occupants. The cases span from 1923 to 2012, come from across the planet, and involve a wide variety of humanoids. These cases are supported by multiple eyewitness testimonies, radar returns, photographs, landing traces and more.

UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS. One summer morning in June 1923, ten-year-old Norman Wilson Massie went outside his home in Mount Erie, Illinois to check on the family’s horses. To his shock, he came upon a landed UFO with five little blond men, each about four feet tall. They rushed back and forth, apparently repairing their craft. After five minutes, the craft flew away. Norman told his family, but nobody else for many years.

MANY SURPRISES AWAIT TERRESTRIALS. It was a summer morning in 1945 when nine-year-old I. Chebotaryov went fishing along the shores of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov, Russia. He was about to return home when a silver craft dropped from the sky and landed in the water just off shore. A silver-suited humanoid exited and approached the witness, saying that he came from another planet, and invited the witness to come onboard.

HUMANOIDS VISIT A NAVY SHIP. In 1952, the USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt aircraft carrier had the first of what would be ten separate visitations by UFOs. This first encounter involved a metallic disk, as did a second and third encounter in 1956. In 1958, Navy officer Chester Grusinski was on deck when another craft appeared, and through the portholes he and many others saw alien figures looking down at them. The event was covered up as were the previous and future encounters.

THE DOCTOR AND THE ALIEN. On August 26, 1966, Dr. Juan Jose Rivera was driving his motorbike near Punta Carnero, Spain when he saw a monkey-like figure wearing a jumpsuit float across the road ahead of him. He chased it down a hill to a landed flying saucer. He snapped one quick photograph before fleeing the scene in panic.

THE HUMANOIDS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. At 10pm on January 29, 1967, Enid Campbell looked out the window of her home in Knox City, Missouri to see a white spherical-shaped object approach her home and hover in her backyard. Looking inside, she saw two beings wearing “shiny silvery wetsuits.” She alerted her two children who also saw the craft. Afterward, they found burned vegetation in the backyard.

UFO AND HUMANOIDS LAND BY A TRAIN. On April 20, 1967, several railway employees riding past the Casalegno Station in Argentina were shocked to see a strange craft with multicolored lights and tiny three-foot-tall humanoid alongside the railroad tracks. They slowed down the train and watched in shock as these beings moved hastily around the craft. They discovered that an earlier train had also seen the UFO.

WE DID NOT LOOK BACK. At 3am on September 30, 1968, two young men were walking along a rural road near Roncenay, France when a glowing red UFO flew across the sky ahead of them. Coming around a corner, they saw that the craft had landed and two little humanoids were floating around it, shining flashlights on the ground. Then one of the humanoids approached to within 15 feet. The men fled in fear.

ROCK COLLECTING ALIENS. Around dusk one evening in 1976, nine-year-old Hercilio da Costa was walking to her home in rural San Goncalo do Amarante, Brazil when she walked right up to a landed UFO. Seven human-looking figures in dark jumpsuits stood around it. One was collecting small stones and putting them in a sac. When one of the beings spoke, Hercilio fled in fear. Later, landing traces were found.

THE FLOATING HUMANOID. At 1:30 am on December 30, 1979, Sebastiano Pannitteri woke up in his home in Sicily, Italy to his dog barking and his bedroom filling with light. Rushing to the window, he was awestruck to see a short humanoid dressed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, floating in his yard. It remained there for five minutes before gliding away and disappearing behind a wall.

TWO ALIENS ABOVE SECOND STREET. On the night of May 25, 2012, six people in two cars were traveling west on Highway 7 in Clinton, Missouri when their journey was interrupted by an unusual sight: a large craft with glowing portholes was hovering just above 2nd Street. The witnesses were frightened to see two skinny humanoids looking out the window. More sightings soon followed.

So many cases of humanoid encounters! These ten cases may be shocking, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. These kinds of events are much more common than most people know. And they have lots to tell us about what’s out there beyond Earth. Are we ready to learn?

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode is called
I went on board an extraterrestrial craft six scary true cases I love
talking about onboard UFO encounters it's probably the most extensive type of UFO encounter a person can have
certainly among the most controversial aspects of this subject and yet these
cases are not only the most interesting I think but certainly have the most potential to teach us about what's going
on here and I've got six cases that you probably haven't heard before they're not super well known they definitely
deserve to be there are a lot of cases of these kinds and the six cases I've
chosen today come from a wide variety of locations they started back in the 1960s
up to the 1990s I've got a case from Argentina case from Canada one from France one
from Hungary and two in the United States one in Alabama and one in Kansas
some of these are multiple witness cases uh there is quite a bit of evidence to support a number of these
cases as well different types of ETS and just some really extensive cases
where people did get to communicate with these ETS so let's just get started first case
I want to talk about today I call contact in Calgary again this is not a very
well-known case it occurred on November 17 1967 in a suburb in Calgary Alberta
Canada and this is a single witness case it's very interesting because while the
witness did undergo hypnosis to recall some of the details of his experience he
initially did have missing time but remembered it spontaneously through a dream and this
is what actually prompted him to undergo hypnosis it's a really fascinating and
unusual case this case comes from researcher William K Allen and was also
published in an article contact te supplies New Clues to the UFO mystery
which was written by B and slate and appeared in the April 1976 issue of UFO
report the sole witness in this case is 13-year-old David sea Walt he had gone
to visit a friend's home where the two boys did some weightlifting and then at
5:45 p.m. again on November 17 1967 David began what should have been a
3-minute walk back to his home in Calgary but of course that's not what happened as he was crossing a vacant lot
an empty field he heard a high-pitched sound coming from above and looking up
he saw a craft he said was about the size of a house hovering only maybe 30
to 40 feet overhead it was silver gray it had a band of green yellow blue orange red and
pink lights around the edge all of which seemed to be blending into each other so
this frightened him David ran and the craft began to follow him suddenly as
he's running away it shot an orange beam of light right at him it came from the bottom of the craft dazed and frightened
David continued to run straight home in fact he dashed into the front door he
was missing one of his shoes he ran upstairs and hid under his bed his sister Angela found him hiding
there and saw that his eyes were glazed and he appeared to be in shock so she shook him asked him what happened and he
told her I've been chased by a flying saucer it was now 6 :30 p.m. so there
were over 40 minutes of time that he could not account for his parents of
course heard the story and became very concerned especially because over the next few days David who was normally a
calm boy was very nervous and uneasy so his sister Angela later
retraced David's path home and she found a shoe in the middle of the road his
parents decided to find a UFO researcher and they Loc ated William K Allen who
only 3 days after David's encounter did a recorded interview with him and as
William says I taped his description of what he believed happened and that's
where the case sat for about 5 months then on April 21st
1968 David experienced a very Vivid and realistic nightmare his first dream
about this incident where he basically relived the encounter only this time he
did recall being taken on board this craft at the time he was having this
dream David was thrashing around in bed and he was woken up by his younger brother who was concerned about this and
upon Awakening David told his little brother call Dad now I know what happened when I was chased by the
UFO so this dream gave David only partial recall of being pulled on board
and seeing what he called quote monsters he recalled being being physically examined but later David did agree to
undergo hypnosis by a dental surgeon by the name of Dr Kitz who used hypnosis in
his practice so they were hoping that he could recall more of what
happened so Dr kovitz first suggested that perhaps David had concocted the
whole story as an excuse for coming home late David hostilely denied this and in
fact his mother confirmed that David had always been home on time a psychologist
by the name of Dr Manan and the researcher William K Allen also attended
this hypnosis session and under hypnosis David was taken back to the incident and
he immediately began to experience an intense fear in fact he perspired
profusely he started ringing his hands his whole body started shaking he was
unable to speak or get past the memory block finally the hypnotist suggested
that David try to remember the events as though he was watching TV this technique
worked David began to remember he recalled seeing this UFO trying to run
being struck by the beam of light and then as David says I was sort of in a
trance the beam just brought me up into the ship now inside this craft he was
immediately confronted by two he says scary looking non-human anti te with a
sort of reptilian likee appearance as David says it has scaly skin it looked
like crocodile skin sort of rough all over it has holes for its nose and holes
for its ears it has a slit on its face for a mouth it's
brown so the beings were very clinical as they undressed David placed him on a
table and began to examine him and as David says in his own words they didn't
show any expression they put me on sort of a cot he's looking at my body he's studying it
he took all my clothes off they're bringing me through a hallway into another room it has all sorts of bright
lights in it there's another table they put me on that table he's lifting my head up he looks at my hair and my eyes
and my nose they put this other thing over me it's a grayish color and they
just throw it over me and then this great big huge orange colored light
comes down and is shown on me so David could now see that there were actually
four of these beings all who looked pretty much the same each was about 6
feet tall he said that they had round heads four fingers on each hand they did
not appear to be wearing anything as far as he could tell and he said he could hear them talking in a strange language
which sounded like sort of just a buzzing noise to him he says they took a small gray instrument sort of like a
needle-like device and stuck it in his arm but he felt no pain as he says I
felt quote funny numb at this point the examination was
over the beings put his clothes back on he was taken out from the room and then
as he says quote they beamed me down in the empty lot so he's thoroughly frightened at
this point his body is still still partly numb his head is swirling and he ran home as fast as he could the
psychologist Dr Manan learned that David had earlier undergone an appendectomy
this was in fourth grade and he questioned David about it and learned that one of the doctors was old and had
wrinkled skin and developed this crazy theory that David's hypnotic recall was
really just a subconscious memory of his appendectomy now researcher William K
Allen replied in this way I can no way concur I highly doubt that this witness
had a hallucination or a fabrication of his
prior appendectomy surgery that really makes no sense whatsoever and it
certainly doesn't explain the missing time I think that's just a debunking explanation coming from a skeptic who
can't quite wrap his mind around the fact that these things do happen there are a lot of cases coming from all over
the world certainly a remarkable case and now we move to the next one which is
super interesting I call this one contact in lockley this is a somewhat
brief case but the events surrounding it are truly astonishing this case occurred
on October 17 1973 in Loxley Alabama what's
interesting about this case is that 197 73 has been termed the year of the
humanoids there was a very intense wave on that year particularly towards the
end of the year and this particular event in Loxley had events both before
and after it and really a huge number on the very same day so this brings a very
interesting aspect to this case but the case itself is it's also quite unusual
not very well known at all and I think you'll find it fascinating October 17 1973 will
probably go down in UFO history as one of the busiest days of UFO activity ever
this was just days after the very famous Pascagoula case in Alabama involving
Charlie Hixon and Calvin Parker and it was a few days before the
famous Jeff greenhaw faulkville Alabama case where the police officer Came Upon
a UFO occupant and actually photographed it so yeah October 17 something happened
that was very profound and it began on the afternoon of October 17 when two
children in watuga Tennessee said that they saw a circular copper colored craft
which hovered right above the ground they had a door open opened and a 6ot tall being with claw-like hands tried to
grab them now reportedly six other reports of UFOs came from that area
alone at that time and this is just the beginning it was a short time later at
4:40 p.m. Teddy waldrup age 7 and his friend Kevin Whitehead age n were
playing at the sa Joseph School play ground in Princeton Indiana and this is
when they saw a silvery object hovering and then taking off at high acceleration as Kevin's mother Miss
Charles Whitehead says Kevin came home in a near Panic that's how I knew it
wasn't just a little boy's joke so that's a case in Tennessee another in
Indiana all across the South here in the Midwest cases were occurring at a rapid
raid on October 17 was around Twilight that same night a man was driving along
Highway 82 near Europa Mississippi when he said he saw a UFO shaped kind of like
an inverted cup he said it was covered with green blue flashing lights and was hovering only 3 feet above the road's
surface so the man approached to about 300 ft to this craft when his headlights
went out and his car engine died he says there was another car right behind him
who also stopped at this point a second identical craft appeared about 60 ft
above the first sending down a beam of light onto the first craft and it was at
this point that he says he saw a gray scaly humanoid which he described very
strange as looking something like a catfish had a ridge on its back weird
squirrel like legs flippered feet he saw this thing emerge from the top of the
craft there's not a lot of detail on this case I definitely have some questions about it but given that
there's so many cases occurring on this night clearly something profound is happening because it was that same night
October 17 8:00 p.m. an 11-year-old girl and her cousin were making a scarecrow
for Halloween in the front yard of their home in Connorsville Indiana when they
heard a humming sound coming from above looking up they saw what they first thought was a plane until suddenly it
stopped right above them the humming sound stopped and they could now see that this was a craft a silver gray
saucer with bright lights along the bottom and they watched as it ejected three foggy looking quote things one of
these foggy looking things began to circle the field they watched this for about 3 minutes until the object moved
to the Northeast same evening two men were driving along on Route 2 3 near Wayne
New Jersey when they saw a large round silver craft hovering above a field and
then apparently land so they stopped exited their cars to watch one of these
gentlemen became scared drove off but the other reportedly remained and said
that seven human looking figures emerged from the craft four men three women and
he says he held a short conversation with them again no further information
on most to these cases but here's another it was 900 p.m. same night Paul
Brown was driving along US Route 29 near Danielsville Georgia when he says a
silver UFO dropped down and blocked the road about 300 feet ahead of him he
screeched to a stop and watched as two beings each was about 4 and 1/2 ft tall
and wearing silver suits and white gloves he said it looked like they had reddish faces and white hair but they
appeared underneath this craft now Paul grabbed his gun stepped halfway out of
his car and with his gun in hand pointed it towards them the beings immediately
turned and re-entered the craft which took off with the whooshing sound Paul says he fired several shots at the craft
with no apparent effect other than to apparently chase this craft
away more cases on this night it's crazy later that evening a woman from
Pikesville Maryland said she was woken up by a loud explosion followed by a humming noise and walking out onto her
front porch she saw a red transparent object about 15 ft long 8 ft High had
transparent bubble on top and she could see a humanoid figure standing up inside
of it and there are more reports the crew of an offshore oil platform in
proba Louisiana said that they saw an object hovering about 1,000 ft overhead
it then descended to about 100 ft which caused the platform's entire electrical
system to fail 10 other reports from poh hatan Louisiana came in of a
multicolored object which was hovering and gliding there were many other
reports but the one I really want to talk about occurred to a gentleman by
the name of Clarence Ray patteron he's a 31-year-old electrician and it was about
15 minutes before midnight October 17 he was driving along Interstate 10 this is
near lockley again lockley Alabama and he was driving along
Interstate 10 near the Loxley exit when he noticed a quote unidentified
spaceship he said it was cigar shaped had a green green light was hovering over his pickup truck and it sent down
this beam of light onto his truck and the next thing he knew he found himself
and his pickup truck inside the object he's still sitting in his pickup truck at this point now his memory did go in
and out but he recalled seeing six beings which he said had claw-like hands
he says they were about his height or perhaps a little shorter they walked very stiffly and in fact he had the
impression that they might be robotic he said his body felt paralyzed numb he did
smell a sort of sulfur odor and he says they pulled him from his truck and he
found himself being examined by these beings he had the distinct impression that they were reading his mind
telepathically and that's really all he could recall the next thing he knew he was back on the highway but it was now a
half hour later and his truck was in a different location it was now on State Road
297 in Escambia County Florida which is about 29 miles away from where he was
taken and about 10 miles from his home at 2016 West Godfrey Street in
Pensacola so he drove home he immediately phoned the police he was put in touch with police Sergeant Lucien
Mitchell who questioned him about his experience and as sergeant Mitchell says
in his own words p P became very emotional and started crying he told me
that I thought he was some kind of nut and that he refused to tell this story again to anyone I might add when
Patterson was relating this incident to me he was very nervous and said from the beginning of the interview that no one
would believe him but officer Mitchell took the report seriously and as it
turned out no less than seven police officers in Escambia County had reported
seeing UFOs between 3:40 and 5 a.m. that same evening hovering just south of
Pensacola Beach so what's so amazing about Clarence Patterson's experience here is
that it is just one of more than two dozen that occurred in the US on that
same day and many of them involving humanoids now a good number of these
cases were covered in the book The Year of the humanoids by David
Webb what an amazing case that was given that there were so many other cases
occurring the same exact day that raises all kinds of questions I mean it's almost undeniable that something was
going on on that day how can so many people be reporting sightings and
landings and humanoids on one day it's crazy and now we move to the next case
which is probably the best known of this little compilation of six cases and this
one you may have heard before but I don't know if you've heard of all of the events surrounding it I thought it was
an important case that's why I wanted to present it to you today and I call it contact in vanata twero this is in
September of 1978 a number of events in the beginning of September again in Vado tuerto
Argentina and the main case is a sing witness case there's a lot of evidence
to support this case particularly because of the events that occurred both before and after it this case is one of
Argentina's better known encounters but what is not as well known are the many cases that are connected to it it
actually involves a series of amazing Close Encounters and one of the first
occurred to a gentleman by the name of Carlos a helan he's a carpenter it was
around 4 4:30 a.m. on September 3rd 1978 that Carlos was driving along
National Route 8 this is around the 350 km Mark which you can see here which
perhaps significantly is not far from a large water and power plant we do know
UFOs are attracted to installations at any rate to his left
Carlos saw about 2 kilomet away a very bright light over an empty field and as
he drove closer he saw that there were no less than seven large glowing
disc-shaped craft landed on the ground in this field he said they appeared to
have concave bottoms semispherical domes on top they were quite large about 12 m
in diameter they were all emitting an intense Bright Light which lit up the
environment around them like daylight but even more amazing he observed two humanoid figures moving around them and
they appeared to be performing various tasks now Carlos's car was now close
enough that he could see these beings pretty good he says they were very tall over 2 m in height at least 6 feet and
they were wearing white Co coveralls with dark helmets they were moving very slowly
around he saw one of them bend down picked something up off the ground and give it to the other humanoid
but he's still driving so as he's driving by them one of these craft rose
vertically upwards to a height of about 50 m 150 ft he says it then began to
move like a pendulum at this time it was emitting bright red and violet lights Carlos
continued driving just a short distance when this craft suddenly zoomed right towards him and shown two powerful beams
of light on his car which immediately began to lose both power and speed and
for the next 500 to 600 meters this disc followed him keeping these beams of
light trained on his car until suddenly darting back to its original
location Carlos who kept driving understandably he was quite frightened
this craft moves off and he tried to keep his eye on it but soon trees and
structures hid this craft from his View and that was his
experience but it was a case that occurred three days later in the same general area that would later become
world famous in fact this case was researched by jacqu fet and would appear
in his book confrontations the witness is 12-year-old Juan Oscar Perez and it was
around 645 a.m. on September 6 1978 Juan had been sent outside to do
his chores which involved Gathering a herd of horses for his family this was a foggy morning he was
riding home on his horse when he felt something flying overhead shortly later
he did see several objects appear maneuvering overhead emitting powerful
beams of colored light this caused the horses to panic and Gallop away in fact
Juan could barely control his own horse and quite frightened he fled home once
at home his father was not happy and sent him back out again to find the
horses so that's what Juan did he went back out on his horse he returned to the
field where the horses had been and this time he came upon a large round object
with a dome on top Windows around the edge basically a classic Flying Saucer
says it was about 12 m in diameter 36 ft or so and as he approached a door opened
in this craft a little ladder retracted out and seven and a 7ft tall humanoid
wearing a silver gray uniform and a cylindrical helmet emerged out of this
door he says a Hos likee tube went from this being suit back to inside the ship
and this being began speaking a strange language and used G gestures and
actually invited one inside this craft one was intrigued he accepted the
invitation in fact he tied his horse to this ladder that came out of the craft
and climbed up inside and as onean says was like a Hut but with a tall round
Dome I wanted to go in lights of Many Colors lit up as the horse was scared I
tied him to the huge ladder that came out which I remember was gray and very cold so onean had no experience with
UFOs he compared this to a Hut at any rate onean climbed inside the being
followed him one could see now that this being was wearing what looked like metallic gloves he noticed several
things in the interior of the craft he saw panels with what looked like buttons on them he saw some tables he saw a
smaller robotic looking being only about 4 feet tall which had sort of tools at
the end of its arms or extremity what looked like wheels for a base and
was sampling bones that looked like they came from a horse or a cow he was putting them in containers in fact a
week earlier Juan's father had found a dead cow in the fields near their
home now Juan tried to touch the being several times but he says it was weird
because each time he was thwarted by an invisible barrier of some kind now the experience ended abruptly
when the taller being pressed a button which caused the ladder to start to retract back into the craft so onean
seeing this quickly rushed back down the ladder to untie his horse the taller being followed onean asked this taller
being if he could keep one of the gloves and apparently this request was granted
because this being took off a glove and handed it to Juan now at this point one could see
that this being's hand was sort of greenish in color with what looked like bluish nails at the tip
at this point the toer being pricked Juan's arm which he perceived as sort of a blood sample being taken at any rate
Juan jumped on his horse at this point and began to gallop home with the glove still in his possession but he had only
gone a very short distance when he saw two objects emerge from this landed
craft and immediately began to follow him one of these emitted a small
spherical device which swept down right above Juan and sucked the glove back up
seemingly with magnetic force right up into it Juan then heard the craft behind
him emitting a loud piercing hum and he saw it take off and disappear into the
sky now this whole case was later the subject of a documentary called witness
of another world made in 2019 and as Juan says after the age of
12 my life changed what happened to me is something that even today I can't
understand for a long time I carried the fear with me now it turns out that
Juan's mother had also had a profound encounter with a UFO when she was 12 and
following that had very strong premonitions throughout her life and the
same thing happened to Carlos he started having all kinds of dreams that would come true he did have a dream that an
asteroid would come near Earth and cause great floods so this is a theme we see
again in a lot of contact accounts a very strange and unique case quite
incredible but it was just three days earlier that someone else had that
encounter which provides a level of corroboration as does an encounter which occurred two days after WS again in Vado
twero this third case occurred uh again two days later at 3 37
a.m. and the witness in this case is 16-year-old Roberto Francisco
Torres he was riding his bike along belgrano street again in venado tuerto
he was on his way to his place of employment a bakery he had to get there very early and he had just reached the
intersection of belgrano and Mitre which you can see here when he noticed that
the lighted store signs were becoming extinguished and at the same time the area around him
became very brightly illuminated from an object above him which was sending down
a huge beam of light so the witness in this case
Roberto says he felt a strong sensation of intense heat coming from it and
looking up he saw an oval-shaped craft with a dome on top it was about 10 m
wide he said hovering 50 m overhead said the base of the craft was glowing
bright red it had Port holes all around the edge of it and it was also emitting
this bright white light this craft was rocking smoothly back and forth both
surprised and terrified Roberto began riding his bike away as fast as he could
while at the same time yelling at the top of his lungs for somebody to come out and help him it was very early
nobody came out until until Roberto actually arrived at the bakery and the
owner there saw Roberto's frightened face now a later investigation revealed
something very interesting the water electric power company had registered a
blackout precisely at 3:37 a.m. which is the exact time of
Roberto's sighting a very unusual case I think by even ethological standards such
a shame that the witness wasn't able to get a keep that ET artifact this
glove uh which could have been you know the Smoking Gun evidence this sort of
thing does turn up in a number of cases people have an artifact and then they don't uh I mean that happened in the
Betty and Barney Hill case she was about to take a book off board the craft when the ETS changed their mind that looks
like what happened here at any rate it's it's a pretty compelling case with so
many cases occurring around that time in that area pretty well-known case very well
investigated and certainly one that adds to our knowledge of what's going on here and now we moveed to another case
which is virtually unknown I call this one contact in summer Court this
occurred on July 10 1983 in summer Court France this is in
the hot Mar area this is a very rural area but a really amazing case uh
involving a single witness to a certain extent though his whole family did see
UFOs uh and while this poor witness he was really traumatized by his encounter
as we shall see I really feel for the witness in this case Stefan gasparovic
he was affected quite profoundly by his encounter in fact it was on July 8th
through the 9th that Stefan a 45-year-old fireman woodworker an
employee at a nearby Furniture Factory decided to go camping with his family
and a neighbor on the summer Court Plateau not far from their home in summert this is in eastern France he has
six children by the way so they're all camping and it was around 3 a.m. when he
observed a blindingly bright quote ball of fire over head he said it had a kind
of funnel at the base was pretty low in the sky about 600 ft 200 M he saw it
three times that night so this is quite unusual and it returned again the next
night they were still out there camping and he saw it in fact it affected him so
profoundly and it scared his family that they decided to cut their camping trip
short but Stefan was very curious so the next night on Sunday July 10th he
decided to return alone to the summer Court plateau and this time he took a pair of binoculars with him it was
around 1 p.m. that this strange glowing object made a third appearance but this
time instead of hovering overhead at about 600 ft it came zooming down
straight for him and he could now see that this sphere was about 3 m wide
had a luminous upper section and it was actually a craft cuz inside he could see three figures very short No taller than
3 feet he said that they were wearing jumpsuits which looked green in color it
absolutely terrified him he threw himself to the ground he lay flat on his
stomach and he says this object hung just over him when suddenly he felt
himself being drawn upwards as Stefan says I was lying fing
in the alala field and I saw this ball of fire which suddenly came to a stop with a strange noise directly above me
my whole body was sucked up as if by a vacuum cleaner I was sucked up by it
after that I didn't remember much more it all goes black I felt a violent gust
of wind and roared I don't know how long it lasted but it went very
quickly so meanwhile stefon's family was becoming very concerned midnight had
arrived and Stefan still had not returned from his outing so they went out looking for him and they became even
more concerned when they found his car with the doors open but there was no
sign of Stefan so they returned home it was now around a half hour after midnight and to
their shock Stefan was there at the house and after being pulled up into
this craft he had only partial recall of what happened but he does remember some
of it he said it was very dark inside very warm you could hear this strange
sort of Tut Tut Tut noise he felt movement but his next memory was being
let go as Stefan says finally I was dropped from a height of 2 m into a
field 6 km away so yeah he was dropped off in a different location he walked
home from there and his eldest son theer says and I quote he lay dazed on his bed
and did not recognize anyone he mumbled a number of incoherent sentences and
kept repeating those little guys are fat and ugly and they have spots his daughter Christine verifies
this she's 17 years old and as she says and again I quote Papa was sitting on
the bed with wild and vacant eyes he was murmuring you will never believe me he
kept talking about quote the little ones with pointed ears in short he frightened
us terribly and as Stefan's wife says I have never seen him like this in fact
Stefan was so disoriented so traumatized he didn't know his own name he started
saying he was a Spaniard with a completely different name Evan azard and suddenly at 2 am he jumps up
and in this weird trance he marches outside and starts shouting they are up
there and I am going to them in fact looking outside they could see this
object still hovering over the summer Court Plateau they were bewildered concerned
afraid they dragged him back inside called an ambulance and had him taken to
the local hospital now going outside with when the ambulance arrived Stefan's wife and his
Eld his son theier and the driver of the ambulance Francis we all could still see
this yellow orange ball hanging above the simmer Court plateau and later it was discovered that
other people in the area had also seen this strange light they went up there uh
his family and they did find a circular Landing Trace now at the hospital Stefan was
diagnosed with some eye TR light sensitivity of course memory loss they
found bruises on his body he wandered around in a days for quite some time
kept saying that he had spoken to quote fat ugly little men with pointed ears
they kept him in the hospital for about 10 days thankfully making a full recovery
at least physically emotionally he remained traumatized and as he says he will quote never again set foot on that
Dam Amed Mountain that's the kind of case that is truly undeniable yes it is
a single witness case but you have his whole family seeing UFOs his whole family a large
family uh confirming what he went through in terms of the
trauma physiological evidence Landing trace evidence clearly something quite
unusual happened and we even have the ambulance driver seeing the UFO
really amazing case it's a shame he can't remember more what happened to him but on the other hand he did remember it
consciously without the a of hypnosis and I think that's significant and now we move to another
case which is equally compelling if not more so because this does involve two
witnesses who were both taken on board at the same time I call this one contact
in Goodland this occurred on November 7 1989 in Goodland Kansas this case was
very thoroughly researched involves two women who were driving along the highway late at night had missing time finally
elected to go under hypnosis and independently recalled many details that
pretty much matched perfectly so it's a really important case it shows that
hypnosis does work in recalling events because it's almost impossible for
people to recall the same darn details matching up almost perfectly now this
case from John Carpenter is amazing this was published in the 1991 volume 3 issue
of the Journal of UFO studies and it's my favorite case in this compilation this is an amazing
double witness case the Witnesses are Anonymous known only as Susan and
Jennifer at the time of this experience Susan was a 42 2-year-old businesswoman
married with two children 17 and 21 she had no interest or prior knowledge in
UFOs and her friend Jennifer was a 49-year-old freelance photographer she had two adult
stepchildren and like Susan had never really given much thought to UFOs they had attended a convention in
Aspen Colorado and were driving from Aspen to their homes in St Louis
Missouri was around 11:40 p.m. again on November 7
1989 as they left a gas station in Flagler Colorado and were heading East
on Interstate 70 towards Goodland Kansas about 72 miles away where they plan to
stop for the night at a motel but almost immediately after getting on interstate
70 they both simultaneously noticed a bright object ahead of them on the
highway to the side and it was flashing colored lights
and it stayed off in the distance but seemed to pce their car for the next hour in fact they pulled off the road
several times to look at it because of its unusual appearance but suddenly at 12:40 p.m. after they had just pulled
over and got back on the road again this light zoomed towards them stopping at a
distance of only about 100 ft hovering over this field to the right it sent on
a cone of colored light pastel pinks Blues lavender they also noticed weird
quote black waves kind of like heat waves which were visible on the lower part of the windshield both were very
excited a little scared by the sight of this strange object so close this point
they were just outside of Goodland Kansas but the next thing they knew their mood had changed from being
excited to exhausted and irritated they immediately stopped at a rest stop
were surprised to find that the bathrooms were closed this point they could still see the UFO now off some
distance so they continued driving the UFO disappeared they arrived at a motel
in Goodland but it was now 2:30 a.m. it was not at first obvious to them that
they were missing about an hour of time both felt physically ill Jennifer was a
little bit flushed and Susan and she says she felt like quote death warmed
over so it was the next morning that they went over this and realized that something very odd had
occurred because although 3 hours had elapsed
during this trip the gas gauge on their car showed that only an hour's worth of
gas had been used and this is only a 72m trip which took 3 hours even though
their speed was about 75 M hour they also noticed a weird black streak
on the sun visor that hadn't been there before following this experience
Jennifer began suffering from some unexplained nose bleeds both felt quite anxious and
irritable they had insomnia so it was about two weeks later
after researching their experience and looking into this subject of UFOs that they decided that they were
going to go under hypnosis now these sessions were done separately
and what they recalled is very interesting cuz Jennifer recalled seeing the UFO as she had seen it consciously
but then she recalled being pulled out of the car as she says I'm behind it looking down at an
angle very quickly she watched this their car shrink down to a tiny size and
looking up she saw that she was approaching this craft it had rounded Port holes and sudden fin she found
herself inside this rounded room illuminated with an orange light and as
Jennifer says there's no corners in this room it's round kind of like a frisbee
the various windows are dark but when you look out of them you can see bright lights you can see all the stars the
heavens are just full of them I'm looking out the windows and it's the Earth were
high also she noticed several figures surrounding her five 5 and 1/2t Tall
beings with grayish skin large hairless heads pointy chins huge slanted dark
eyes so they had no real nose or mouth uh yeah very pale skin it did not
appear to be dressed she couldn't tell for sure she did notice that they had four long fingers and some she said had
what looked like suction cups on their fingers she said that they started communicating with her telepath atically
took her to another larger room placed her on this floating table she saw this
panel of what looked like colored lights she noticed that the room had a central column in it so this is what Jennifer
initially recalled and meanwhile Susan going under hypnosis recalled essentially the same thing she saw the
UFO suddenly approach their car get brighter and the next thing she knows
she's being pulled from the car and like Jennifer she's watching it get smaller and smaller below her and as she says as
she's being pulled up it's real light we don't weigh much it's more like floating and like Jennifer she found
herself in a room which as Susan says is quote like a circle Susan said she saw
Windows around the sides she could see stars outside and like Jennifer she saw
the Earth itself as Susan says looking out one of the windows a blue Globe like
pictures you might see of planets but it's not a picture it's real pretty she was taken to a larger room
she saw a floating table near the center in the middle of this room was a large column she saw what looked like cabinets
in the wall she saw what looked like hieroglyphic symbols on the wall and of
course she saw these beings and described them just like Jennifer had described them as Susan says
they're more slender they have really dark huge eyes slanted eyes the eyes are
enormous and take over the face now uh Su Jennifer had said that these
beings moved around by gliding and Susan said the same thing they sort of glided around rather than walking she did
notice that one of the beings was quite a bit taller than the others now Jennifer said that the beings
seemed very friendly and they wanted to examine her and as Jennifer says they
were reassuring us we should not be afraid they're not going to hurt us they came over and patted my hand that made
me feel comfortable they're not going to hurt us and Susan said the same thing as
Susan says they seem to be communicating that they mean us no harm they try to
calm me somebody keeps rubbing my head with those hands they passed this hand
over Jennifer's forehead which seems either to calm her or sedate her she's
lying on a narrow table covered with some type of white material now it looked to Susan like
Jennifer was undergoing some type of procedure they seem to show a special interest in Jennifer's hands Susan also
saw that they were placing something inside of Jennifer's nose and this is exactly what Susan recalled as
well now Susan was communicating with them to a certain extent
and they were explaining what they were doing as Susan says they're working for the advancement of something about
genetic coding it is an agreement we had before our birth and it is for the
advancement of the species and the advancement of planet Earth Jennifer
also recalls like Susan that the beings were examining her hands she watched a panel of lights light up she wasn't able
to see Susan which is also what Susan recalled she could see Jennifer but Jennifer couldn't see
her and as Jennifer says I don't remember anything else just that I was
hooked up for a span of time I think I asked what are you going to do to me
they said they needed to have more information about what my chemistry is all about something was being energized
through my system when they were taking all these tests taking information from me from my body
chemistry now Susan recalls being given a thick liquid to drink and the next
thing both women recall is being floated back down to their car and as Jennifer
says it's as if we're just kind of descending we're floating through the sky then gently coming down to earth
they led us out to the right of the car Jennifer remembers thinking to herself I
was somewhere I've never been before nor have I ever seen anything like this before and as soon and says one of the
aliens does something with his hands a movement with his hands and we seem to be on our way back to the car we don't
fall we come down faster we're back into the car they are seeing that we get back
into the car they wave their hands over our foreheads and we don't remember so
at this point both women say that their memories left them after undergoing
hypnosis both Susan and Jennifer were shocked by their detailed recall but
both did feel an enormous sense of relief neither felt that the experience was bad it was overall a positive
experience for them as Susan says I can honestly say what happened to me was a
positive experience and I can say that because I have grown from it I think I am a much better person for having had
my little world shattered and for opening up to new possibilities of what this life might be all all about how
interesting is that I wonder how many people have this kind of experience and never seek help never go under hypnosis
but they did they both recall being pulled on board seeing the car a tiny
little dot below them being placed on tables physically examined both remember
looking out the window and seeing the Earth both remember seeing pretty much the same kinds of ETS everything from
the way they looked the way they're dressed the way they moved all of it matches up it's a really compelling case
and now we move to another one which is super interesting like many onboard
experiences this is a single witness case I call this one contact in De Bren
this occurred in December of 1990 in Deen Hungary and it's a really interesting
case because the area where it occurred is the same for a number of other UFO
incidents which I've actually covered on previous episodes but this one is an onboard encounter involving a very
unusual humanoid while he doesn't remember a lot of what happened it's
certainly an important case this final case comes from respected Hungarian researcher Gabor tarali and it was
published in the July August 1993 issue of the qorn bulletin the main witness is
a former geography teacher now an artist by the name of Gabor molar and it was
around 10:30 p.m. as Gabor was driving along Highway 35 after visiting his
child in the hospital at deis he was heading home he had just driven past the
town of josa when something very strange happened and I'll just let Gabor
describe it in his own words as he says my car stopped I did not know why and
then the engine stopped also I remember a little green being stood facing me at
the roadside his eyes were large out of proportion what happened after that I do
not know only some fragments of memory remained in my mind I have dim
Recollections of a room with several windows and I lay on something I suppose
I was examined I remember green beings bent over me who looked at me with large
eyes that had no pupils I do not know what they did with me or how much time I spent with them
when I recovered I was sitting in my car the car was in the middle of the road at an angle facing deers in the opposite
direction I do not know the exact time I started my car and I came home so
following this encounter Gabor said as he started to suffer from headaches he also noticed something
interesting his style of painting changed dramatically prior to this encounter he
was painting mostly portraits and Landscapes but afterwards he began
producing paintings of strange foreign Landscapes which seemed to be on other
planets and while painting this is when he would have vivid flashbacks of seeing
these little green entities and being on the ship and being examined so at first he told nobody
about his counter except his wife who was shocked and skeptical but one day he did tell his
friend Peter txy who it turns out is a reporter an art afficianado who does
have an strong interest in UFOs and gabar told him Peter a very strange
thing happened to me please do not laugh if I tell you thankfully Peter did not
laugh Gabor shared his story Peter absolutely believed him him and this is what led to the case being officially
investigated and as Peter says Gabor molar has had a good reputation but his
new paintings greatly surprised his artistic friends too now Gabor himself
says that he never believed in UFOs before his encounter but of course now he does as Gabor says now I believe in
UFOs without any doubt and I willing to be taken again I will never forget that
night there you go another case of a person being taken on board I like this
case because the main investigator Gabor tarali is a very thorough
researcher appears to be an absolute legitimate case it fits the pattern we see in so many other cases said it
before I think these kinds of events are far more common than most people
realize as I've said said in previous episodes there was a study done in 1991
by the Roper organization which does polling and they did a whole survey on
this and found that as many as one in 50 people show the markers of being a UFO
contacte problem is most people don't talk about it so this is one of the
reasons I do the This research and these episodes is because there's a lot of you
guys out there who've had this experience I know a lot of you watching have had these
experiences so this is a subject that deserves truth and transparency deserves to be far better
known than it is so you know it's an important subject I think if everyone
knew that we are not alone in this universe it would change the way people think and act and we might come together
instead of having all these wars and Division and all the problems that are besetting Humanity at this current time
at any rate it's also just darn interesting so that's it for today thank
you guys for watching I love these onboard encounters they're so interesting I think these cases do show
how it can be quite difficult quite traumatic and scary for people to undergo and I also find it interesting
that a good number of these Witnesses said that you know this experience was
benevolent certainly not all the man from France he clearly did not like this experience
but the Goodland Kansas case the Hungary case both said that they would welcome
further contact so certainly an interesting detail once again thank you I truly
appreciate you guys watching until next time keep your eyes in the skies keep
searching for the truth it's out there keep asking those hard questions but most important of all keep having fun I
I think that's why we're here to learn and have fun so I will see you next Friday bye for now.
