FIVE INCREDIBLE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
May 9, 2025

Summary:
May 9, 2025
Being taken onboard a UFO! It is the ultimate type of UFO encounter, the most extensive, and the most controversial. There are thousands of cases on record. These cases have the greatest potential to answer the many questions surrounding the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, such as who are these strange visitors, where do they come from and why are they here? This video presents five little known cases coming from all over the world. In each of these cases, the witnesses held long conversations with the extraterrestrials. Each of these cases was investigated by researchers. The five cases here add to the growing database of close encounters of the fourth kind, making it increasingly undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

TIME DOESN’T EXIST. One night in April 1970, lawyer, Raymond Shearer, (pseudonym) was driving outside Madison, Wisconsin and saw a light over his car. He felt compelled to turn off on a remote road and came upon an ET craft. Suddenly, it was morning, and he was arriving home. Beset with anxiety, he visited a therapist. Making no progress, the therapist tried hypnosis, and recalled that he was taken onboard a craft by human-looking ETs who examined him and said that humans do not understand the nature of time, how they fly their craft, that humans are too warlike for open contact, and that the ETs have lost some of their people to conflicts with humans. They talked about the power of water and many other topics, including advising Raymond about his career.

WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS. On February 28, 1974, Dirant Mello Ferraz (age 18) was in his home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when he was pulled into a craft. Onboard, he met a twin of himself who departed the craft and took Dirant’s place for a full 24-hours, learning all he could about life on Earth. Meanwhile Dirant was kept onboard. He asked the ETs many questions, which they answered, about why they chose him, what their mission on Earth was, would they invade our planet, did they believe in God, and much more. They asked him to tell the people of Earth that they are friendly and that it is their mission to help humanity. After 24 hours, Dirant was returned to his home. Dirant’s case was thoroughly researched, but afterward, he just wanted to forget about the encounter and live a normal life.

THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AREN’T READY. On December 25, 1976, an anonymous teacher, “Francisco,” was hunting outside of Merida, Spain when he became tired and fell asleep. Waking up, it was night, and he realized a weird tentacle-like device was pulling on his arm. To his shock, it was attached to a strange craft a short distance away. He fainted and when he awoke, he thought he was in a hospital. But when big-eyed, scaly-skinned creatures entered, he realized he was inside a craft. After examining him, they gave him a tour of the craft, showed him an alien arboretum, and fed him strange alien foods. They said they were on a benevolent scientific expedition to study Earth, that their culture is far older than ours, that humans are not ready for contact, and that it was his duty to tell the world about them.

THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF MATTER. At 9pm on September 20, 1979, two men in Sztum, Poland were shocked to see a UFO hover overhead. Suddenly they found themselves flying upward into the craft. Inside, each held telepathic conversations with unseen entities who talked on various topics such as mathematics, physics, the nature of matter and more. Suddenly they were deposited back onto the ground and watched the craft dart away. Both men had severe headaches. They tried to share their experience with friends, who ridiculed them. Later, their case was extensively studied, and it was learned that one year earlier, another truly remarkable encounter had occurred in the same area.

WE WON’T DO YOU ANY HARM. On the night of January 12, 2008, the Voronezhsky family were puzzled by the appearance of strange lights above their home in Dubno, Ukraine. Going to bed, they were awakened in the middle of the night by a light illuminating their home. Rushing outside, they saw a giant craft overhead. Suddenly the parents, Vladimir and Olga, were pulled up into the craft. Vladimir was unable to move as his wife was examined. The gray-type ETs were very polite as they told the couple about ET society, and their interest in human emotions. They said that they were able to travel great distances, turn their ships invisible and much more. They gave the couple a tour through space and then returned them home. Vladimir discovered he had greater strength and endurance, and Olga was healed of colitis.

Five onboard experiences, each with amazing similarities and unique details, each providing further evidence of extraterrestrial intervention on planet Earth. It is unknown exactly how many people have had an experience like this, but some researchers believe it may number in the millions.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
Today I'm going to be talking about my favorite type of UFO encounter and that is an onboard UFO experience. These
types of encounters actually contain all different types of UFO encounters.
Sightings, landings, facetof face encounters with humanoids, and of course going inside an extraterrestrial craft.
The title of today's episode is five incredible onboard UFO
encounters. These cases are of course very controversial. Skeptics do not like
them. But the fact is there are so many of them. The evidence for them is
overwhelming. I have no doubt that this is happening all over the world. There
are so many cases. And what's interesting is these are the kinds of
cases that really hold the most information, really have the potential to answer all of the questions we have
surrounding this subject. Who are these visitors to our planet? Where do they come from? Why are they here? And so
forth. So, I've got five cases today which are really interesting and unusual
because each of them is very extensive. The witnesses were able to hold fairly
long conversations with the ETSs and got all kinds of information about them. So
these five cases range from 1970 to 2008 coming from a number of different
locations on our planet including Spain,
Ukraine, Poland, also Brazil, and one in the United States, specifically Wisconsin. A
couple of these are multiple witness cases. In every single one of these cases, these people were affected
profoundly physically, emotionally, and so forth. So, yeah, these are really
astonishing cases, and I think it behooves everyone to take these kinds of
cases seriously, if only for the fact that there are so many of them. Each of
them do contain details that corroborate each other and each contain unique
details as well as we shall see. But let's just start with our first case which I call time doesn't exist. This is
not a very well-known case but very extensive. This occurred sometime in April 1970 in Madison, Wisconsin. The
witness is anonymous as a lot of people who have this experience elect to be.
But his case, I think, is an important one because he got so much information. It's really an amazing case. This case
comes from Warren Smith. He first wrote about it in the May 1973 issue of Saga
magazine under the pseudonym Eric Norman, but later published it in his book, The Book of Encounters. The
witness is a small town lawyer. He's anonymous, but uses the pseudonym Raymond Sheerer. He was 32 years old at
the time of his encounter. And when it occurred, he had just held a late night meeting with a client at a restaurant in
Madison, Wisconsin. It was after midnight. This was one evening in April
1970. As he drove out of Madison, he was about 20 mi out of town when he noticed
a strange light hovering above the highway ahead of him. He assumed it was just a helicopter and didn't really pay
much attention to it. But as he drove under it, he did notice that his car
radio filled with static. The car itself began to heat up and he also developed a
sort of instant headache. He slowed down, grabbed a bottle of aspirin from the glove compartment, and took two of
them and just kept driving. He was about 10 mi from his house when, for some
reason, as he says, I don't know why, he slammed on the brakes and turned off on a dead end remote gravel road. There
were no structures on this road. And driving down it, he came over a hill and
had to slam on his brakes. He actually skidded to a stop about 15 ft from a
large discshaped craft sitting in the center of the road. You could see it had
a row of lights kind of glowed with a blue green color. Immediately his car
engine died, his headlights and dashs went out and his radio stopped playing.
He was very scared. As Raymond says, I started to whimper and cry. I was scared
to death because this was something I didn't know about. I remember trying to snap down the locks on the doors of the
car. I saw some shadowy forms walking towards the car. Then I must have blanked out. The next thing Raymond
knew, he was driving home. The sun was just coming up. For some reason, it didn't quite dawn on him that he had
experienced hours of missing time. And really, at first, all he could recall was seeing this initial bright light
above the highway. Arriving home, he still had a headache. He laid down on the couch and although he was tired, he
couldn't sleep because he kept hearing the strange rattling sound. Finally, his wife woke up and began fixing breakfast.
And this is when Raymond noticed a welt on the back of his neck just above the spinal cord. And by noon, it had quote
blistered up. He said it was very sore and painful. So, he went to the doctor who was very puzzled by the appearance
of small perforations on Raymond's skin where this welt was. And as Raymond
says, he said it was the strangest thing he had ever seen. He put some salt on
it. The welt gradually went away. But following this, Raymond's personality
experienced a big change. He became nervous and anxious. He began neglecting
his law practice. And instead, weirdly, he found himself becoming obsessed with
politics. He had no idea why. As Raymond says, "It seemed important for me to get
into politics. I was never interested in political office before that time.
Things soon became worse. His headaches continued. He began to argue with his wife and his law partner. And it got so
bad that finally his father convinced him to go visit a psychiatrist. Several weeks of therapy
seemed to make no progress. But then the psychiatrist decided to try hypnosis to find the
reason for Raymond's anxiety. And it worked. This broke down the wall of
amnesia and Raymond immediately began having flashbacks of this light over the
highway, the craft in the road. Both the doctor and the patient were absolutely
shocked to find out that the UFOs were the cause of Raymond's anxiety. So, his
first impulse was to go buy a bunch of UFO books and magazines and read up on this subject. But the doctor advised
against it, told him not to do this, and instead the doctor educated himself
about the UFO subject. And only then did they continue the hypnosis sessions. And
using hypnosis, this entire onboard experience was revealed. Under hypnosis,
Raymond recalled seeing this craft on the road in front of him and the car stalling. He saw a figure appear at the
driver's side. And as Raymond says, I didn't get much more than a glimpse of him. He looked at me for a second. There
was a blinding flash. Then I opened the door and stepped out. He could see that this man was holding a strange
instrument up to his neck. Told him not to be alarmed, that it wouldn't hurt, but would help him to talk to them. He
felt a strange tingle over his body, and as he says, "I felt funny for a minute.
Then the fear seemed to leave me. My hands stopped trembling. My head cleared
up. I wasn't so confused. A warm feeling came over my body. And I felt these
people were my friends. So Raymond now saw that there were five figures, three of which were collecting samples of
sticks and plants and other things from the ground and putting them in boxes. As
Raymond says, they worked very fast. They seemed to be picking up as many different types of things as they could.
He noticed that one of the figures stood guard while the other, who was holding the instrument up to his neck, seemed to
be in charge. He says these figures looked largely human, but sort of reminded him of ancient Egyptians. He
said they had long flattish faces, slanted eyes, very thin lips, more like
a slit than a regular mouth, he said, and very light colored skin. He said they were about 5 to 5 and 1/2 ft tall
but had very strong bodies, larger chests than most humans. They all wore
coveralls and helmets. He said they never blinked. And as he said, when they looked at me, they stared straight into
my eyes. Very unusual eyes, he said. Now Raymond could see that the craft looked
like metallic aluminum and was he estimates about 100 to 125 ft in
diameter. It was resting on tripod landing gear. It was saucer-shaped. It
had what looked like an antenna in the rear. And while the beings were collecting specimens, Raymond did look
at his watch and saw that it was 1:47 in the morning. Now, seeing this, leader
asked him what type of time he used. Raymond began to explain the concept of
days, months, and years. And the being's reply was that humans needed to learn
how to handle time correctly. He said that time as we know it doesn't exist.
That they, the ETSs, have the ability to distort time, speed it up, slow it down,
or even stop it. This point, the leader put his hand on Raymon's shoulder and
led him to the craft. He saw that there was a ladder leading up into this craft,
and shaking, Raymon was told to go inside, which he did. inside the craft.
He was amazed to see that it looked much bigger on the inside than the outside. Said it was very cold inside and quite
uncomfortable. So then they had him hold a strange metal rod and stand in front of this blank screen and explain that
they were recording his vitals, his body temperature, his brain waves, his weight, his height, and other data about
him. He said that the people inside the UFO quote seemed like pretty nice people, but he wondered if he would
survive this experience. The unusualness of this experience and the environment
around him was causing him all kinds of anxiety. As he says, I didn't feel right
while I was in there because everything was different. There was something funny about the ship. I couldn't feel or hear
the sound of my feet when I walked around. This sort of made me feel like the ship was a ghost or something, but
it was definitely metal. He saw that there were very few furnishings other than some chairs and what looked like
desks, all of which were made out of the same material as the craft. He did see other strange computer-like machines.
The leader said that these machines were used to guide the craft. He saw no windows or port holes. This confused
him, but the leader said that they used screens to see outside and then told him that they were able to maneuver their
craft using Earth's gravitational field and could use gravity to draw them
towards the planet or repel them away from it using a form of anti-gravity and
actually told him that scientists on Earth were getting very close to developing and understanding this. They
explained that they came from another galaxy. They told him all kinds of things. They said water has an energy in
it that we don't fully understand. They explained that they can use energy to render their ships invisible. They said
that many different types of ETs are visiting Earth and that others visit more often than they themselves do. They
said their mission was a scientific expedition to determine the characteristics of planet Earth. And he
said that humans are very violent and have actually been very hostile towards them. That they have on occasion lost
some of their crew to conflicts with humans. And he said that while humans are advanced in some areas, they are
very backwards in other areas. And it said that humans are not ready for the ETSs to reveal themselves to
humanity. At one point, they put a cone-like device on Raymond's head which
they said would give him great knowledge. This turned out to be the most unpleasant part of his experience
for him. He said he felt a great pressure in his head and felt almost as though his brain was being scrambled. As
he says, "It was the most painful thing I've ever experienced." At one point they told him
that he should get into politics as they needed a friend in politics and they
told him that they would meet again. Finally, they took him off the craft.
Raymond asked them for a momento or a souvenir and they did not respond but
told him to remain in his car until the craft took off. The ET returned into the
craft. The ladder retracted. The craft made a loud buzzing noise and took off at a diagonal, taking about 30 seconds
to disappear. Immediately, Raymond's car started up. His lights came back on and
he drove off. Now, Raymond has not reported any further contacts or if he
did, he's not talking about them. But he did say that he feels there is probably still more to the experience that than
he can at this point remember. But he absolutely believes it did happen and
that the hypnotic recall is accurate. As he says, I know now that it was real. I
felt the metal on that ladder. These people are real because they squeezed me on the arm. I believe that someday
somewhere we will meet again. Raymond agreed to come forward with his story only on the promise of complete
anonymity but he felt it was important as he says I want the material to be
published but I don't want to be exposed as a UFO nut. I would lose my entire
practice if this came out. Now, the researcher, Warren Smith, says that he was given full access to the hypnosis
tapes and doctor's notes, and Raymond himself says he still considers a career
in politics, but has not yet done so. I think you'll agree that was a very
extensive encounter. The witness learned all kinds of information, and while he
did find it quite frightening, overall, it was a benevolent experience. He did not believe that these ETs were hostile
in any way and as you can see it did affect him very profoundly changed his
life completely. It was very difficult for him initially and like many many
witnesses he kept quiet for quite some time. I like the case also because it
was thoroughly researched. Uh has doctor reports you know he did go under
hypnosis but again recalled much of this you know without the aid of hypnosis
including you know this initial sighting and the landing but most of the onboard experience of course was recovered under
hypnosis. This is not always the case. For example, this next case was fully
conscious. And this is a truly interesting and unusual case. There's
not a lot like this in the UFO literature. I call this next one we are
your friends. This occurred on February 28, 1974 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It
is a single witness case. The witness did allow his first name to be used. It
was thoroughly researched, but this one has some of the most unusual details of
any case I've ever heard. This very unusual onboard encounter was first investigated by researcher Fernando
Cleto Nunez Pereira and was later re-resarched by Irene Granchi. They both
interviewed the witness firsthand and the witness's name is Durant Miller.
He was born in 1956 and he was 18 years old when his encounter occurred. He said
it was 7:30 p.m. on February 28th, 1974. He was alone in the kitchen of his
home, his family's home, when without warning, he found himself, as he says,
somewhere else. He found himself in this squarish room color of smoked glass.
There were no doors or windows, a cone-shaped ceiling above him. He immediately heard a voice speaking in
his native language of Portuguese, and it said, "Stay calm. We are your
friends." He now realized that this voice was coming from a flickering box-like device in the corner of the
room. At this point, he saw that the watch he was wearing had stopped working
and read 7:31 p.m. Suddenly, without warning, an opening appeared on the
blank wall, and he says a very large egg-shaped device moved towards him. It
was the same smoky glass color as the room he was in. And at the same moment the object came towards him, a yellow
beam of light shone down on him from the cone-shaped ceiling. And this voice again repeated for Durant to remain
calm. And to his utter shock, a human figure stepped out from this egg-shaped
object and revealed itself to be Durant's double when of himself looked just like
him. Now, the voice from the box instructed him to touch the man before him, which he did. Verifying that this
was a flesh and blood human being, or at least looked like one, Don's twin patted
him on the back and said, "Keep calm. Wish me a good journey, for I do not
intend to harm anybody." At that point, the twin walked through the wall, and on
the wall, Durant could now see a screen, and to his amazement, it showed his twin
now in his own home, apparently impersonating him. Durant was allowed to see his twins
interactions with the people around him. Now those who knew Durant could see he
was behaving differently. He was normally a very friendly and affectionate person. Whereas this twin
was not quite the same way. He behaved very gruffly towards Durant's sister and
also to the driver who came to pick up Durant and drive him to his family's company where he worked at that time.
So, this twin seemed to be ignorant of social interactions and behaviors, at least to some degree, he did not know
how to handle money or fill out an invoice. So, intensely curious, as you
can imagine, about what was happening, Durant asked out loud, "What do you want
with me?" And a voice replied, "We need to conclude some tests. We do not harm
anybody. The less you say about this, the better. However, we should like to
make it known that we are friendly and only wish to help. So he asked, "Who are
you? What is your world like?" The answer was, "We cannot tell you who we
are. Our world is different from yours." So he continued to ask questions asking
if they were planning to invade Earth, to which a voice replied, "We are not
invaders. We work for the good of the human race." Durant asked why he had
been chosen and they said you are different from others and have feelings similar to our own. He asked about food
and they said he will not feel hungry. He did ask them do they know the
existence of God and the answer was clearly so of course he is everywhere.
Everybody knows him. So, still asking questions, he asked about this twin and
was told that he was actually one of the ETs. So, he's still on the craft. And
while he was on there, this voice told him that it was his duty to assist his
twin functioning on Earth. And Durant found that by looking through the screen
at his twin, he could not only see his twin, but look through his eyes. On
occasion though, the screen was turned off, and this left Durant ignorant of
what his double was doing. And as it turned out, this double was showing all kinds of unusual
characteristics. Seemed to be very concerned about plants and trees, even mending the limb of a broken tree, but
seemed to treat those around him roughly and with ill manners. So all this time,
Durant was still in the same room. He saw that it did have a shelf, a small
bed, but no pillows or blankets. It was fixed to the wall. There was also a small movable stool. He said the
temperature of the room was normal. He noticed that although he spent many hours in there, he never felt tired or
hungry. He wasn't sure how long he was in there, but it appeared to be at least one full day. Now, when the screen went
dark, he became bored. And at one point, he wished he had something to read. And immediately the small shelf glowed red
around the edges and the newspaper, a couple of books, and an issue of
Spider-Man appeared on the shelf. Now, Durant later learned that this issue of
Spider-Man had not even been released yet. On another occasion, he felt lonely
for his girlfriend. The shelf glowed again, and he was given a letter from her, which had apparently just arrived
at his home. So, he did lay down a few times on this little bed, but never slept. He never ate or went to the
bathroom and suddenly he found himself back in his kitchen. And it was exactly
24 hours later. His watch, which had stopped, immediately started working
again. And speaking with his family, he learned that they had been very puzzled by his gruff behavior over the last 24
hours. It's not clear in the report whether or not he told his family about his experience, but he did inquire about
his twin's behavior and learned some interesting things. It turned out that his twin had taken a taxi and in the
back seat had found a lady's handbag which had been left there and he returned it to the owner. So Durant
followed up on this and learned that yes, this had in fact happened. He learned that one of his co-workers was
shocked when his twin appeared behind him as though walking through the wall.
He learned that his twin had spent some time reading Durant's own books about Brazilian history, science, geography,
several newspapers. He was seen collecting flowers, leaves, and taking pictures of Rio de Janeiro, which he
apparently took with him back into the craft. Durant did agree to be interviewed
saying, quote, "People will not believe my story, but I would like you to publish this statement of theirs." We
are friends and only wish to help. Now, when Irene Grunchy interviewed him
later, he did agree to be interviewed, but told her that he now just wanted to forget about the experience. Irene says
her impression of him was that he was quote cordial and polite. He did confirm
all the details reported by the previous investigator, Fernando Plato Nunees
Pereira, but Durant said that he now has no interest in speaking about the
encounter. How crazy is that? Imagine being taken on board a craft and seeing
what amounts to your twin, your double. You know, that is unusual certainly, but
it's not unique. I do know of a number of other cases where people have had this sort of experience. It's hard to
say exactly what's going on here, but certainly fascinating. This case is also
very interesting because like the others, he did get a lot of information and was able to hold
conversations and also felt ultimately that this was a positive experience. Though, as I said, currently he doesn't
want to talk about it, just wants to forget about it and lead a normal life.
But kudos to him for going public, allowing his real name to be used and
subjecting himself to the research from, you know, professional investigators. So, there's a lot to
unpack with all of these cases and I think it's a really fascinating
account. Now, I'd like to move to the next one. This is another single witness case where the person who had this
experience did elect to remain anonymous uh but finally did come forward uh said
he only wanted his story published after he passed away which I think is kind of interesting but I call this one the
people of earth aren't ready. This one occurred on December 25,
1976 in Marita, Spain. And like the other cases, this was very difficult,
quite traumatic for the witness. Pretty scary. Ultimately, he decided, no, this
was not a negative experience, though. Yeah, it was really quite unusual and he
had a difficult time processing. It did affect him physically as we've seen in all of these cases. And it's such an
extensive case. Uh the messages he received are just so fascinating. I
think you'll find it a really interesting case. This case comes from researcher Pedro Maria Fernandez and was
published in his Spanish language book Los Visitantes Des Konosidos the unknown visitors. The
witness is known only by his initials FA. He's a fine arts professor and he
agreed to have his story told again only after he passed away. He was born in
1930. I'll just call him Francisco. This is a pseudonym. He was 49 years old at
the time of his encounter. It was the morning of December 12, 1976. As Francisco and two of his
students were walking near the Madrid Caceris Railway outside of Marita,
Spain, and they were out hunting birds. Suddenly, they came upon a very
thick patch of fog. was weird because it seemed to be rectangular in shape, 300
feet long, six feet high, and was situated among some olive trees. And no
sooner did they notice this wall of fog when it advanced towards them and enveloped them. And it was so thick they
could barely see each other, even though they stood right next to each other. So they were unnerved by this, and they
walked out of it, and suddenly they broke free of this fog back into the sunlight. But all of them felt it was
strange and they talked about it until around noon at which point the boys departed for home. Francisco continued
walking and suddenly felt real tired and lay down next to a tree. He said
tiredness just completely overcame him and he felt instantly asleep. Now at one point sometime later
he opened his eyes and was puzzled to see darkness surrounding him. But he was too tired to wake up. That is until he
felt this strong pain in his shoulder. Now coming fully awake, he saw that it
was in fact nighttime, and he was shocked to see this tentacle-like appendage gripping his arm. He got up
and tried to free himself. He dropped his gun, found out he could only walk a few feet, and reaching down to grab this
appendage. He said it felt weird, spongy, flexible, smooth. Looking around
him, he saw a light to his right, and saw that this appendage was coming from a dark egg-shaped object in a horizontal
position. It was 120 ft long, 45 ft high, and standing next to it, he saw
the silhouette of a tall, slender figure. So, this thing that was holding his arm was attached to this object.
Thoroughly frightened, he felt a very sharp pain in his chest and passed out.
Upon awakening, he could hardly believe his eyes. He was in a large room, lying down on a kind of stretcher and what he
first thought was a hospital room. He said the room was completely silent. The temperature was comfortable. He saw
weird lights, strange looking alien instruments around him. One of these devices looked like a large kind of a
compass with weird symbols on it and it began to emit noise which sounded to
Francisco like voices speaking a foreign language. Then it became quiet and
suddenly colored lights began flashing in the room. So Francisco called out to
see if there was anybody in this room and this is when he heard a voice speaking in Spanish. Stay calm. We'll go
see you now. Don't be scared. Stay calm. So Francisco was still wondering if he
might be in a hospital. But about eight minutes later, a door slid open and three figures entered the room. He
assumed at first these would be human doctors, but they clearly were not human. So he now realized that he wasn't
in a hospital, that he must be inside this spacecraft. These three beings, he
said, looked humanoid. They were just over 5t tall, identical in appearance,
but they had hairless heads, a very tall forehead, a long large nose, thick lips
with the top lip being bigger than the bottom, and they had large protruding
egg-shaped eyes. He never once saw them blink. He said their skin was scaled
like a reptile. Each was wearing tight- fitting, shiny, silky looking gray
jumpsuits. So understandably, Francisco became quite nervous. Then that all
changed when one of the beings began to speak to him in a very kind manner. They
surrounded him on the stretcher and began to examine him, touching him on the head, face, and chest. They appeared
to take his pulse. One of them took a device from the wall and placed it on his chest. He said it was heavy and had
a small screen on the front of it. So this exam was quite brief. after which
Francisco started to ask questions. He first asked why the beings had taken him
and where they come from and were they going to take him away. They said no, he
was free to choose what he wanted to do, but that they had needed to do this physical exam. They said that they were
responsible for the strange fog he had seen early that morning and that they
examined him at that time. They said that their ship was made to travel specifically to Earth, but came from a
larger mother ship which was big enough to block the light from the sun. They said it could travel at great speed and
it took them only a few hours to travel from where they came from to Earth. They
said that their own galaxy was flaring up, requiring them to look for a new place to live. At this point, they gave
him a tour of the craft. They took them to a room which contained various plants that they were growing. They said that
they had mixed these plants with others to enhance their vitamin content. They
said their culture was much older than human culture. At one point they gave him something to eat, a type of
marmalade. They gave him a red liquid and a hot broth and told him that this
would provide enough nutrition to last a full day. They told him actually that his heart
had failed and that was the reason they had taken him on board and revived him.
They said that they were quote beings of light and benevolent in character. They
told him that humans were not benevolent and that if humans attempted to destroy their own planet, they would prevent
this. They told him that the compass-like device was artificial intelligence and controlled the ship,
that it was an intelligent computer. The ET said that they had learned our language by tapping into our own radio
transmissions. At one point, Francisco asked them, "Why don't you teach what you know to the planet?" And instead of
the ETSs responding, the compass-like device replied and said, "The people of Earth aren't ready to receive us yet. If
we do, we would trigger a warlike action, which would require us to respond and cause the deaths of many
innocent people. We are looking for a way to access your planet peacefully.
You must serve as a messenger transmitting what we have told you. They told him that when he heard three
beeping tones, that would be the time for him to reveal his story. The ETSs
then spoke and told him that the compass-like device actually prevented them from committing any warlike
behaviors on their part and would actually self-destruct if they, the ETs, exhibited any warlike behavior. They
told Francisco that they had placed a device in his body which would facilitate their ability to contact him
again. At one point he did look out the window and saw stars and what appeared to be another planet. At one point the
room became dark and then lit up again and the ET said that there had been something above them that necessitated
them hiding their presence from it. So they said that since he had now recovered from his apparent heart attack
when he fainted outside the craft, he would be returned. They took him outside
of the craft and put him back next to this tree. Saw it was still dark outside. They returned into the craft
which promptly rose upward, still maintaining a horizontal position. It
now made a sound, he said, like buzzing bees. rose about 12 feet up, tilted
diagonally, and took off at such great speed it became a point of light in the
sky and was gone. He tried to check the time, but discovered that his watch had stopped. He was dazed and disoriented,
so he hiked back into town. By the time he got there, dawn was breaking. His
family expressed alarm and concern that he had not returned and chided him for not informing them that he was staying
out all night, but he was too tired and dazed to speak about what happened to him. He skipped breakfast, went directly
to bed. His family woke him up around 2:00 p.m. Immediately, Francisco stood
up, screamed, and collapsed. So, they rushed him to the hospital. And doctors
had a hard time diagnosing him. They first thought he might be suffering from gout, but further examination revealed
that he had a weak heart. So, while he was in the hospital, he actually slipped into a coma for 3 days and then promptly
woke up. Doctors performed X-rays which did reveal a quote foreign body in his
chest. Also, one in the big toe of his right foot. The doctors told him that
they planned to remove this object inside his chest the next day, but right before the operation, they x-rayed him
again and this foreign body was gone. They did do an operation on his toe and
found this small object. As Francisco says, they extracted a small object
resembling a pellet. They asked me if I knew its origin. I said I didn't. Then
two men came and very astonished took it away. Francisco later learned that one of
these was an American. He asked for information about this object, but despite repeated requests, it was never
returned and he was never told anything about it. Doctors did tell him that his
body showed evidence of radioactive contamination. Francisco also noticed a
mark on his arm where this thing had grabbed him. But he says for the next 5
years he suffered from undiagnosed illness that actually left him unable to
work. Doctors asked him repeatedly if he had any idea what might be wrong with
him. But Francisco professed ignorance and refused to tell them about his UFO
encounter. At one point they gave him an EEG which showed abnormal readings to a
degree that for a while it gave him the impression that his brain was inactive
which obviously was not accurate. So his health suffered. He exhibited vision
problems, mild diabetes, rheumatism. He had another heart attack. The mark on
his arm which was normally pink would sometimes become purplish. And whenever
this happened, Francisco noticed a pattern. This was when his health problems would become
exacerbated. So doctors continued to ask him about the cause of his illness, saying, "If you could help us by telling
us what really happened to you, perhaps we could help you more effectively." But still, he refused to divulge his UFO
encounter. Finally, he did hear those strange beeping noises. And this is when he contacted researcher Pedro Maria
Fernandez. And Francisco told Pedro, "That's why I called you." So Francisco
was at first very tight-lipped about what had happened to him, but later revealed the whole story to the
investigator. Pedro conducted an extensive interview with him, which he later published in his book, The Unknown
Visitors. So there you go. Another very extensive onboard experience where the witness was able to hold long
conversations with these apparent extraterrestrials. Really so interesting
because the details he received from them are details that appear in so many
different cases. Many ETs have said we humans are simply not ready for open
official contact because of our warlike ways. Primarily that's the reason. But
so interesting makes me wonder how many people out there never talk about these
experiences because there's such a hostile climate of skepticism and ridicule out there. I suspect most
people do keep silent. Here's another case. I like this case a lot. It's a multiple witness
case. Super interesting. These witnesses were able to again hold long conversations. got some very very
interesting information from the ETSs. I call this one the most important
attribute of matter. This one occurred on September 20, 1979 in the small town of Stum,
Poland. And yeah, a multiple witness case. One of the witnesses was a
scientist. So he was able, I think, to ask some really interesting questions of
the ETSs. both actually asked questions and got answers as well. And it being a
multiple witness case always adds a level of credibility and also sort of
corroborating their experience is another encounter that occurred in this same exact area 1 year earlier. So yeah,
I think you'll find this one particularly interesting. This case was thoroughly investigated by Polish MUAN
representative Alio Popek and was published in the August 1980 issue of
the Muan Journal. It was also researched by others. This is a very interesting double witness fully conscious case of
an onboard UFO encounter. It occurred around 900 p.m. on September 20,
1979. The two witnesses were Miruslaw Goralski. He's an electronics engineer
and his friend Kristoff Kobas. He's a theater instructor. They were working in
Miruslaw's garden at his home located not far from Seni Wixa Street in Stum,
Poland. At the time of the encounter, Miruslaw was rinsing off his shovel and
Kristoff had stepped into the garden gazebo to light a cigarette. And this is
when suddenly Miruslaw heard a strange sound and at the same time felt a
alarming pressure and almost a choking sound in his throat. Looking up he saw
this silver metallic kind of delta-shaped craft floating at very low elevation above him. And his first
thought was that it was an airplane about to crash. and he screamed out, threw himself to the ground, and covered
his head with this shovel to protect himself from what he was sure was going to be an explosion. Now, at the same
time, Kristoff heard Miruslaw yelling and came running out to see what was wrong. And to his shock, he saw his
friend lying on the ground, and above him was a large object surrounded by
what looked to him like a ring of thick white fire, and it was slowly coming lower and lower down. At this point, the
environment suddenly became deathly quiet and this object lowered to a
height of about 20 feet. They estimate overhead. They could now see that it was
shaped kind of like two triangles facing each other with the bases facing each
other and the apexes at opposite ends. This was connected by a structure shaped
kind of like a plus sign. You can see their drawing here. It was silver gray, about 60 ft long, bigger than their
entire garden. But at this point, the object began to spin in place around its
axis and now took on the form of a discshaped craft. Mirror Slaw got up from the ground, and together the two
men stepped closer and looked up at this object. At this point, it became very bright, and both men immediately heard,
quote, a terrifying and unbearable high frequency. It was sort of echoing in
their heads, they said, and at the same time they found themselves illuminated by the light from this craft and
immediately engulfed by a sort of dense milky pink white fog. Both men found
themselves unable to move. Miruslaw said he had had the shovel in his hand, but
now it was gone. Now, at this point, Miruslaw said all his fear just left him
and was replaced by an almost euphoric feeling. He felt a strong force pressing
down on him and this was followed by the sensation of going up an elevator at
very high speed. Kristoff said that at this point his legs began shaking. He felt this strange force taking over his
body. He looked over at Miruslaw and saw that his face was distorted and his
knees were bent as if under the force of great gravity. And suddenly he realized that he was in a different place. no
longer in the garden but inside this sort of foggy realm that there were three cuboid or prismatic forms
appearing around him. He actually leaned on them and felt that they were solid but had a soft surface and suddenly he
felt almost like he was sitting in a comfortable armchair and as soon as he did so he started to receive telepathic
communications. All of these images entered his mind. He said there were various formulas, equations, and symbols
that appeared to be about mathematics, physics, and chemistry. He said it felt as though his mind had been taken over.
And he said he was quote totally petrified. Meanwhile, Miruslaw says that
the strange force surrounding him had dissipated and he realized he had been taken inside this craft, but still saw
the same weird fog around him. And he was very curious. So he began asking
questions. He said, "Who are you?" There was no response. He said, "What do you
represent?" Still no answer. Now being an electronics engineer, he asked, "What
do you know about integrated circuits, transistors, semiconductors?" This time the answer
came back. They said only one word, which was nothing. So he persisted with
his questions asking them, "What do you know about matter?" or what is matter?
And the answer was, you are insightful. The most important attribute of matter
is its ability to pervade other matter. So meanwhile, Kristoff still felt as if
he was sitting in this type of armchair. But now, instead of formulas and symbols
and equations entering his head, he said he saw a succession of various colors
flooding his mind. red, black, blue, yellow, others, and finally gray. He
said it felt almost as if his head was a computer as thoughts and ideas flowed
into his mind from some external source. At one point, he looked down to see what
he was sitting on and was surprised to see nothing there. He seemed to be levitating or floating. And like
Mirislaw, he did start asking questions, but they were answered not by words, but
by visual images. He said at one point he saw people in various oldfashioned
clothes and costumes from throughout ancient history. He looked over at Miruslaw at one point and watched him
turn and lean out of this foggy area at a steep angle as if leaning out of a
window to watch something. So Miruslaw says that after asking about the state of matter, the ETS asked him a question
saying what is this? And this is when Miruslaw leaned forward. exactly as
Kristoff had described, leaned through the fog outside and saw a screen showing
an image of his hometown Snoom from above. He could see the layout of the
city, the main street, the lakes around it, and he answered the question saying, "This is a city housing estate." And the
next thing he knew, he was abruptly deposited back into his garden, dropping almost a foot to the ground. At the same
moment, Kristoff felt as if the invisible chair he was sitting on had been pulled out from beneath him, and he
promptly fell on his bottom and rolled onto his back, finding himself lying down in the garden. Both men immediately
stood up, absolutely astonished, and saw the lights from this craft rapidly receding to the north. So, they stayed
at the location until morning, talking about what had happened to them. The next day they did tell their friends but
were not taken seriously. Both men said that afterwards they suffered from headaches. Finally looking for help they
contacted researchers and were subjected to numerous tests both physical and
psychological from a number of professionals. They were found to be sane, intelligent, stable, and honest.
They did later agree to go under hypnosis, which did not reveal any new details except for one tiny bit of
information. They remembered being shown some strange symbols. Investigators were absolutely convinced of the veracity of
this case. One reason was because one year and two weeks earlier in
1979, there was another remarkable UFO event in the same small town of Stum. At
the time, there were three ambulance workers, Dr. Barbara Piaza, the driver
Gregor's Scosinski, and the stretcherbearer, Andre Ol Oleuk. They
had just left the Stoom Hospital for the home of Elto Pluto in the nearby town of
Zutaka. She was in labor. So on the way there, Dr. Barbara Piazas pointed out a
big red sphere in the sky and said, "What would that be?" One of the men joked and said, "It's the notorious
UFO." This was a joke. They all laughed. They picked up their patient and headed back towards Stum. But as they passed
the town of Kalwa heading towards Stum, they saw that this object was not only still there, it was larger and getting
closer and lower in the sky. Before long, they saw it was at treetop level about 600 ft ahead of them. Now,
Gagores, who was driving, accelerated the ambulance and said that it was now pacing their vehicle. And as Dr. Piaza
says, "It seemed obvious to me that the object was under intelligent control. We
just could not lose it. It was racing after us." Then suddenly, as they
reached the railway between Kow and Stum, as you see here, they saw this object directly ahead of them,
apparently sitting on or just above the road. It appeared to be about 20 feet wide, overlapping each side of the road.
They could see kind of curved stripes on its surface. The patient Elsetto also saw it, but as she says, I
didn't pay much attention to the thing. Let UFOs be UFOs. I thought my problem
was how not to bear my baby in the ambulance. So, with this object now
blocking their forward progress, Dr. Piaza exited the ambulance and
approached the crossing station's guards. Their names were Josepha Kaminska and Gabriella Ludorf. They were
both leaning out of the window. The doctor asked them, "Can you see what I see?" And they replied, "We were looking
at it for a while." So, she radioed the police and told them that the roadway was blocked and could they please come.
And the police asked, of course, what's blocking the road? And she answered, "A UFO." So, at this point, the object
moved slightly up to the top of a small hill next to the road. Meanwhile,
Elbito's labor pains were coming at much shorter intervals, and Dr. Barbara Piaza
knew that they were running out of time, so she ordered the ambulance driver to flash the ambulance headlights at the
object. He flashed twice, and immediately this object moved forward,
became smaller, and vanished. It was now 4:15 a.m. they drove the remaining 10
minutes to the hospital and just under two hours later, Elbito Pluto gave birth
to her daughter, Anetta. Now, this case does have some skeptics and debunkers
because apparently uh there was a full moon or near full moon on this night and
they tried to explain away this sighting as the setting of the moon on the road in front of them. Disregarding
apparently the fact that this object was described as moving, pulsating at one point, showing curved bands on it, was
blocking the road, had moved off, shrank, and disappeared in seconds. Nevertheless, some feel that the
witnesses mistook the moon for a UFO. But perhaps I didn't know about this
report from a gentleman who says that the day before the situation described
above. I saw a similar ball over Rudlo near Branwa. It was evening, but still
very light. It could have been around 7:00 p.m. Together with my late father, we went fishing with the intention of
catching eel. We stopped on the Pasika River opposite the PM plant in Braniwa
and started to unwind our rods and at that time we saw an orange ball with two dark stripes in the sky was flying
slowly from the southeast to the northwest. It is difficult for me to assess the size, distance from us and
speed of this object, but we observed the object for about one or two minutes until it disappeared behind the horizon.
Later I read about the same object seen in the vicinity of Stum. How cool is
that? Two people being taken on board and given all kinds of scientific information and more. And this second
case with, you know, the crew of an ambulance having a very very close
encounter with a UFO that blocked their path forward on the road. And I know
there are those skeptics who say that no, what they saw was just the setting moon. To me, that makes me laugh because
I just cannot imagine an a medical doctor and an ambulance driver and, you
know, the other medical worker being fooled by the setting moon in front of them on the road. And besides, the
details don't match that whatsoever. They said this object was moving around. They watched it shrink and disappear
instantly. Uh, I don't think this was the moon despite what the debunkers say.
But again, I wasn't there. Neither were they. Only the witnesses truly know what
happened. And that's true, of course, in this next case, which is perhaps one of Ukraine's most famous onboard UFO
encounters. This one got quite a bit of publicity. I hadn't heard of it until I started researching this case. So
interesting. This one I call we won't do you any harm. This occurred on January
12, 2008 in Dubnau, Ukraine. This is such a fascinating case because the
entire family saw the UFO prior to the husband and wife both being taken on
board. It's a very extensive encounter containing almost all the elements we
see when people are taken on board. Also super interesting is they how they were
affected physically as we shall see. Very well investigated as well. This one
is really hard to deny that something truly amazing happened to this Ukrainian
couple. Was on January 12th, 2008 that the Voronki family of Dubnau in the
Robno region of Ukraine experienced a really remarkable encounter. The family
consisted of 34year-old Vladimir. He's a martial arts instructor, a professional
wrestler, and his 29-year-old wife Olga, and their three children, Vanessa, age
nine, Angelica, age 8, and Arthur, who was one years old. At this time, Olga
was suffering from chronic colitis, which was causing her pain in her stomach area. She'd had it for years
now. On that day, Vanessa and Angelica had come home from a trip to the store
and told their parents that they had seen quote a flying star. Their mother said they probably saw a satellite or a
plane. The girls protested and said this object was actually flashing colored lights and they insisted that their
parents come outside and see it for themselves. So, they did. And they saw this strange object high in the sky over
the nearby river. They could see it moving and changing shapes. In fact, Olga took a picture of it on her cell
phone. Then they went inside. But as Vladimir says, I saw what looked like
three bullets hovering in the sky. I thought they were satellites. That evening, in the middle
of the night, Vladimir was woken by a bright white violet light illuminating the interior of their house. He didn't
think much of it and went back to sleep. But then Olga woke up and saw it, too. So she woke up, Vladimir saying, "Get
up. There's something glowing over the house. And their child, Angelica, saw
it, too. All three of them now saw that the ceiling of their bedroom had disappeared or had become completely
transparent. And hovering directly over their house was this huge discshaped
craft. So, dressed only in their bedclo, Vladimir and Olga ran outside. And as
Olga says, there was something like a platform hanging 100 m above the house.
A white and purple light was streaming from it. We were so scared that we couldn't move. Both Olga and Vladimir
found themselves immobilized. Olga said she felt herself being pulled upward.
And Vladimir says he actually saw his wife rising up in a spiral motion towards the craft. He tried to catch
her, but at the same time found himself suddenly inside this strange white room
with his wife. He said this room was totally white with smooth glass-like walls and there were about a dozen short
humanoids standing around them. He said that they had large heads, smooth gray
skin, three fingers on each hand. They were wearing tight coveralls and what looked like face masks. The only thing
he could really see were large black eyes. He did see one entity was about
six feet tall, twice the height of the others. He said their legs looked really strange and they seemed to float around
rather than walk. Immediately, Olga was put in a chair, which she said was similar to one seen in a gynecological
office. Vladimir jumped up to protect his wife, but he says he hit quote an
invisible wall. So concerned, he asked these figures, "What's going on?" And they replied telepathically, "Nothing
terrible. Soon you will be back home." and he said, "I'm not satisfied with
that." The ETSs tried to approach him several times. Vladimir being a martial
artist used these techniques to keep them away. And speaking telepathically
in a mixture, he says, of Ukrainian and Russian, they spoke to him asking him
why he was resisting. And as Vladimir says, the words sounded in my head. They
looked me in the eye. They were not aggressive or irritated. So after lashing out at them several times, he
says the ETSs placed this sort of metallic device on his chest area and rendered him totally unable to move.
They indicated a table and told Olga to lie down on it. And as Olga says, they
were polite and addressed me as you. They asked how I felt and if it hurt. So
she laid down on this table and she watched as these ETs mysteriously opened up a wide incision into her abdomen. He
said she could see the inside of her body and actually smell it and they began to poke around at various organs
using this strange pincher-like instrument. And during this time the figure spoke to her telepathically
calming her asking her if she felt any pain and they said we wouldn't do you
any harm. We just want to look. So Olga was struck by their polite bedside
manner. And as she says, I didn't feel any pain. I felt calm and relaxed. It
was as if they were taking tests. They used these strange instruments which Olga found impossible to accurately
describe. Uh afterwards, they sewed up her stomach as mysteriously as they opened it. There was no trace, no scar
of the incision. One of the ETs then spoke with Vladimir, telling him that
their society was a collective and that each person had strictly defined social
roles. This told him that they lived largely underground. Sometimes they communicated using images rather than
words, so it was hard for him to understand some of this. Vladimir says that he was also examined with a
rod-like device, which he says the ETSs seem to insert into his head, though
this did not cause him any pain. The ETSs told him that Olga's procedure has
to be done and they apologized for the quote medical suffering and promised
them an excursion, a voyage as compensation for this. At this point,
they placed both he and Olga in a smaller craft with a transparent top.
This left the mother ship, and Vladimir and Olga were amazed to see stars and a
strange foreign planet below them. Vladimir asked them how they were a able to travel so quickly through space and
the ET said that they did not exceed the speed of light but instead were able to tear space. Vladimir was unable to fully
understand all of this. One of the ETs said that Vladimir now knew too much and
that they could not return him. This made him very angry and he said he was not afraid of them and this seemed to
make the ETSs act in a much more respectful manner. The ETSs also told
Vladimir that they were very interested in humans because of their emotions. And as Vladimir says, we are interesting to
them because we have feelings, fear, anger, love, joy. The aliens don't have
that. At one point, they tried to persuade Vladimir to procreate with one of their females. He refused because
this female ET was not attractive to him. him. She had a bald head and he
says looked ugly. At this point, the ET changed its appearance into that of a
beautiful woman. Vladimir felt like they had read his mind and were portraying his idea of an ideal woman, and he did
find himself attracted to her and began to move forward with this. But now, however, Olga saw this and protested.
The ETS seemed confused and asked her why and she had to explain to them about her feelings of jealousy. The ETSs were
surprised at this and asked them how they survived with such emotions. So they told him all kinds of things that
there was a war going on in space. Vladimir asked about death and they said
that it did not exist, that it was misunderstood and that it was just a transition into a different form of
existence. They talked about God. They said that there were people on our planet against
God and were trying to cover up information and that the Earth would soon be destroyed. At some point,
Vladimir and Olga looked outside and could see the craft moving back towards Earth. They said they were put on a
smaller craft which went down and hovered above their home and they were both deposited back into their beds via
a beam of light. They woke up the next morning with headaches. Both had conscious recall of the experience, but
it was dreamlike and they wondered if they were going crazy. And at first, they didn't talk about it. But later,
Olga did start talking about this quote strange alien dream she had. And Vladimir was shocked cuz he recalled the
exact same details as his wife and both realized that this was not a dream at all. It was real. In February 2008,
Vladimir met with researcher Yuri Steppenov, who regressed them, and Vladimir was able to recall some further
details about the appearance of the craft and how it is able to become invisible by surrounding itself with a
layer of plasma. And Yuri was absolutely convinced of the case and said, "Vladimir is telling the truth." And
there's good evidence that this did happen because most incredible were the physiological effects which resulted
from this encounter. Vladimir's hair, which was going gray, started to turn
black again. And he said his physical powers of endurance increased greatly.
As he says, "It is easier for me to perform complex jumps and turns. I do
not stretch my muscles. My skin has become much tougher." Olga was also physically affected. She
was completely cured of her chronic colitis and she also acquired a very
unique and strange ability. She says that by just placing the palm of her
hand against her own forehead or the forehead of somebody else for about two or three minutes, she could make a
drunken person completely sober. The couple did eventually go public, appearing on a TV show, and they were
soon ridiculed by neighbors and other skeptics, but they stuck to their stories. They did say that the ETSs told
them they would return in 2 years, but whether or not this occurred has not
been revealed. When Vladimir went on TV, this was in 2012, he did subject himself
to a lie detector test, which he passed with flying colors. He was telling the
truth according to this lie detector test. Absolutely astonishing. I mean,
both the husband and wife being affected physically in so many different ways,
him becoming stronger, his gray hair turning brown again, she being cured of
colitis that she had been suffering from for years, and gaining other really amazing psychic abilities. These are
patterns we see in a number of these cases. But how interesting being given a tour of the craft, you know, beyond that
as well and him passing a lie detector test. I think it's a really important
case. I think all of these are these again are the kinds of cases that really
have so much information, have so much to teach us about who's out there beyond
Earth. Uh these cases, I think, teach us so much about science. I mean, they have
the potential to really advance our knowledge on so many fronts. That's, I
think, why these cases are so important and really should be taken seriously. To
me, onboard UFO encounters represent the cutting edge of UFO research, and I
would just wish more attention would be paid towards them and that they were taken more
seriously and that the skeptics and debunkers would just at least take a
look at the evidence because often they don't. They will not even consider that
these cases might be valid. But to me, there are so many that that
alone is the best evidence of this. It's not just one or two people reporting this or 10 or 20 or 100. It's thousands
upon thousands. And there are indications that these kinds of cases number in the millions. So there you go.
Five really extensive cases coming from all over the world from people who don't
know each other yet are reporting remarkably similar details.
So, thank you once again for watching. I hope you enjoyed this episode, perhaps
learned something. There a lot more cases like this. This is an important subject. I think it has the potential to
change all of humanity and really bring us together. Thank you again. I really
appreciate it. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. Most important
of all, keep having fun. I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
