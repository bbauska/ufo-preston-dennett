TWO SCHOOLYARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Nov 5, 2021

Summary:
Nov 5, 2021
There are several very famous incidents involving Schoolyard UFO Encounters. The Ariel Elementary 
School Incident in Ruwa, Zimbabwe; the Westall High School Incident in Melbourne, Australia; the 
Broadhaven Elementary School Incident in Wales; the Crestview Elementary School incident in Opa-
Locka, Florida; and the Hillsdale College incident, in Hillsdale, Michigan (to name a few!) But 
what many people don't know is that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg. There are well 
over 100 documented cases of UFOs hovering over schools. Not only hovering, but in about 1/3 of 
the cases, the UFOs land and/or humanoids are seen.

This video presents two incredible cases, both which occurred in May of 1977, separated by four 
days and less than 100 miles. Unlike the above cases, these received zero publicity, and were 
very nearly lost to history. In this video, you will hear the testimony from the fathers of two 
young schoolgirls who were firsthand witnesses to a Schoolyard UFO Encounter.

The first case took place on May 2, 1977, at an un-named elementary school in Downey, California. 
The case involves a very low-level sighting, has multiple witnesses and some very unusual effects. 
The second case took place on May 6, 1977 at Ocean Knoll Elementary school. It involves humanoids 
and an apparent landing. 

Schoolyard UFO Encounters have been occurring since at least 1950, and are still occurring today. 
These are not normal sightings. Unlike your average encounter, these cases are almost exclusively 
daylight encounters, very low level, long-lasting and involve many, many witnesses. ETs are 
targeting schools in an apparent agenda to announce their presence to the world in a very subtle 
way. The question is, why?

hundred others, check out my book, "Schoolyard UFO Encounters: 100 True Cases." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode two schoolyard ufo encounters i've been studying 
schoolyard ufo encounters for some time i've documented more than 100 cases and I find 
these types of cases particularly fascinating they are absolutely different from your average 
encounter which is usually an anomalous light seen late at night darting by 
pretty high overhead and moving off these cases are significantly different in a number of ways 
typically schoolyard ufo encounters occur during the day these are daylight encounters 
secondly these settings are very low level a few hundred feet and in fact in one third of the cases 
they are landings in which often humanoids are seen thirdly these are long lasting sightings also 
what makes them different from your average sighting is they are widely viewed large crowds of people and often teachers as well see these objects what I find also fascinating is 
that of the hundred schoolyard ufo encounters i've documented over half involve elementary schools 
so the reason I wanted to do this episode today because I have covered schoolyard ufo encounters 
in previous episodes is that in these two cases I have recordings from the witnesses 
fathers the witnesses in both these cases were very young elementary age
girls very young witnesses and in each of these cases their fathers reported their case firsthand 
so what i'd like to do is actually play the recordings of these interviews which I think is far more interesting than just me talking about them but hearing directly from 
the witnesses fathers themselves the first case took place on may 2 
1977 over the city of downey california I don't know the exact school where this took place 
but it was in downey a fairly densely populated area this occurred at around 11 a.m and was 
witnessed by a large group of elementary age school children it's a fascinating case 
and i'll just let the father of the witness talk about it in his own words so let's take a listen
have you received any reports uh monday on a ufo sighting in the downey the area or woody area or 
lakewood area no sir did you see something well my little girl and her classmates saw it and then I 
found well this is monday when they saw they were playing at a school and then I heard from other 
people uh who also uh my mother-in-law who teaches uh different people in her class were talking 
about it but my little girl and her classmates got the uh they it came right down over their school 
and uh they were able to uh make drawings of it and uh this was monday around oh I guess around 11 
o'clock 11 30 and uh we're in a apartment complex right practice practically right behind the school 
and uh on monday at I say between 11 11 30 a vibration uh kind of started in the apartment 
uh in which we're we're living I don't know if it was felt throughout the rest of the units but anyway the department in which we're living start to vibrate and i've been 
connected too until she told us the uh told us of this uh well she described it and she told us 
that evening monday evening about it and I happen to think of that vibration which I couldn't 
account for because when it started when it when it started I it wasn't caused by anything I could 
relate it to and so so anyway I was curious because she uh she wasn't the first one to see it 
some of her classmates saw and then then our little girl saw it and she said and she and 
she was able to make this drawing of it and um the stories uh you know the stories all all cooperate 
so I called the school and they uh to ask if there was any if the children had been talking about 
it and they said no no they not to their knowledge but they did talk to the the girls I saw it
okay what uh what kind of description did they give well the way the way five it it was that they 
were playing and uh in the schoolyard and it's the elementary school and they the one classmate 
called the other other children's attention to it and she said it was like a big silver ball 
and she said it was she said it was as bright as as the sun seemed to be as bright as the sun it was coming and it was over the school and on that on that day monday it was the visibility 
here was perfect the sky was blue there was there were no clouds and uh and it was a 
unusually clear condition there was no smog and she said that and she said it's like a big silver ball and then she said it was surrounded by rings of color 
and she said it was like trying to come down to us and she then said in the center of it there 
appeared another bright sun she says a real bright sun in the center of it and that got real bright 
and at that point they became frightened so I said how large was it she said it was about as large as 
a street well ximena's as large as a street is wide I guess right and we took it to the school and and on the school playground like they had these um 
areas more stenciled out on the on a paving for games and so forth and there's a very large circle 
and the circle must be at least 30 feet in diameter and I said no was it as large as 
this circle she said oh yeah she's bigger than that and she said they stayed there and it was 
watching them she pushed she said it was watching them so I said well what happened then she said well the school bell rang and we went in and she said I looked over my shoulders to look at it 
again and she said she said it will probably come back tomorrow so we questioned the other girls and 
the story is the same with them and uh it's a dandish thing so my mother-in-law was at class 
the other day and they were talking about uh about something I don't know exactly what 
they were talking about more that's the same thing you know a ufo sighting and um so I call the police department to see if there are any reports but it was this was monday 
night now so she said you'd have to call back earlier tomorrow so and they gave me your number 
so the thing that puzzles me is that that the kids were able to describe this thing and oh 
yeah they were I said well what were these rings coming out from it she said well they were like the colors in the rainbow and then she said she said no she said they were colored but 
they weren't like the rainbow but there were two rings and they came out from it and I said now this bright sun that came out out of the center of it I said was it bill all the 
time she said no she says when it wasn't there before there was just like a big gray area so 
it's a it's just an amazing thing and then this vibration that we felt in the apartment complex 
happened had to happen at the same time because I connected the two and they were at recess 
around 11 11 30 between 11 11 30 and that's when this vibration started and I don't it only lasted for I would say the vibration only lasted for all um
10 10 or 15 seconds at the most 
so uh so I i think it's I think it's uh it's just uh it was just something that I you know
i'm surprised that uh others at the school didn't see it but I haven't really gone over there I was going to take the drawings that these uh little girls made and take them over 
and ask perhaps if someone maybe an adult teacher or someone else might have seen it
did they see the object leave no they all went into the um they all went back into 
the classroom oh I see yeah and she said when she looked over her shoulder it was still there
okay did they give any estimate of how high that thing was yeah yeah I was trying to I was trying to I was trying to uh have her it's given me an idea and 
i uh we were looking at some polls some high polls and it would be my guess she pointed to a really high pole and it would be my guess it was uh 
oh at least several hundred feet maybe several hundred feet off the ground but from but from 
the way she describes it as large as she described it like this circle are trying
yeah yeah see see see my wife was saying that after she drew the picture 
we have a film can here it's like a can they put film in and I said uh 
well well the funny part of it was when they did the drawings I said now you draw what it looked like so she drew her classmates on the ground on a separate piece of paper and 
the playground was the trees and swings and she named each of her friends and and then uh she drew 
on another piece of paper the round object and she drew it perfectly round and around the the perimeter she put these two rings that were coming out from it and then right in the center she drew 
a a smaller circle which she colored yellow so she was trying to I was looking at her she 
didn't know I was watching her but she was told because she put the piece of paper that had the 
the object on it above the piece of paper that had her she and her classmates playing and uh 
and she wasn't and she wasn't uh she knew she wasn't quite getting it the way she wanted it so 
my wife put the paper on when she drew the object at right angles and she says yes she says that's 
that's how it was like right above us so then we held up this film can and we said now was it solid 
looking like this was it metallic looking she says yes she says with silver and metallic looking 
and uh so the size of it if it was as if it was larger than this circle it had to be quite low 
because this circle as I said is at least 30 feet in in diameter 
so she gave us good a description of it of something that you could uh certainly ever 
ever hope for did they hear any sound no I asked her and she says no there was no sound but and 
when she said when we asked that there was there was any sound she said there was no sound that's when I kicked next that's when I remember the vibration okay and so whatever that vibration was 
it was uh it was very unsettling the vibration when it when it started it was really unsettling 
because it was like a high intensity vibration and that is the decision things weren't rattling 
it was like a very high uh um oh however you might describe it things are just like like humming
okay and how old was she
after if the rest of her classmates saw and she said uh well she didn't know because they were looking up at it but she uh she wasn't the first one to see it was her friend and then about four 
of her friends were all looking up at it she said and and and she said they were looking straight up at it so she trained her put her head back and it had to be almost directly overhead 
okay did they actually see this thing descending towards them or was it stationary I i don't know I 
don't know when this uh when thought I would have to I would have to ask her that did she uh mention 
how many were in that group of children about I would say about four or five okay yeah she knows 
them by name because I guess they all they're all the same age do you still have those drawings 
oh yeah yeah we have the drawings and they're uh they're really they're you know they're really 
uh they're humorous because the way she does the the relationship with the children and then they uh and then this object okay is there any possibility of getting those oh sure sure 
be happy so get a letter off to you about that all right sir we sure appreciate this report and 
we're going to check into this right away and see if we can't come up with some information on it 
and uh it's uh the object which she has described where you described to me 
would fit the category of what we refer to as the saturn type object the sphere 
surrounded by uh rotating bands or colored bands right down through the center
and uh it comes as a surprise that this uh took place in broad daylight like this because this usually doesn't happen
but we're going to uh we'll check into it anyway see if we can't come up with some more information and uh if we get it we'll get back to you and let you know okay 
okay well thank you now thank you very much as you can see it's a truly fascinating case with some very unusual elements and that brings us to 
the second case which is really remarkable because as it turns out this second case took place 
in encinitas california on may 6 1977. that's just four days after the first sighting and about 85 
miles to the south that's highly coincidental that these are so close in time and space 
another very interesting aspect about this setting is we know the exact school it's at ocean knoll 
elementary school both these areas where these sightings have occurred are right along the 
southern california coast which is very active in terms of ufos so that might also be a factor here 
but the second case is particularly compelling because it involves two sightings humanoids 
were seen and apparently this craft landed and remained in place for about an hour it's truly a 
fascinating case which should be far more well known than it is so let's just listen to the 
father of the witness in this second case at ocean knoll elementary school in encinitas california
yes sir i'm calling for the ufo reporting center in washington oh yes and we had an unnamed caller left a message at our office today regarding uh something that 
you were supposed to have seen several days ago uh where are you calling from seattle washington oh 
no that was my son left you that I see no that was I didn't see it myself this happened about 
a block away from where I live about 15 school children saw it and the teacher oh I see and 
one of the school children was my daughter that's how it came to mind what was a wonderful fighting jesus the thing hung there for five minutes and all the kids just stared at it 
uh do you want me to tell you about it yes sir we'd like to hear all about it well there's a little canyon behind you know where anthony this is no sir well I do buy the map 
about 20 or 30 miles north of san diego okay right along the ocean it's like so our children 
go to a school called ocean and there's a small canyon behind it right behind the school and uh 
at 8 30 they saw this thing go down in that canyon now whether it ever landed there or just hovered 
down in here I don't know and they were trying to climb there was a fence around the play yard 
of course and they couldn't get out of the play yard but they were trying to climb the fence so they could look down and decay it but they couldn't see it and then an hour later at 9 
30 this thing came up out of the canyon and just hovered right at eye level where they could look right in the windows and everything see the people inside
and it just it just hovered there for about five minutes and and finally it raised up and 
it came over and it circled the schoolyard and uh with all the kids looking at it 
and then it they say it disappeared just by going right straight up in the air or disappeared out of sight now the strange thing about this whole thing they run in and tell 
their teacher what they saw and the teacher said just forget it forget you saw anything and uh I can't understand that mentality they just baffled me even and the teacher that stood there 
and saw it with him told the kids to forget they saw anything right well we run into this 
yes it just didn't it baffles me and arranges me at the same time that they would tell my 
you know to see a ufo was one of the sites seeing a century one of the great sites if you're lucky 
enough to see one and then my daughter saw one and told you know told to forget about it right uh how old was your daughter he's ten yeah that's a good observing age yeah and there was a girl 
that had a pair of binoculars just had a beard they were gonna watch birds or something and she watched his things through binoculars and we went over the house to see her and because the teacher 
was we didn't see her now she wasn't there but my wife saw her later that day in the store and she went oh he said tell us about the ufo dude I didn't see anything we didn't see anything 
and the girl was probably the best that saw the thing best of all you know but turned off by the 
teacher's attitude and another little boy that was all excited about it and everything like 
his reaction was the same thing uh that wasn't nothing but at the time my daughter was telling 
me he was all excited he knew what a ufo was and everything but that they turned them off on it did 
you run into that all the time oh yes not sure do you remember the exact date on that yeah it was uh 
friday a week ago in the morning i'd had to get a counter thank you that would be a 
week ago last friday this last friday yeah that's right yeah that's right now these
the real story is to get these kids together and get them within let them tell you what they saw but it was uh we did talk to some other kids that that uh thought 
there was about five kids in one family and they were all excited about it and uh and I tried to 
collaborate what everyone said you know I didn't make any noise and didn't make any noise but they 
one boy insisted he didn't make any noises but my daughter says it did make a noise like a slight 
roar you know but they all agreed on the color and they all agreed that it had windows in the side they all agreed that you could look in and see people inside I say people and they said that 
the one boy said they look like the head mask over their faces and my little girl said they look like 
their faces were all rough like funny observation you know yeah but they they generally agreed where 
it was what it did and how it disappeared they agreed on that you know it just it circled over 
the schoolyard and just went right on straight up in the air and they never saw it again now this is a ufo this is no helicopter or an airplane because my little girl has seen thousands 
of them you know she could possibly have okay what kind of description did you give of this vehicle 
silver silver silver and she said it daddy looked just like a plate it was flat on 
the bottom and round on the top so you put the traditional saucer thing you know right and uh 
and it had and they made another observation here that as it caught the light of the sun 
uh certain parts of it would just flash brilliantly now whether that was just the 
they seem to think it was a reflection from the sun on some reflectors that were on the object itself you know right but it flashed brilliantly and it had lights on it yellow 
blue light on it that blinked and that object actually came up over the schoolyard 
came up yeah but the best observation was when it come out this little canyon behind I went down in that canyon i'm disabled right now and i'm on crutches and I couldn't really 
get around very good down there and it we covered about maybe one-fourth of the canyon the next 
the next two days trying to see if we can see anything down there you know but like it's so bushy and hard to get around there I really couldn't go over it right
you take a table body you know two or three able-bodied men could go over that in an hour right yeah right because it's just a small can just a little thing okay did your 
daughter make any drawings or sketches yeah he did make me a little drawing yeah I asked her to draw me in we had her I guess she still got it I don't know what's around here 
what was her first name her first name okay and how many witnesses or kids do you think there with at least 15 kids 
and the teacher and the teacher I know her name uh but I forgot that right now okay anyway but you know I i called the san diego paper 
they had no interest in it at all I called channel 8 which is the local tv and they had no interest 
in at all I i felt society I was disappointed I thought it was fine that society was more sophisticated at this time on that sort of thing but they they're hung up on their old fears I 
guess like they always did you know something you don't understand forget it right well this is 
very interesting and as much as we had a somewhat similar incident happen near downey 
on the first monday earth the second monday the second of may up and down yeah right uh 
yeah right the object came down right over the schoolyard right in the middle of recess it did well the same thing happened here yeah and how was that described just as a very bright 
silver object they couldn't make out any real uh structural uh parts of the object 
of the brilliant light and of course the in this particular case the students they got quite panic 
stricken and ran into the school and uh by the time they looked back out again the thing had gone 
what day was that was that anywhere near the friday that uh it was may 2nd monday may 2nd so that was in the same week right that's interesting 
but they didn't have the same situation there where the teachers told the kids not there or maybe they were my knowledge not when I talked to the one of the girl's father and uh he had 
pretty well quizzed his daughter regarding the incident and he was going to get in contact with 
other parents whose children were involved and see if they couldn't correlate all the information was that were they older what grade were they yeah grade school basically elementary huh 
right yeah this is elementary to you up to sixth grade I think his daughter was about seven and a 
half oh something like that and uh how how many people saw it how many children saw it 
i don't remember the group but it was pretty large group of kids she's only five days away huh they saw it on monday and then this thing was seen again on that same friday what in the world 
it would do what would be doing down in that canyon for an hour do you have any ideas well 
of course gordon down in the canyons like that is quite common for these vehicles but what is really important is the fact that uh the incident occurred during daylight hours which is very rare 
yeah oh was the other one in the evening or something no that was 11 o'clock in the morning
we're getting out of the way radar huh oh and down there they my daughter remembers that it 
was exactly an hour because she saw it and she remembered they come out for recess at 9 30 again 
and then when it come up out of the canyon she happened to see achieve their kids all stood there with their mouth hanging open okay if we got a questionnaire off to you could you kind of uh 
work with your daughter to fill that in yeah i'd like to also if we could get some investigators 
in there would you kind of operate as the hub to get them started I would be glad to cooperate with 
anybody it just infuriates me that they they're gonna just uh you know ignore the whole thing 
where did your son finally get our number I gave it though department and they gave me your number 
right but since I don't have so much I don't have very much money right now uh I didn't call because I found out it was out of town I just couldn't afford it so 
he had more money to give me a number i'll call it so he did that's how that happened but if you want to send anybody around i'd be glad to cooperate with shoulder where it is in the canyon 
was there any estimated distance between the witnesses and the object I uh I estimate that I don't think it could have been over a hundred foot they were right on top of 
things staring right into it yeah you know it would you know the average flight as you know 
the average flying saucer or ufo sighting is uh we saw two objects fight at approximately five 
thousand feet going northwest or something right well they're valueless they're this is a wonderful 
sighting the ground level and and they're gonna just ignore it I can't believe it well we'll get 
somebody in there to dig that out I wish you would I don't have the time or I can't do it because i'm 
disabled but i'll cooperate i'd love to cooperate with you well we sure appreciate that very much 
okay and thank you again for talking to me are you is this the hub or ufo
uh scientific organization working on this subject oh is that right right it's not in any way associated with the government oh it's all by public I mean 
it's a self-funded funded organization right yeah good all right i'm glad to hear it i'll 
send somebody around we'll dig that story out i'd like to do that thank you very much you better
there you go that's the second case I think you'll agree it's truly fascinating to hear 
from the witnesses fathers themselves uh and uh I love these cases because I think 
these are typical of schoolyard ufo encounters I think the reason there are so many of these cases 
is that there is an agenda the ETs are targeting schools on purpose intentionally showing 
themselves to the youngest of our children I do have cases involving junior high school 
students high school students even college but as I mentioned earlier over half involve elementary 
age students and I think that's intentional I think the ETs are showing themselves to children 
in an effort to sort of announce their presence get us used to their presence and the reason I think they're doing that is because one day we will have open official 
contact I think we're moving towards that and it could happen very soon anyway these are 
fascinating cases I covered them both and nearly a hundred more in my book schoolyard ufo encounters 
this is a phenomena that has been occurring since at least 1950. I have one case earlier than that 
but it's still going on today i'm quite confident there will be more cases i'm still hearing of 
new ones and these are a really interesting type of encounter that really deserve to be 
well known and that's why I wanted to do this video this episode I hope you've enjoyed it 
i want to thank you once again for watching I really appreciate it and until next time 
keep asking questions keep searching for answers and most importantly keep having fun.
