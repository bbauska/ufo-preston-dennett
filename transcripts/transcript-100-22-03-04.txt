AN ALIEN IMPLANT
Mar 4, 2022

Summary:
Mar 4, 2022
In 2012, Nancy (pseudonym), a single parent from a small town in Indiana, took her 14-year-old son, Anthony, (pseudonym) to the dentist for his annual cleaning, check-up and dental x-rays. Unknown to her, the x-rays showed the presence of a strange unknown object in her son's jaw. They went to the dentist each year, but it wasn't until three years later, in 2015, that they were scheduled for another series of x-rays. On this occasion, the dentist revealed that the x-rays indicated the presence of a metallic FB (foreign body) in her son's jaw, beneath his lower left molar. There was no evidence of any entry wound, and the tooth was healthy, pain-free, and asymptomatic. The dentists were utterly baffled and unable to explain the presence of this mysterious object.

So began Nancy and Anthony's search for answers. The problem was, there were no explanations, except for one. And the explanation was so outlandish that Nancy wasn't sure if she could accept it. Everywhere she looked, the words "alien implant" kept appearing. When Nancy questioned her son about it, he admitted that he had, in fact, had a close encounter with a UFO. He was also having dreams about aliens.

Nancy was amazed. She had always known her son was special. As a very young child, he used to see spirits. As he grew, he began to display many powerful psychic abilities, and would daily experience precognition, clairvoyance and incredible synchronicities. And now there was the UFO sighting. Could this all be connected?

It was shortly before the first x-ray was taken in 2012. Anthony and his friend were walking outside at night when a strange cluster of blue and yellow lights appeared in the sky. The lights dropped down low over their heads and began flashing bright colors. He and his friend were both convinced it was a genuine UFO. 

Nancy now found herself obsessed. She needed to know exactly what was happening with her son. Then, on the evening of May 5, 2017, Nancy had an encounter with gray aliens. She watched as one gray stood by the bedroom door, and two other grays began working Anthony. One of the grays told her telepathically that she did not need to worry about her son. "Do not be afraid," he told her. "Everything is okay. We are not here to hurt you. Everything is going to be okay." 

When morning arrived, Nancy told Anthony what happened, and that she felt a huge sense of relief. Both wondered if his apparent alien implant was still there. They were scheduled to have another set of x-rays in a few weeks, so they were eager to see. 

When they arrived at the dentist's office, he took two x-rays. The first one showed that the mysterious object was still there. But the second x-ray, taken about 30 seconds after the first one, showed that the implant had disappeared. Shocked, the dentist took a third x-ray free of charge. To everyone's amazement, the implant was back! One of the dental technicians was so upset by the mystery, she had to leave the room.

Events were still in progress. Around this time, Nancy began to have recall of her own encounters, reaching back all the way to childhood, when she discovered a mysterious "lump" in her nasal cavity. She also had vivid memories of grays visiting her throughout her life.

Then, in November of 2018, Nancy was taken onboard a UFO. To her amazement, the interior of the UFO was "dressed up" to look very much like a living room, complete with couch, chair, a TV and cheap carpet. But she was sure she was on a craft, especially after a nine-foot-tall praying mantis ET entered and began to perform a procedure on her and someone else who was also onboard the craft.

Nancy had no fear. She feels confident that the ETs mean her no harm. And both she and Anthony have accepted the fact that they are UFO contactees. Still, they prefer to keep this aspect of their lives private and have elected to remain anonymous. They just want to live their lives normally.

Today Nancy and Anthony are moving on with their lives. Anthony is still having daily psychic experiences. But they, like his implant, have become a normal part of his life.

This video presents the true story of Nancy's and Anthony's encounters with aliens. If you would like to explore more about their amazing experiences, and many others, check out my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters." Now available!

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode an alien implant this is the true story of a single mother and her teenage son 
who found out that they are ufo contactees it's a very unusual story with what appears to be hard 
physical proof of an alien implant and it's got some very interesting details and this is why I 
wanted to present this case to you today I call the mother nancy and the son anthony this is not 
their real names they prefer to remain anonymous they come from a small town in indiana which again 
they do not want named they're very private about this they just want to live normal lives but their 
story begins really on march 1st 2012 when nancy took anthony to the dentist at the time anthony 
was 14 years old and this was just a normal checkup cleaning and x-rays and everything went 
fine as far as they knew nothing abnormal happened they went home and next year they went to the 
dentist had just a cleaning and a checkup as they do each year next year after that 
another cleaning and checkup but it wasn't until three years later on August 11, 2015 
that they were scheduled to have x-rays again and this is when they found something very unusual. 
Anthony sat in the dental chair went had his cleaning had the checkup and x-rays were taken 
and as the x-rays were being examined by the dentist uh he became very concerned and he called 
over another dentist and then another and soon all seven dentists in the clinic were looking at these 
x-rays with obvious concern meanwhile nancy's sitting in the waiting room and she can see into 
the office because there's a window and she motions to her son anthony what is going on 
anthony shrugs he doesn't know at this point he hasn't seen the x-rays but then the dentists call nancy into the office itself and they ask anthony and nancy has anthony 
ever shot himself in the mouth with the bb gun and of course they both deny it and they show 
them the x-rays that they had taken which show the presence of what appears to be a bb-like object 
underneath one of anthony's molars on the left bottom side and they told nancy we found something 
in your son's mouth it's underneath the tooth it looks like a bb but we don't see any imperfections 
there's no scarring no evidence of any entry wound we have no explanation for what it is 
anthony nancy denied ever sh having you know had a bb gun in the house anthony 
never got shot in the mouth uh this simply did not happen and there was no entry wound 
the tooth was asymptomatic there was no pain it was functioning normal it was fine 
and these x-rays showed what clearly is an unusual metallic object they know the x-ray machines 
were working fine because other x-rays taken that day did not show anything like this so this caused 
a lot of concern among the dentists and they wanted to know what this object could possibly be 
and nancy joked well it must be an alien implant she was just joking but the dentists were very 
serious about this and puzzled and she requested copies of the x-rays which they gave to her 
and she went home and began to do research and the first thing she did was call the dentist 
who had taken x-rays three years earlier it was a different dentist in the same clinic 
and she went and met with him and looked at the x-rays and sure enough there was the same sort of 
round foreign body in anthony's mouth so this had been there for three years 
so she started doing more research on the internet trying to find out what this could possibly be 
and there was no information out there and everything she looked into kept coming back to the 
possibility that this might be an alien implant and that's when she contacted me and asked me to 
help her and figure out what this thing could be that was in her son's mouth she sent me the x-rays 
and my first course of action was to of course interview both of them to see if there was any 
history of ufos and as far as nancy knew no there wasn't they had no history of ufos 
but as she questioned anthony he did admit that he was dreaming about human-looking nordic ET's 
and further questioning revealed that he had in fact had a ufo sighting this was 
quite shocking to her she wasn't aware of this and uh anthony admitted that it was 
somewhere somewhere around age 14 before this first x-ray was taken that he was walking outside 
their home in indiana with his friend and they saw a ufo blue and yellow lights hovering overhead 
which suddenly dropped down it started flashing colored lights at them as anthony says 
it dropped a little and it went down it's what it did afterwards this is how I know it was a ufo 
because all of a sudden the colors started going crazy then it went back up and boom it was gone 
this was apparently a close encounter anthony is not sure if he had missing time or not there's 
no clear indication of it but this is definitely a connection probably to this apparent alien implant 
because this is when it first appeared and further questioning revealed that not only was anthony 
having ufo dreams nancy had as well and she said that when anthony was only three years old 
she had a very unusual dream that she saw her son anthony submerged in this small pool of this weird 
clear gelatinous liquid that he was apparently breathing and his eyes looked very different they looked much larger than normal they were huge much 
like ETs portrayed in the popular media and in this dream he had very thin wispy white hair 
so this was another possible clue that something very strange was going on 
so the next year they went to the dentist again on december 12 2016. and 
this time they were taking x-rays again to see if this implant was still there and their insurance 
covered only two x-rays but something very unusual happened they took the first x-ray and the dentist 
knew about this anomaly in anthony's mouth and sure enough the first x-ray showed it they took 
another x-ray less than one minute later about 30 seconds later and the implant was gone it was not 
there in the x-ray and this was quite baffling and they took a third x-ray which they did not charge 
nancy for because they wanted to find out if this implant was in fact gone but the third x-ray 
showed that this implant was back in place this was very puzzling to the dentists and 
in fact one of the dental technicians was so upset she had to leave the office 
and this was very very puzzling to everybody and as nancy says and I quote 
there's no explanation for it the coming and going of this object where it's at it being circular and 
perfect and this really started to cause her all kinds of concern 
and she wasn't sure whether to leave this alone or to pursue it and as she says I was thinking 
of just totally leaving this thing alone just letting it go and moving on it is what it is 
but there was another part of me that wanted to know at this point uh having interviewed both 
anthony and nancy my next step was to send these x-rays to medical professionals I knew a emergency 
physician who was also a UFO researcher in fact he's quite prominent in the field he wants to 
remain anonymous but he did view the x-rays and comment on them and his first question again 
was did anthony shoot himself in the mouth with the bb gun which of course he did not 
and this doctor did leave a written comment and as he says and I quote there is nothing 
natural about a perfectly spherical metallic density foreign body as shown in the x-rays 
and I showed it to another medical professional a general doctor and he had the same comment 
he said this is clearly artificial this is metallic whatever it is he's also a UFO researcher 
and uh asked again if anthony had shot himself in the mouth with the bb gun and 
again I said no nancy completely denies this as she says being around any type of bb gun it 
just didn't happen it's as simple as that and I pointed out to the doctor that listen there's no 
entry wound the tooth is asymptomatic and in fact this object looks quite a bit larger than a bb so 
they didn't know what to make of it other than that this was a foreign body nancy became more 
and more obsessed at this point and she really wanted answers as she says and I quote I always 
believe there is someone out there I never really thought about it after this happened I can't get 
it out of my head it's the most embarrassing thing about it it's like I have to get to the end of it 
it's stuck in my head there's not a day that goes by I don't think about it it's like I have to know 
is that insanity nancy felt like richard dreyfuss in close encounters this is how obsessed she was 
she wanted answers and there was no way to get to them it was clear to her that this 
was not normal but she just wanted to know for sure if this was in fact an alien implant 
and further questioning revealed that she herself did have something unusual I asked her 
you know did you have any nosebleeds do you have anything medical unusual about you because uh 
this is something that we see if a person's child is having experiences it's likely the parent is 
or someone in their family is and uh this jogged her memory and it turned out that around age nine 
or ten she had a strange object appear on the inner nasal passage an inch or two in a strange 
lump as she called it there's about an inch or two up inside of her nasal passage and as nancy says 
i can't explain it it's white and bony it's this thing up my nose I've had it my whole life I never 
gave it a second thought because it's always been there it's never caused me any harm this is where 
the case stood for a little while and anthony and nancy just tried to live a normal life but 
nancy could not let this go she wanted answers she was absolutely obsessed about it 
and it wasn't long before she got an answer and it was on may 5th 2017 when something very 
unusual had happened they went to bed as normal and sometime in the night anthony came into her 
room he was having trouble sleeping and this is of course something a lot of contactees report 
both anthony and nancy like to have a little bit of light on when they sleep a night light 
or perhaps the hall light on on this occasion they left the hall light on and the door cracked open 
and sometime in the middle of the night nancy woke up feeling like there was somebody in the room 
and took her a while to wake up she was having trouble waking up and opening her eyes 
and she realized that she couldn't move and she struggled and struggled to open her eyes and finally she did and as nancy says I was trying so hard 
i could see the hallway light shining into my room I couldn't move I couldn't move but 
i didn't want to move either I felt something a weird tingling sensation in my head in my brain 
it didn't hurt but it was like it was occupied it was really weird I was lying there trying my 
hardest to open my eyes to see what was next to me I looked over to my left and there were lights 
different colored lights in my room they were blinking purple yellow blue purple yellow blue 
so I looked over to see and it was happening again and I was like oh my god 
so she closed her eyes and opened them a couple of times and each time these lights were still there and she was starting to really freak out and turning over to look at her son 
she was amazed to see these short figures silhouettes mostly sort of hovering over 
her son and doing something and as nancy says some things were doing something to anthony 
i don't know what but I saw it I didn't understand it you would think that I would be scared somebody 
some beings some things whatever or whoever were doing something to my son I wasn't freaked out 
i wasn't mad or angry I can't even explain the feeling I wasn't feeling violated all I heard was 
it's okay that's all I kept hearing was it's okay it's okay they weren't here to hurt us and somehow 
i knew that the beings just kept saying over and over again in her head it's okay 
it's okay it's all right everything's going to be okay see it's okay it's okay at this point 
nancy looked over at the doorway to her bedroom and saw a typical gray standing right by the door 
and as she says and I quote this thing whatever I saw it wasn't tall I would guess about four feet 
it had a big head a skinny body and then I closed my eyes because I thought I don't want to see that 
it was just real quick and she looked back over at her son and as she says 
i could see these two alien looking figures I saw two of them doing things 
and she could feel them talking inside her head she says my brain had this feeling it 
didn't hurt but it kind of hurt and they just kept saying to her it's okay it's okay and she 
estimates they told her that about 50 times at which point she finally fell asleep and she woke 
up the next morning and instantly remembered the events of the previous evening she froze 
there and her son looked at her and said are you okay she said yes actually I'm really good 
i'm fine and he said are you sure because it was clear to him that something was going on and 
she said that yes I'm actually really good she says she felt an incredible weight coming off of 
her shoulders she felt a real sense of relief like she had finally gotten some answers as to what was 
going on with her son and she told them don't be afraid don't get scared but I think they came 
they came to me and anthony said what do you mean and nancy explained that this could have been a 
dream she didn't think so but these grays came and anthony said they were doing stuff to you 
she said no no they were doing stuff to you and I was just lying there and anthony said oh I wonder 
if my alien implant is still there and nancy replied I don't know it turned out they were 
due to go back to the dentist in a couple of months so they would soon find out but nancy 
still felt this incredible relief and she says all the things that I used to feel all the nervousness 
it's okay now I don't have to worry now that's all I know that's what I was told everything is okay 
i don't understand but the funny thing is after all this I've calmed down I'm still embarrassed and jittery about thinking of this implant but it's like they gave me a 
small taste of an answer and I'm good with that just enough to tell me it's okay it's all right 
you don't have to feel this way anymore that's what happened it was real I felt everything I saw 
those lights there's no doubt in my mind that what I saw was real I woke up refreshed in an odd way 
it's like I got an answer just enough of an answer to calm me down and that's it 
in july 2017 they went back to the dentist and sure enough the implant was still 
there x-rays showed that it was still in the exact same place at one point anthony did get 
his wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon offered to remove this implant but anthony denied it uh this request he said no I don't want it removed 
uh so this is when other interesting things started to happen nancy felt 
the urge to make some big changes in her life she was having some problems with uh being overweight 
and decided to start eating more healthy which she did and I should mention here that nancy 
does have a lot of lucid dreams and is very much sensitive and awake in her dreams quite a bit 
and her son anthony is also very psychic and has been from a very young age as a little boy he saw 
spirits and as he grew up he would constantly have precognition and clairvoyance in fact it 
was a daily event and I think this is significant because this is a pattern that certainly turns up 
in other cases and following this visitation nancy started to have some recall of other visitations 
throughout her life in fact she remembered that often when she would go to sleep she would say 
something like it's okay to come tonight and then she would be visited by these grays she said that 
uh this happened several times it was always the same thing she would say something like quote 
it's okay if you want to come tonight and it was just a thought that she would put out there and 
sure enough they would come she says that's when they chose to come these grays these 
beings whatever the heck they are it's been very very few a few major ones and a few small ones 
and then in mid november 2018 nancy was falling asleep and on impulse she put out the thought 
it's okay it's okay if you want to come tonight and she says the reaction was almost instantaneous 
as she says I just remember falling asleep and I'm gone I'm out of my room and I'm on 
this ship but it's not a ship I mean it is but it isn't nancy nancy was surprised to find herself 
in a room with sort of rounded walls there was a strange looking door oval shaped 
there were windows she could see blue sky outside of him there was a little couch a love 
seat a little chair a flat screen tv carpet and there was a young man sitting on this love seat 
she had the feeling that this was actually a craft but it had been sort of dressed up 
as a living room to make her feel more comfortable as she says I don't know but it was like they were 
trying to simulate a comfortable environment and she says the man was quite young she says he 
had to be about 20 he had brown hair a normal guy there was nothing wrong with him but interestingly 
she and this man began to communicate telepathically and she says to him so you're here 
too and this young man nods and she says why are you here and he shrugged he didn't know he says 
it'll be okay it'll be all right and nancy nodded the man stood got up and looked out the window 
and nancy had the feeling that it was very much like they were waiting inside a doctor's office 
and this is when this door swished open and boy did she get a shock when this figure walked in 
and it was a very tall praying mantis as nancy says and I quote I saw this shadow and then all 
of a sudden oh my god it was so tall huge it looked literally just like a praying mantis 
except he wasn't green he had this beetle-like armor like a shell really elongated fingers 
and really big eyes he wasn't green he was grayish brown with shades and mixtures 
nancy felt no fear she was absolutely calm and as she watched this praying mantis entered the room 
and walked straight over to the man as nancy says while this kid was looking out the mantis then 
came over and put something on the back of his neck and I saw exactly what it looked like it was 
like a big needle except it didn't have a point it had like a sound card one inch each way it was 
really flat and you could tell it had computer stuff on it and he put it on the back of his 
neck that's all he did it didn't hurt him he just kept looking out the window like it was nothing 
and then he turns to me and I hear these clicking noises he made these weird clicking sounds 
and as this being approached nancy was very much impressed by the way it moved with these jerky 
bug-like movements and she says you know how bugs do that especially that weird head 
movement it's really quick and twitchy and the spring mantis held up this little instrument 
uh clearly intending to use it on her and as nancy says I wasn't scared I stood up and this 
is exactly what I said I said no uh-uh no but it just kept coming and it kind of backed up 
a little was approaching me with that thing and then I don't remember anything and that was that 
nancy woke up and she was quite surprised the whole experience was very puzzling to 
her especially how the room was dressed up like a living room I mean it even had 
cheap carpet the sofa the chair windows the flat screen tv but she was absolutely convinced that 
this was in fact the interior of a UFO and she had been taken on board it was a fully 
conscious experience it wasn't like a normal dream at all she was awake and of course there was this 
huge praying mantis and that was really shocking to her she told her son anthony what had happened 
and began to describe this praying mantis anthony was on the computer at the time and nancy didn't know it but anthony immediately began searching for images of praying mantises and 
came upon some drawings done by other contactees and he called his mom over to the computer and 
showed her these images drawn by other contactees and nancy got a real shock because one of these 
pictures showed exactly what she saw as she says there was one picture on there it was like oh my 
god that's it that's it right there it was like right in front of me somebody had done a drawing 
and not only that as she read the description of what the contact he experienced it was exactly the 
same that she had described the same details this person also described how these praying mantis 
talk this with this weird clicking noise and also described how they move with very quick 
sharp jerky like movements so this was absolute confirmation to her that this experience was real 
and that's where their encounters at this point stand again they prefer to remain anonymous I did 
cover their story in my book wondrous 25 true UFO and cultures it's one of my favorite encounters 
in this book I've interviewed a lot of people who've had this experience but uh this mother-son duo really touched my heart I've come to look at them as really good friends and 
i'm just really affected by their experience and I think it's got some very interesting facets to it 
it can show again how people don't realize their contactees their whole life it's a very benevolent 
case they have no real fear I'm also struck by how psychic anthony is I expect he will be doing 
important work in his life and I also found it very interesting that nancy described being not 
only seeing grace but praying mantis as well and seeing the interior of the room dressed up like a 
living room because this is something I have heard from other contactees and have read about in other 
cases the ET's have a very advanced technology they are able to do this to reduce the fear factor 
of UFO witnesses it's an amazing case and I really want to thank nancy and anthony for sharing 
their story and allowing me to tell other people about it and 
it's just an amazing case and that's why I wanted to share with you all today I hope you found it 
interesting and I want to thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate it 
and until next time keep searching for answers and more importantly keep having fun.
