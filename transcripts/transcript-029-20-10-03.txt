THE ALIEN-CLOWN CONNECTION
Oct 3, 2020

Summary:
Oct 3, 2020
Alien clowns! It may sound bizarre, but it's true. People are being visited by aliens dressed up as clowns! Several researchers have reported cases like these. Extraterrestrials are not only dressing up as clowns, but in other strange outfits, such as cowboy costumes or old-fashioned tuxedos and pin-stripe suits. Sometimes they even come wearing wigs or toupees!

Are these screen memories? Are the aliens actually wearing these clothes? What is the purpose behind this strange behavior? If they are trying to reduce the fear factor, it's not working very well! Fear of clowns is so common, it has its own name: coulrophobia. Could the ETs responsible for this widespread fear of clowns?

This video presents true firsthand cases from people across the world who have encountered aliens dressed up as clowns or other characters. It also provides some insights into why this might be happening.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and today's episode is called the alien  
clown connection yeah i know that sounds weird  but i keep running across cases in which ets  
are apparently dressed up as clowns  uh this happens mostly with children  
but it's definitely consistent i'm certainly  not the only researcher who has run across  
cases like these there are many others  this may be related to the phenomena  
of screen memories or maybe even a little bit more  than that it could be that these ets are actually  
physically dressing up this way and not only as  clowns but as a number of other disguises as well  
so let's just take a look at some  of these cases bud hopkins certainly   has run across this phenomena as he says and  i'm quoting here i have encountered at least  
five abductees with the same dread fear of  clowns in every case dating from childhood  
most sight clowns scary exaggerated eyes and  mask-like painted faces it would seem that for  
some abductees seeing the natural human physical  body and or face stylized or distorted triggers  
memories of the aliens non-human appearance  and he actually quotes one of the cases that he  
found with this as he says this is the witness  actually talking i have my little idiosyncrasies  
as a matter of fact the only thing that used to  scare me as a child that i didn't like is clowns  
i think i didn't like anything staring at me  and i just don't like clown faces julia has  
clowns all over and i don't like them i just  never liked them so hopkins is saying here  
that it's the clown's appearance that  reminds abductees of their own et encounters  
but i actually think it goes deeper than that  because there are many cases in which et's have  
actually appeared as clowns in fact  raymond fowler has a case from a lady  
he calls gene and uh as fowler writes  raymond fowler we found that gene had gone  
through what seemed like a conditioning  process conducted by the alien entities   from time to time an entity would show itself  to her and then disappear however it seemed to  
be dressed in some sort of costume or mask jean  later would compare the outfit to that of a clown  
it dressed so ridiculously that had jean reported  it no one would have believed her jean believed  
the one who initially came was the same gray  e.t but disguised in a clown-like costume  
and wig and raymond fowler actually quotes gene  directly as jean herself says he has a big head  
but it's like like a monster or something  like something white on him or teeth or some  
long thing like funny hair or something  i don't know like a clown or something
so as we can see bud hopkins and raymond  fowler both have run across cases like these  
raymond fowler speculates uh that  the et dressed is a clown to sort of  
invalidate the abduct his experience make it  seem so ridiculous and outlandish that no one  
would ever believe her but i'm thinking  there might be actually another reason  
but these cases are very strange and they reach  very bizarre levels there's an english researcher  
peter huff who's investigated several abduction  cases and he's run into this phenomena as well  
he certainly talks quite a bit about uh how  people fear clowns in our society uh the fear  
of clowns is fairly widespread it's called cool  rhophobia and uh a lot of people have a deathly  
fear of clowns and he huff points out you know  how saturated our culture is with the idea of evil  
clowns everything from the joker in the batman  series uh john wayne gacy of course the convicted  
murderer dressed up as pogo the clown there is  of course the film and novel by stephen king  
it the killer clown and definitely movies  about clowns even clowns from outer space  
so this is a motif a theme that runs through  our culture and may in fact have its origins in  
this bizarre phenomena where ets dress up  as clowns and show themselves to little kids  
huff cites one case from the 1960s this is in  england where two children stephanie and janice  
who apparently may have been having encounters  were outside their home playing with other  
children and there was this row of abandoned  houses and buildings that the children would often  
play in and stephanie and janice were exploring  one of these homes when they saw something  
very very strange and it was this floating sort of  uh clown costume and i'll just uh quote peter huff  
here directly the room was black with mildew and  yet in the midst of all the decay the costume hung  
like a sparkling jewel a tomato red satin costume  with white spots and philly cuffs ankle and collar  
suspended by a loop was a clown's hat with a white  pom-pom sewn on the top the girls stepped over the  
threshold into the room so they're staring at this  perfectly clean spotless clown costume in a place  
where it absolutely cannot be these are abandoned  buildings and yet here's this brand new looking  
clown costume so one of the girls steps up and she  decides she's gonna try try and touch these things  
stephanie is the one who tries to touch it and as  stephanie says and i'm quoting all the while i was  
conscious of janus standing behind me i stretched  out my hand and as i did so the costume shimmered  
so this freaked them out and they ran off because  this costume was not physical it appeared to  
be some sort of hologram or something this is  certainly what peter huff speculates and honestly  
we don't know because the witnesses left uh what  is interesting about this case is following this  
incident one of the witnesses became obsessed with  clowns and began collecting those little ceramic  
clown dolls that are really popular they're  called perro dolls and they have this sort of  
white ceramic face with large dark eyes which does  look a lot like you know how people describe et's  
so he speculates perhaps that in this case the ets  were using the clown suit as bait to lure children  
and he has another case that speaks towards this  this other case again is from peter huff in this  
case the witness her name is abigail she's a  little girl and was having encounters as a very  
young child one evening she was staying at her  grandparents house when she woke up to see a very  
strange figure standing next to her bedside as she  says and i'm quoting her it's white with very very  
blue eyes its face is painted some sort of  clown with a big grin it's horrible i hate it  
and uh this is not the only time she's seen this  figure it came to her several times each time  
dressed up in this weird clown costume complete  with you know makeup and this sort of shimmery  
reflective material and as peter huff says he the  alien tried to entice abigail by telling her she  
would meet other children just as pennywise  the clown entity in stephen king's novel it  
used colorful balloons to entice his young victims  down the storm drain so there are many cases  
like this here's an anonymous case from a  lady who posted her experience on the web  
hoping to get other witnesses and uh she  had this experience when she was very young  
and i'll just quote her directly as the  anonymous witness says when i was very  
young i was supposed to be in bed while my  parents hosted a holiday party i don't recall   having any particular fear of things in the  night darkness being alone until that night  
the way my bedroom was situated you could look  directly through my door and through the window in   a bedroom across the hallway something woke me up  and i saw an eerie white head or face staring at  
me through the window i remember being terrified  and thinking i heard some kind of scratching noise  
so she ran away and ran  down into the party her mom   uh let her stay up and uh ever since then she's  had this sort of dread fear of this window and  
can't even look out this particular window because  she's afraid she's going to see some kind of face  
and she's now 39 years old at least when she  posted this account and the reason she posted  
it is this as she says and again i'm quoting  i have taken great pains to keep my son now  
13 away from all the ufo hype it has terrified me  most of my life and i didn't want that for him so  
he has not been fed anything my husband believes  it borders on evil so things of this nature are  
never discussed in my home when my son was about  two he would tell me about clowns in the window  
the first time i heard it it gave me chills he  would tell me in detail about them and still  
remembers thinking he saw them even trying to  get in we are very strict about tv in our house  
we don't watch horror stuff i didn't even allow my  son to watch power rangers until past the age when  
most kids were watching so where did he come up  with this is her question and what really shocked  
her is there was another account within her  family she had one of her stepsons who's now 25  
suddenly start joking around the dinner  table about how he as a kid would see this  
white face this white head staring at him in the  night and he could hear this weird scratching nose  
scratching noise so this really freaked the  witness out and she posted this on the web  
looking for other people who may have had similar  stories and i have to tell you there are similar  
stories out there here's a case which comes  from mufon this occurred to a little girl by the  
she's let's see 15 years old this is in goshen  new york occurred around july 1968 and she woke  
up one evening and she saw what she thought were  children out in the backyard little short figures  
and she was in bed looking through the window  and suddenly these figures came zooming towards  
her and the next thing she knows they're in her  bedroom they must have come through the wall   through the closed window or something the window  was not open so she's freaking out she's now  
unable to move and these figures are surrounding  her bed physically examining her and they have  
some kind of instrument which allows them to  see all of her body organs her interior vital  
organs in full living color this is something i've  heard many times before from other uh experiencers  
so this is what she's describing and the ets i  believe they were ets so does she at this point  
they tell her that there is something wrong  with one of her ovaries mind you she's only  
15 years old at this point so she's  not quite sure what to make of this and  
at some point the experience ends she wakes up  the next morning thinking could this have been  
a dream she goes outside and looks for evidence  can't find any sign of footprints or anything so  
she's really curious about it when suddenly her  young cousin who was also staying at her home  
comes running out this is at you  know breakfast time the next morning  
and uh they were all having you know coffee  and donuts and her cousin michael wakes up  
comes running into the kitchen and looks out the  window yelling did you see the clowns the circus  
and the witness was of course shocked and  wanted to ask him right away what the heck  
he was talking about but she didn't want to  bring up her own experience so she just waited a  
few minutes and went to him after breakfast  and asked him about what he said and michael  
who was just a little kid had no memory of what  he had said or anything about clowns or anything  
and there is a little strange end note to this  experience at age 39 the witness had a partial  
hysterectomy and the doctor told her that there  was a problem with one of her ovaries and that it  
didn't look good so she connects that definitely  to that early childhood experience at age 15.  
but what's curious here is how her cousin michael  believed he saw clowns so what is going on here i  
certainly have run across this phenomena in my  own research there was one lady i interviewed  
who's i call marcelina that's not her real  name she lived in topanga canyon where she  
had a number of experiences particularly during  the topanga canyon ufo wave of 1992 to 1994  
but as a very young girl had an experience  where she saw a gray looking in in at her  
through the window except this grey was  apparently dressed up as a clown or somehow  
uh its appearance reminded her of a clown  as she says and i'll just quote her directly  
there was this thing standing at my parents  french doors its face was like a whitish face  
the way my mind made it look was into almost a  clown type face it had black eyes what i remember  
was there was a bush with orange flowers what  i did was i made it look like a clown because  
of the orange flowers near the head i know  i was awake and me making the flowers turn  
into something that looked like a wig it was  exactly like a cat face without hair with very  
big eyes so i always had a fear of clowns since  that time because it was like someone looking  
in my window and why is this person dressed like  a clown i was always afraid of clowns after that  
that's not the only case i've run into with this  weird phenomena an even more disturbing case and  
more vivid involves a lady by the name of  laura she's from cicero illinois where she's  
had a number of experiences she had a very  close-up sighting of a ufo as a little girl  
uh saw this object move right over her head  on a very crowded street which was strangely  
empty of traffic that's something we see a lot  so she's had a number of very vivid sightings  
and as an adult her young son also started having  sightings he complained how he had this monster  
visiting him in his bedroom he called it the  bony crab monster and it was really upsetting  
because it had a very scary appearance and  it came and it cut his finger on one occasion  
but important here is this experience that  laura had as a young child and she was initially  
hesitant to even tell me about it reluctant  because she wasn't sure if it was related to her  
ufo experiences but she felt that it might and she  brought it up because she was concerned about this  
and here's what she says and i'll just quote laura  directly as she says i was really really young  
i don't remember how old i was exactly but it was  about five i just remember it didn't feel like a  
dream at all and i wasn't sick so i wasn't having  one of those fever things i just remember feeling  
like there was this person next to me who looked  like the joker on a deck of cards i mean he was  
white a white face and had this really big toothy  smile i don't remember what his nose looked like  
his eyes were kind of squinty like on the joker  cards he had on a whole outfit it was velvety  
and it was purple and gold and he was bouncing  up and down and making this really weird noise  
and every time he bounced i would hear this  jingling a harlequin outfit usually has bells   on it but i noticed this one didn't have any bells  on it so i don't know why i was hearing this sound  
so this is a complicated case uh i wrote a whole  chapter about this in my book extraterrestrial  
visitations and uh this clown visitation didn't  stop there she next found herself in a strange  
place and uh i'll just again quote her directly  as to what next happened with this weird alien  
harlequin as laura says i looked down and i could  see i was naked i could see the tops of my knees  
and pubic area he disappeared around the front of  me and then i felt something i felt something cold  
and wet and i remember seeing somebody showing  me a knife like a scalpel and then a table draped  
in the same kind of fabric he was wearing i know  this is stupid i thought it was some kind of abuse  
thing but i had no idea what it could have been  i felt as if it was a hidden memory it was very  
clear i can see it all now i never lost the memory  uh so yeah i do obviously think this is related  
i think these ets are dressing up as clowns  in an attempt to reduce the fear factor to  
come something that they think children enjoy  seeing clowns at the circus i'm just speculating  
here that perhaps they studied our culture  and this is the reason they're doing that  
hard to say but there are some cases which speak  towards that i mean i could march out more clown  
cases but sometimes they dress up in other  costumes like cowboys this is what happened  
to anna jamerson anna jamerson is a horse farmer  and a horse trainer she lives in central virginia  
and she has had experiences her whole life she  actually has written a book about it with her  
friend anna jamerson who's also an experiencer  they both wrote both wrote this amazing book it's  
called connections and i highly recommend it it's  a very vivid account of their experiences with  
ufos and gray et's which were not particularly  pleasant at any rate the experience important here  
is very interesting what happened was anna  was driving near her home when suddenly her  
car died for no apparent reason and she's stranded  there on the side of the road wondering what she's  
gonna do when suddenly a figure appears and it's  walking towards her car and she looks up and  
gets a real shock because it looks like a  cowboy or at least this guy is wearing a  
giant stetson hat an oversized stetson cowboy hat  and he saunters up and asks if he can help and uh  
opens the hood and starts looking at the engine  with apparently a flashlight and uh she's looking  
at him and starts to get confused because he does  not look normal not only is this hat way oversized  
as if his head is the size of three basketballs  she said but he was wearing dark wrap around  
sunglasses at night which makes no sense at all  and not only that he had this weird fake mustache  
and just was sort of this stereotypical cowboy  look but was actually wearing this very tight  
fitting jumpsuit at some point she had missing  time he disappears the car starts and she goes  
home and it was later she realized you  know just how bizarre this experience was  
so uh as she says she thinks that he probably  this gr was a gray and he probably appeared  
this way because she as a horse person might be  less threatened by someone dressed up as a cowboy  
as she says my logical side my rational side  tells me something happened to me on that road  
and whoever or whatever it was thought a  real good disguise to relax a horse person  
would be to show up as a cowboy so i think that's  probably what is going on in cases like these  
but perhaps they're just  simple disguises to sort of   hide their presence and there's a couple  of cases that do speak to that as well  
there's one case which occurred in 1969  in the deserts of southern california  
this comes from a park ranger by the name of  wesley n horn who wrote an article called the  
alien in the cowboy hat and he had encountered  an old timer who was out there in the desert who  
told him this encounter so it's coming to  him second hand but nevertheless it's still  
a very interesting account and i'd just like to  quote wesley horn briefly here as wesley says  
the man told me that the individuals he had  encountered looked very much like we do the  
most striking difference he said was from  above their eyes to the tops of their head  
in exactly what ways i am not sure but i  believe he said that their heads were larger  
possibly indicating a larger brain for that reason  they told him they always wore cowboy hats when  
they visited earth so alien cowboys yeah cowboys  and aliens perhaps not far off from the truth  
and there are other cases where et's seem  to come dressed up in ways that are tailored  
to the personality of the individual whitley  strieber cites a case from an abductee by the  
name of joe sharp who is a chinese woman and very  traditional and she had a very bizarre experience  
where et's came to her dressed up in wearing [ __  ] hats as she says they were quote three feet tall  
all of them wearing chinese [ __ ] hats so  perhaps this is an attempt to reduce the  
fear factor by appearing as something familiar and  there are other cases where et's dress up in weird  
costumes one case comes from  british researcher hillary evans  
he's a long time researcher in this subject and he  cites the case of glenda a young girl from england  
who was having visitations and this et  went to these ridiculous lengths i think to  
hide the fact that it had this very large  oversized bald head which seems to be the  
one detail that really freaks people out so what  this e.t did was wear a wig as hilary evans writes  
she realized she was not alone in the  room and with her was a strange female   who she would later describe as a space woman  and who in the drawing made of her looks like a  
character from a television science fiction series  yeah you can see glenda's drawing here and it  
clearly shows what we would describe as a you know  the typical gray except it's got this beautiful  
head of long luxurious hair tumbling down its  shoulders and interestingly is also wearing  
a very colorful loose shiny clothes very much like  a clown and there are other cases in which ets  
will suddenly uh come having hair on their head  which is clearly not real there's one case of  
a lady who was taken on board a craft and she  was pretty frightened and she's standing next  
to these greys when suddenly one of them  changes its appearance in this weird way  
and as she writes i was standing with two of them  and noticed that they had no hair they seemed to  
be smiling without moving their mouths as soon  as i thought hair one of them seemed to produce  
reddish gold hair all over its head  this frightened me so ironically
despite if the ets are trying to you know  reduce the fear factor it's just causing uh fear  
to sort of escalate with a lot of these witnesses  not surprisingly whitley strieber has reported  
similar incidents he had pretty  much an identical experience to this  
where he was taken on board a craft and i'll just  let him describe what he saw as strieber says in  
this room with me were four other beings visitor  who had come to get me was standing behind me  
sitting behind the desk was what looked to me  like a man with a very very long face round  
black eyes and a ridiculous excuse for a curly  black toupee on his head he was wearing a green  
plaid flannel shirt and leaning so far back in his  chair that i could see he had on baggy cocky pants  
and a wide belt he looked like something from  another world wearing the clothes of the 40s  
so this is very bizarre here we have another  e.t dressed up in colorful clothes and  
wearing a toupee very strange and this is not the  only time whitley strieber has seen something like  
this he had another experience on march 15 1986  where he found grays surrounding his bed he woke  
up he tried to move he could just barely move he  tried really hard to turn on the lamp but it was  
like moving through molasses he said he finally  reached the lamp and the light wouldn't work  
so he turns his attention back to these figures  and gets an incredible shock and again i will just  
quote him briefly here as whitley says when  i turned my head back i confronted a sight  
so weird i thought afterward that i  did not know how to write about it   i still don't so i am just going to plunge ahead  beside my bed and perhaps two feet from my face  
close enough to see it plainly without my glasses  was a version of the thin ones the type i have  
called her it was not quite right though its  eyes were like big black buttons round rather  
than slanted it appeared to be an inept cardboard  imitation of a blue double-breasted suit complete  
with a white triangle of handkerchief sticking  out of the pocket i was overcome at this point  
by a terror so fierce and physical that it  seemed more biological than psychological
so this really stunned him he couldn't imagine  the purpose of this and yeah again we as we see  
in other cases it just sort of escalated his  fear and uh as whitley says the thing before  
me seemed like a sort of interrogatory why the  suit did it mean that they were showing me a mail  
and he found out you know at the time he thought  this was unique but found out later that nope not  
unique other people have also reported seeing  et's appear to them dressed up in old style  
suits again i'll just quote with whitley briefly  here as whitley says i found that one of the  
other people i have met also had an experience  involving visitors in archaic suits this suggests  
that the visitors are not too interested in our  clothing or are confused about its significance  
or perhaps their thought processes have not  gotten very far yet in regard to clothing  
it may be that if we ever meet them openly they  will not be quite as naked as the creatures who  
emerged in close encounters perhaps they will be  wearing double-breasted suits circa 1952 complete  
with pocket handkerchiefs and i know how bizarre  this sounds but there are multiple cases here's  
one case from mufon uh this is occurred to a  gentleman from amsterdam new york and it occurred  
to him before he had ever heard about the whitley  strieber case and he was inspired to report it  
after seeing the movie communion which featured an  e.t dressed up in a suit and this is what happened  
to this witness and i'll again just quote him  directly this was in 1980 and as the witness says  
out of the corner of my left eye i saw movement  at the back door i looked and saw a six-foot  
grasshopper-ish being with a tuxedo with  tails a top hat and a black cane with a carved  
bone-like top he knocked on the back screen  door i looked back at my coffee cup in disbelief  
then i looked again and it was still there cocking  his head i looked away again in fear i looked one  
final time saw it was still there and that's the  last i remember the whole event took only moments  
so as bizarre as that experience sounds i find it  very credible just because there are so many other  
cases with this same bizarre detail there's  another case from mufan in which a gentleman  
woke up and uh from a nightmare he often  suffered from nightmares and woke up to see  
this gray standing at the foot of his bed  and again it was dressed up in one of these  
pin stripe suits very very strange and i  certainly have run into a case like this myself  
one of the witnesses who i encountered who  had this experience i wrote about her case  
in my latest book or my a recent book on  board ufo encounters the witness's name is  
pat and she's had experiences her whole life  in fact as a very young girl around age five  
she got had went to the circus one day came back  and was staying at her grandparents house and on  
the second story in a bedroom and woke up and  saw something staring at her through the window  
it was this weird sort of pale face with dark eyes  and her initial thought was that something had  
followed them home from the circus and was peering  into her window so again we have this weird clown  
motif again but it was many years later she had  had you know a number of missing time incidents  
a number of ufo sightings she's now an adult and  she's coming home late one evening walks into her  
living room and sees two or three grays or not  your stereotypical greys had tan skin actually  
standing in her living room and one of them  was wearing something very strange and uh she  
had never heard of anything like this so i'll  just quote her directly this is pat talking  
as pat says they could not pass for human one was  light colored and the other was a lighter gray  
or tan and if i tell you what it was dressed in  you're going to think i'm crazy it was dressed in  
a roaring 20s kind of zoot suit it was trying not  to scare me i looked at it at the outfit i knew  
it was projecting what it was wearing because  it was trying not to scare me so in her case  
it did seem to work to reduce the fear factor  but in most cases no i don't think it works  
i did a study of these types of cases in my book  not from here volume one uh and uh yeah wrote  
about this weird alien clown connection there's no  denying it takes place there's far too many clay  
cases uh you know i wrote this article and uh i  still don't quite understand what's going on here  
could this be a screen memory you know where  as et's appearing perhaps as uh owls or deer  
i've run into a number of cases with all kinds  of screen memories one lady she would describe  
three foot tall teddy bears other people have told  me you've been being dressed up as barbie or as  
superheroes or all kinds of screen  memories of vampires and monsters and  
what have you but i'm wondering if in these  cases they are actually wearing enough wigs  
actually putting on cowboy hats or clown  costumes complete with makeup uh it's hard to say  
and uh we really don't know exactly why they're  doing this it could be to test our emotional  
reactions it could be to disguise their identity  but ultimately i do think that they're coming  
dressed in this way in an attempt to reduce the  fear factor and i say this because of the cases  
in which they come dressed up pertaining  to that particular person's personality  
as with uh anna jamerson in the cowboy  incident or joe sharp and the chinese coolies
so i'm thinking they think that children love  clowns i know let's come up dressed as a clown  
and perhaps the kids won't fear us so if that's  their intention it has not worked very well  
because ultimately what it does is it just  scares the kids even more and i find it very  
interesting that there is now a very  widespread fear of clowns in our society  
that's called coulrophobia and a lot of people  have it in fact i once went to a ufo support group  
and uh knowing about this these types of cases  i brought it up i i said does anyone here have  
a fear of clowns it's like setting off an atom  bomb all of them started screaming and jumping  
up and going oh my god yes yes yes and it was  pretty much universal none of them liked clowns  
at all and uh i see this in people sometimes i  i've seen people who have such a fear of clowns  
that they will pass out if they see a clown or  just start screaming and running away in terror  
so this is now one of the questions i ask people  who i suspect of having encounters how do you feel  
about clowns do you have cool roof phobia because  it's very prominent within the abductee factor so  
yeah this is what i definitely think is happening  here i think they are dressing up as clowns to  
reduce the fear factor and ultimately it hasn't  worked so this definitely is related to the screen  
memory phenomena i think except for the fact that  they might be physically dressing up this way so  
as whitley strieber says don't be surprised if  you know an e.t comes dressed up wearing a toupee  
or a suit or something really bizarre because as  you can see these cases happen pretty consistently  
so for that reason i think it's important that  people know and that's why i put together this   video and that's it that's it for now thanks  once again for listening and keep having fun
