THE MALIBU ANOMALY: IS THIS AN UNDERSEA UFO BASE?
Oct 22, 2021

Summary:
Oct 22, 2021
Deep underwater, a few miles off the coast of Malibu, California, lies a massive and mysterious 
stone structure. With a large flat top and what appears to be giant columns and an entrance into 
a dark tunnel, the "Malibu Anomaly" has become famous across the world. Some say that it's a 
natural geological formation, while others believe it's an undersea UFO base. Which is the truth?

Natural or artificial, the structure is located in the center of a well-known UFO hotspot known 
as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro Channel. More than 150 documented cases of UFOs and "USOs" 
(unidentified submersible objects,) surround the area. Reports reach back more than 100 years 
and are still continuing to the present day. 

How old is this formation? If it is a construction, then who built it and why? Is the government 
aware of it? Could it actually be an undersea UFO base? Is it evidence of ancient aliens? Its 
unusual appearance, and the fact that there are so many UFO and USO reports lend credence to 
this theory. However, skeptics point out that there is no hard evidence proving that this 
structure is, in fact, made by extraterrestrials.

In this video, we take a deep dive into all the known evidence, and objectively examine everything 
that has been learned about this extraordinary structure known as the Malibu Anomaly. We will look 
at the distribution of the UFO and USO accounts in this area. We will hear of reports from UFO 
experiencers who may have actually been taken inside the base. We will hear theories and 
conclusions from scientists and ufologists who conducted firsthand investigations, including 
sending down an unmanned submersible to take a close-up look at the structure. We will examine 
this structure from every angle and see if we can come up with answers to the many mysteries 
surrounding the Malibu Anomaly.

surrounding it, and more, you may want to check out my book, "Undersea UFO Base: An In-Depth

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today's episode is called the malibu anomaly is this an undersea ufo base the malibu anomaly is an 
unusual and almost artificial looking structure located off the coast of malibu in southern 
california it has received a lot of attention in the media and on the internet as a possible 
undersea ufo base so that's what this episode is about today I want to take a deep dive into all 
the evidence surrounding this so-called malibu anomaly and see if we can figure out if it is an 
artificial structure and if this is evidence of an undersea ufo base or the base itself so I can tell 
you that I got involved in this field back in 1986 and almost immediately began to receive reports of 
ufos and usos unidentified submersible objects in this area and what I found was most all of 
the major southern california ufo researchers knew about this area and considered it a major hot spot 
pioneering southern california-based researcher ann druffle was probably the first to recognize 
this area as a hot spot and she's collected and investigated many encounters so has bill hamilton 
so has yvonne smith robert stanley barbara lamb many researchers in this area have collected 
accounts from this one particular stretch of water the stretch of water is known as 
the santa catalina san pedro channel it's a sharply defined area with a huge number 
of ufo and uso accounts and when I began to receive reports myself I started to collect 
them because it was clear to me that there was something very unusual going on in this area 
and that was my first real data point pointing towards the possibility of an undersea uso base 
it was the huge number of reports in this sharply defined area stretching back over a hundred years the second real data point was that some of these encounters involved not 
one or two objects but dozens many people have reported 10 20 30 even 40 objects coming up out 
of the water and in fact I have a couple of cases involving more than a hundred objects 
and that's when I really began to wonder could there be some sort of an undersea base 
in this area because if there wasn't there was certainly a parking lot filled with ufos and usos 
i also started to receive reports from abductees contactees who told me that they believed there 
might be a ufo base and in fact a couple of them said that they believed they were actually taken 
inside this space so that was another data point that i'll get into in just a bit 
i can say that all the locals in this area well most of them uh certainly know about the activity 
in this area it's very well known in fact it's so active that there is quite a few photograph 
photographs taken of ufos usos in this area not one or two but nearly a dozen cases of people 
who've been able to photograph ufos right in this same exact area so these were all these data 
points that uh I began to collect which really made me wonder if there was an undersea ufo base 
mind you this was well before the so-called malibu anomaly was discovered and back in 2006 I wrote 
an article for fate magazine titled is there an undersea ufo base off the california coast to my 
surprise and delight the editors at fate magazine put it on the cover the article itself 
went viral and was published all over the internet and even in newspapers and it led to a series of 
interviews I started speaking on this subject and the history channel called me up and asked me to 
be a part of their show deep sea ufos it was very successful so they called 
me back for deep sea ufos 2 and other television programs and this of course led to more reports 
coming in I eventually collected 150 some reports of ufos and usos and I plotted them all on a map 
and as I looked at these uh dots on the map showing the distribution of these ufos and usos 
became clear to me that they were clustered all in this one area the santa catalina channel but 
particularly off the coast of malibu and I thought to myself well you know if there is an undersea 
base in this area it's probably somewhere off the coast of malibu and again this is before 
the so-called malibu anomaly was discovered
the first person to that I could find to actually mention the possibility of an undersea base 
was not me it was robert stanley a southern california-based researcher he grew up in malibu 
he's the editor of the now defunct magazine unicus and he was the first to mention the possibility 
of an undersea ufo base in an article for his magazine unicus 
published in 1994 robert stanley wrote and I quote even in the 60s families were going down 
to the beach and waiting for a ufo to pass by many times I have wondered about the possibility of a 
facility being located underwater where the valley of moo now rests there have been many 
sightings by military and civilian sources of ufos entering and leaving the ocean in that area 
it's possible they also have something going on deep inside the mountains
so yeah he's absolutely the first to talk about the possibility of a base he had been 
very interested in unusual geological formations in the santa monica mountains and later he would 
be the first to discover the actual malibu anomaly itself but before that I was receiving reports of 
people who had been taken apparently inside an underground base in this area I talked to many 
abductees and contactees who had been taken on board ufos but a few of them said that they 
were taken into what appeared to be an underground area for me the most compelling case of this time 
this kind comes from a gentleman i'll call paul nelson that's a pseudonym 
i interviewed him because he had a very unusual experience on catalina island when he was 
just a young teenager today paul is a medical doctor a private pilot so he's a really good 
witness he does not want his name associated with this experience so he is anonymous 
but way back in 1967 when paul was 12 years old he and his family took a vacation on catalina island 
and paul and his best friend were on a boat in avalon harbor when they experienced a period of 
missing time as paul says it was just after dark far away from sleep time we sat down got our comic 
books open and then instantly we were unconscious the next thing we realized it was morning 
at the time paul and his friend didn't know what had happened they just could not believe 
they had fallen asleep because they were super excited to read their new comic books it made no sense to them interestingly it was just two weeks later paul had another 
unusual experience in his home in tarzana in which he saw the shadow of what appeared to be a gray 
type being on the wall of the hallway in his house but it wasn't until he was an adult 
that he found out about the ufo phenomena that he connected the dots and realized that 
this could be related to what he had experienced and he eventually went under hypnotic regression 
and under this hypnotic regression he was taken back to that 1967 incident on catalina island and 
he recalled being taken not into a ufo but into what appears to be an underground area and i'll 
just let paul describe what he recalls as he says I was taken into a round walled room it seemed to 
me more underground than it did onboard a ship the walls had kind of a rock-like facet to them 
and I was on a table there were some machines on the walls the beings weren't the typical greys 
they were more like the praying mantis type the eyes were slightly bigger than what is seen in the typical small gray and a little more insectoid-like they wore tight-fitting uniforms 
jumpsuit like things I think there was one in that bunch that had a tunic type thing 
more looser fitting over it paul recalled that he was just told to sit on a bench and wait while 
his friend was taken into another chamber and apparently examined paul felt no fear he wasn't 
the target of interest it was his friend but for him it was just a very interesting experience 
and I found it fascinating because it doesn't sound like he was inside a ufo 
and there are a few other cases where people report this sort of thing another case comes 
from well-known abductee kim carlsberg kim carlsberg is a professional photographer 
she worked on the television series baywatch and back in 1988 started to have ufo sightings 
and on-board ufo encounters some of which she remembered some of which were shrouded in 
missing time this was quite frightening for her these involved examinations 
by gray type extraterrestrials it was not a pleasant experience for her but she did have one 
experience in 1992 where she was taken to a vast auditorium area which she didn't say specifically 
was underground but certainly could have been just given the size of this room and as 
sh ken says I woke up in a lobby where many human beings were milling around they reminded 
me of patients waiting to endure their turn in a dentist's chair she said it looked very much 
like an auditorium and she was told by the ETs that they were all being prepared for something 
so that's another case a third case comes from ufo researcher debbie zieglemeyer
who has been studying uso accounts for several years she interviewed a southern california-based 
abductee by the name of linda porter who claimed to be taken to an underground base when she 
was just a teenager and I will just quote linda porter in her own words and that her to describe 
what she experienced as linda porter says I was supposedly taken to an underground base 
off the coast of california for some reason I was led to believe it was in the santa barbara area 
if you were standing on sand at the bottom of the ocean where this place was at all you could 
see is what looks like a silver submarine conning tower coming up out of the sand 
would probably be the height of a two or three story building I was told this tower thing was 
camouflaged by an electronic net of some kind that renders it invisible and they also have 
something around it that seems to repel people and fish inside the building the floors and the 
walls in the ceiling were all of the silver gray color there was a lot of light linda also reports 
that she saw many doorways and on top of each dory there was strange writing which looked like 
arabic or maybe egyptian hieroglyphics so there's a third case so these were the data 
points that really had me wondering could there be an undersea base off the southern california coast 
robert stanley had been particularly interested in unusual geological formations in the santa monica 
mountains and wondered if these were perhaps evidence of an ancient civilization known as mu 
and he first started looking at all the structures above the water on in the santa monica mountains 
itself but eventually extended his research into unusual structures beneath the ocean's 
surface and using google maps he made a very interesting discovery back in 2009
he saw what we now know to be the malibu anomaly and uh back then there were no 
applications to look sort of at a different angle so you could only look at it from above 
but what he saw was this extremely large flat area right off the coast of malibu 
and as he writes this mound looks man-made and is perfectly flat on top it is very large and 
is located due west of the ruins on boney ridge to me this mound-shaped object appeared to be an 
artificial ancient platform that is now under the water in 2010 I decided to pin the strange 
underwater mount in malibu on google earth for future reference however at that time I didn't 
think it was connected to the well-documented ufo and uso activity in the area which I had 
experienced many times near point magu by myself and with friends in 2000 in 2010 I also noticed 
what appeared to be columns at the base of the mound but I could not see the area in any detail
robert stanley knew about my research I had contributed to unicus magazine and 
was collecting these underwater reports for my book first ufo's over california 
and he actually emailed me and told me about this strange anomaly off the southern california coast 
i thought to myself well that's interesting because it did look artificial and if you look 
around this area there's nothing quite like it uh at the time I didn't know really what to think 
of it but it was not long after this that this anomaly began to really get a lot more attention 
on january 21st 2013 I received an email from a gentleman who identified himself as maxwell 
and he sent me a google link showing this massive structure and he wrote in his email to me 
here's something right off the southern california coast south of point magu it's three miles offshore zoom in on it and notice the entry areas there are many underwater 
structures including huge machines scraping the ocean floor so this was intriguing to me because 
not only did the structure have a very smooth flat top but you could see what appeared to be columns 
and what looked like a tunnel by this point I had received reports that there were tunnels 
crisscrossing the united states and one leading from area 51 in nevada to edwards air force base 
in the high deserts of southern california all the way to the santa catalina channel 
i thought wow perhaps this is the tunnel that i've been informed about or perhaps this is the 
actual undersea ufo base itself because it was located almost exactly where I had predicted 
there might be an undersea base so I was very much intrigued but this whole story caught fire in 2014 
when radio host jimmy church was also contacted by maxwell and together they started to 
look more deeply into this structure and using google applications 
they looked at this base from various angles and obtained images of what definitely appears to be 
huge columns or pillars and a deep dark tunnel leading into the uh coastline there 
and he published these images along with a little blog post and it went viral 
and he called me up and because he knew about my research into this area as well 
and had me on his radio show on may 25th 2014 I appeared on episode 67 of fade to black 
and discussed this malibu anomaly with jimmy church and we started talking about the name 
maxwell it rang a bell and I looked back in my emails and I saw sure enough this was the same guy who had contacted me a few years earlier but credit does have to be given to jimmy church 
for really publicizing this malibu anomaly and making it famous
absolutely robert stanley was the one who I think first discovered it as near as I can tell but jimmy church was the one who made it famous because on may 15 2014
author mark d kovar released a press statement which said in part and I quote 
a massive underwater entrance has been discovered off of the malibu california 
coast at point doom which appears to be the holy grail of uso ufo researchers 
that have been looking for it over the last 40 years the plateau structure is 1.35 miles by 2.45 
miles wide and six miles from land and the entrance between the support pillars is 2745
feet wide and 630 feet tall it also has what looks like a 
total nuclear bomb proof ceiling that is 500 feet thick the discovery was made by maxwell dale 
romero and jimmy church hos host of fade to black on the dark matter radio network on monday may 12 
2014 and announced on facebook twitter and church's radio program the following day 
the underwater base has been a mystery for many years with hundreds of ufo uso sightings 
many with photographs but the entrance of the base has remained elusive until now
so the coordinates of the base are 34 degrees 123.31 north 118 degrees 59 45.64 west 
which is very close to the center of the activity and in jimmy church's youtube post 
about the anomaly he writes the structure itself doesn't fit in with its natural surroundings 
this discovery was made by maxwell dale romero and myself two weeks ago this has been the center 
the hub of uso ufo activity going back 40 years thousands of witnesses going up and down the coast 
the residents here just pull up lawn chairs and watch the lights come in and out of the water 
all day long it's what they do now is this proof of an entrance to something inland we don't know 
it could be natural it could be ten thousand years old it could be a hundred years old we don't know 
why hasn't it been investigated or revealed until now we don't know so this was in fact discovered 
by robert stanley but jimmy church was the one who made it super famous and in fact after publicizing 
this his uh youtube post eventually garnered well over 370 000 views and this malibu anomaly became 
world famous and was the talk of the ufo community for quite some time and 
still is and a lot of people started to come forth with information about what they knew
one contactee wrote that it was a rogue pleiadian base and other whistleblowers started to come out 
saying that this was something the military was well aware of and that there were in 
fact underground bases in this area so the question is is this actually a natural formation 
or not and of course there are people on both sides of the fence um some are debunkers 
saying no this is not real or skeptics who do not believe it and others are absolutely 
convinced i'm a bit on the fence about it I want to remain objective because honestly I don't know 
but just looking at the structure it does look unusual but is this natural or is it not and 
how much can we trust these google images so a lot of people really started to question these 
images and one of the one researcher who looked into it quite deeply is researcher lee spiegel 
he interviewed a lot of the people involved and wrote an article for the huffington post 
which was somewhat skeptical in tone but did leave the possibility open that this was in 
fact a legitimate undersea base the article begins and I quote a little more than six miles 
off the coast of point doom malibu california an unusual looking structure sits on the seabed floor 
based on images obtained on google earth the oval shaped object has a huge flat 
top and what appears to be pillars or columns that seem to reveal the entrance to a dark 
inner place the anomaly for the moment we'll call it that is approximately two 
thousand feet below the surface of the water measuring nearly three miles wide 
what exactly is this thing lee spiegel interviewed jimmy church and jimmy church is quoted as saying 
my first impression was that it was greek it looked artificial and didn't look natural 
it just stands out that it has to be some kind of roof it's not unlike a domed stadium or a covered 
indoor race track or an olympic arena it's got that feel to it but spiegel went and got 
interviews from skeptics who are convinced that it is absolutely a natural formation he contacted 
earthquake geologist david schwartz of the u.s geological survey who was skeptical that this was 
an artificial construct and as david schwartz says and I quote I think it's natural and it's part of 
the continental shelf it's just a complicated part of what's now offshore that has seen some 
erosion and may be slumping when perhaps this was partially exposed when the sea level was lower 
this is a really major earthquake area and perhaps some of these features are a result of slope 
failures due to shaking there's no flag under the water that says i'm the entrance to an alien base 
there's nothing unnatural looking about it it's just showing some sort of variation 
in the offshore coastal morphology so this malibu anomaly is actually 
known as sycamore null which is in fact a thrust fault and according to 
david schwartz of the us geological survey this is in fact a natural formation 
lee spiegel also interviewed john anthony west who is an egyptologist who has studied ancient 
formations uh he does he's not a ufo researcher by any means but is familiar with large stone 
structures and according to egyptologist john anthony west and I quote my first reaction 
knowing that it was 2 000 feet under the water was that under no circumstances could it in fact 
be artificial man-made it doesn't look at all man-made it has what looks like pillars there 
but they're unevenly spaced and then to the right you see other seaming pillars 
that are still attached actually to the bedrock in the process of forming 
so west is believed that this is a natural geological formation 
finally lee spiegel contacted fbi agent former fbi agent if there is such a thing ben hansen 
and ben hansen provided google images of the base from different angles 
which showed this structure with no tunnel and what appears to be solid walls 
and he was also skeptical that this was anything artificial now here's the crux 
of the problem we have different images some of which clearly show a tunnel and some which don't 
so how do you choose between them which ones are accurate it's very hard to say you can't very well 
choose one over the other and still be objective about this we have to examine all the evidence 
but according to hansen these google images are not necessarily reliable as he says the dark 
areas that people are saying look like the inside of the base really start to look just 
like shadings of indentations to the shelf and the pillars are now represented as jagged ridges 
we're dealing with limited information to render the graphic because we can see it evidenced in the 
disparity of image quality between the anomaly and the areas immediately surrounding it the blurry 
sections and jagged edges obviously suggest a patchwork of image processing has taken place
so I don't know if I trust a former fbi agent or not when we know the fbi is actively engaged in 
a ufo cover-up so I certainly wouldn't expect them to say that this is a real honest-to-god 
alien base uh but lee spiegel did some good research into this area and closing off 
his article he left open the possibility that this was in fact genuine as he says 
in the end we're left with a variety of theories to explain the malibu anomaly aka sycamore null 
will the ufo alien underwater based proponents be eventually proven right leaving geologists in 
the deep blue dust scratching their heads and wondering how they got it all wrong
so lee spiegel was actually going to appear on jimmy church's show fade to 
black but following the appearance of this article in which came off as somewhat skeptical 
he was not on the show his appearance was canceled for some reason and this led to a 
little bit of a dust up that possibly there was a disagreement between jamie church and lee spiegel 
both of whom deny this but there was an article written by jim paris 
titled two ufo guys cross lightsabers over underwater alien base
and uh lee spiegel in response to this article writes sorry to disappoint but there is no bitter 
feud shaping up here on the day that my piece was published I sent it to jimmy and fully expected 
him to confirm my appearance on his show instead he emailed to let me know that he'd be discussing 
my story later that night but when he didn't mention that he wanted me to join him I knew that 
something wasn't quite right later that evening I tuned into the show to discover jimmy talking 
about how one-sided my article was and that my story placed too much emphasis on the idea 
that the underwater object may simply have been a natural geological formation 
lee spiegel defends his viewpoint and writes what I found in my research 
into the existence of the alleged malibu ufo base was that there is no definitive evidence of that 
it's more speculation and conjecture i.e the fact that there have been sightings of ufos 
usos in this area or that this underwater object seems to be situated in a geographic region that's 
allegedly within the coordinates of military installations speculation is not evidence my 
job despite what I may personally believe is to gather information from different sources 
and put that informat information into cohesive articles that offer different points of view to 
help readers decide for themselves which way the evidence leads them that's exactly how I 
wrote my malibu underwater object story and I won't apologize to anyone out there who may be 
unhappy that I didn't more fully support the idea that we're dealing with a ufo alien base 
out there in the water I went where the evidence took me and I offered it up if we all adhere 
to the mantra of go where the evidence leads you this whole ufo alien issue will be much better off 
and I agree yes let's follow the evidence and that's why I find these google images so intriguing and why I find it interesting that some choose to look at the 
images where it doesn't show this tunnel and others choose to look at the images where they do 
and I will say most of these images do show this tunnel and if you look at this malibu anomaly it 
does look a little strange is it artificial I mean it's hard to say for sure but I find it 
fascinating that it's right in the middle where there are so so many of these ufo uso reports
so let's go back to researcher robert stanley because when this whole 
controversy hit the internet and he saw that uh the so-called malibu anomaly that he discovered 
was going viral he had a few words to say about it for sure
and as he says in an article that he published in 2015 
titled who discovered the so-called malibu ufo base robert stanley writes I am certain that 
the u.s navy has known about the underwater structure entrance for quite a few decades 
but has not reported it publicly however I was the first civilian to discover the strange site 
while using 2009 google maps that's when I found what appears to be an ancient artificial 
underwater platform off the coast of malibu which made headlines around the world in 2014.
he wrote that he believes it may very well be extraterrestrial in origin as he writes it was 
constructed by in four amphibious alien gods and he speculates that this might be connected 
to all the strange ruins or alleged strange ruins that he found in the mountains of malibu 
but in a later article published in 2016 robert stanley uh wrote a more skeptical 
viewpoint of the possibility of this being an active alien base and that he also finds some of 
the google images suspect as he says unfortunately the digital images posted on the internet of what 
appear to be giant pillars holding up a massive roof to an entrance into the earth 
are actually erosion marks on a large cliff the data on google earth is generated by vertical 
scans which create distortions in vertical objects when tilt is applied to the map
uh but he still admits that this formation does look strange he says the top of this formation is 
incredibly flat and it has some interesting features that do not appear on google earth 
but he's absolutely not convinced that this is necessarily an alien base or is he he's 
kind apparently flip-flopped a little bit on this but as he writes unfortunately these illusionary 
images and unsubstantiated claims continue to captivate the imagination of millions of people 
around the world hopefully my new article will set the record straight and finally he closed it off 
by saying if there is a doorway to an underwater base in that area there is no way the navy wants 
the public or other military powers to see it however they may want to distract everyone's 
attention by digitally creating and promoting a mythical ufo base off the coast of malibu 
so yeah I mean this is just deepening the controversy here are we dealing with 
misinformation disinformation or unreliable google images it's very hard to say but we 
are still stuck with what appears to be an unusual structure off the malibu coast 
and it wasn't long before more people started to research it more recently in 2017 
rob lowe and his two sons starred in a reality tv series called the low files in which they 
investigated various paranormal and ufo claims and they eventually tackled 
this subject the malibu anomaly and on august 8 2017 decided that they would go 
off the coast of malibu and send down a little submersible submarine and see if they could 
find out whether this structure was artificial or not and they sent down this little
unmanned submarine joining with scientists and with chase klowetsky a field investigator 
from the mutual ufo network and sent down this submersible to photograph the anomaly 
and first they explored the top of the structure looking for any signs of artificial construction 
and while I found that the surface was incredibly flat they couldn't see any markings that definitively showed that this was artificially constructed and next they 
dive down to the front and the base of the anomaly unfortunately visibility at that depth was almost 
nil they couldn't really see much at all even with bright lights and they were able to get images 
of what appeared to be the foot of one of these so-called pillars as seen on google images 
but could not find any evidence that this was artificially built artificially constructed this 
was just a one or two day long operation so wasn't really given the time money and effort it deserves 
to fully make I think definitive conclusions as to the nature of this anomaly but it was the first 
attempt as far as I know for anyone to send any type of submersible down there to check it out
unfortunately the evidence I think is inconclusive but mufon of course 
joined the hunt chase klowetsky was a part of this team and she eventually wrote an article for mufon 
along with carrie mcclure and the title of the article was the malibu 
underwater base investigation as seen on the low files and as uh chase klowetsky and kerry 
mcclure write the malibu underwater alien base allegation has been under active investigation 
and research by many mufon investigators for several years starting as early as 2014. 
actually I was researching it well before 2014 all the way back in the late 1980s I wish they would 
have contacted me I could have given them quite a bit of information about the ufo reports in this 
area uh but uh chase kowitzky did do some really interesting investigations she contacted the 
nearby naval base port wai nimi point magu naval base which is located just north of this area 
and asked them if they were aware of the malibu anomaly she spoke with an officer who told her 
of course uh they were absolutely aware of this underwater uh anomaly or as they called 
it underwater base rumors and uh they told her that it was not a base but was the result of 
an earthquake thrust fault but because of this they keep the area under very close observation
and chase kletsky and mufon researchers investigated the images provided by the 
low files investigation into this anomaly and as uh koletsky writes no evidence of an opening 
nor pillars were visible there were no signs of typical man-made construction as in straight 
lines corners or 90-degree angles no machine markings were seen and nothing was found that 
would indicate or allow suspicions of man-made artifacts or construction on the sycamore null 
the scientific study and examination confirmed a natural geological formation that is consistent 
with the geological features of the california coastline the final conclusion of the mufon 
special assignment team investigator chase klowetsky is that the google satellite image of the alleged malibu underwater alien military base 
is a natural thrust fault that features all of the expected characteristics of a geological formation 
in an appropriate area such as the doom and santa monica faults the columns that are present in the 
images but do not actually exist are an artifact of the google earth satellite imaging construction 
process well i'm not sure how they can definitively conclude that especially when the 
low investigation the rob lowe investigation was really done on a shoestring budget and was very 
brief and didn't have the technology to really pierce into the visibility 
that was down there so I am not sure that they can really conclude that this was artificial or not 
so they concluded that this was a natural formation uh anyway 
and i'm honestly not so sure i'm still on the fence about it for a few reasons 
uh there was another interesting development in this case in 2014 when a ham radio operator in malibu began to pick up strange radio signals which were around 
54 kilo cycles on a 12 meter radio band and according to him they were steady as a rock 
and sounded like they were being transmitted from next nextdoor and he's an electronics and radio 
expert and a former navy officer robert stanley interviewed the gentleman and these radio signals 
seem to be coming from exactly where this malibu anomaly is located so that's really interesting 
uh here's where the story gets even stranger musician meryl fankhauser who's probably 
best known for his hit song wipeout a very successful musician is also a part of this whole
story I actually corresponded with meryl thankhauser because he was 
had friends who would go down to the malibu area and watch these lights coming in and out of the 
water meryl fankhauser confirmed this to me and so we stayed in correspondence for a little while 
and after hearing about these strange radio signals he was also intrigued and eventually 
started incorporating them into his music and he learned more about them as meryl fankhauser 
says the old world war ii expert who recorded the signals had a range finder and zeroed in 
on where the signals were coming from and it was exactly where the underwater structure was 
he didn't even know it was there until he started investigating he thought it was some navy 
submarine activity at first meryl fankhauser incorporated these strange beeping tones 
into his album signals from malibu and messages from the dome and as fankhauser writes both have 
gotten a lot of radio play here and in europe interesting thing the sounds and messages from 
the dome shut down four radio stations i'm having an engineer at skywalker ranch analyzed the sounds 
fang hauser appeared on the bob hieronymous 21st century radio show and 
was on that show bob hieronymus played some beeping tones provided by contactees and as meryl 
fankhauser says these tones were quote almost the same meryl fankhauser appeared on a radio show to 
promote his album and he also received some interesting information about this as he says 
i was on a big clear channel radio interview a year or so ago we were talking about signals from 
malibu and I mentioned the underwater anomaly was not too far from point magu naval based 
the host knew somebody at the base and called them on the air when asked about the anomaly 
and the strange radio signals the guy at the base said I can't talk about that and hung up
another clue that there might be more to this comes from researcher ken pfeiffer 
who said that this malibu anomaly may actually be being used by the u.s military as ken 
pfeiffer says I was told this by a high-ranking navy command officer that there are three 
tunnels from malibu to china lake he also told me that there is a city on the ocean 
floor with about 100 families my relative held a navy ranking just below rear admiral
another account of a whistleblower uh comes from a blogger on the internet known as agent k 
who wrote an article titled is there a uso base near catalina island 
and as he writes in this article I don't want to get too deep into the history of these sightings 
since researchers like preston dennett from mufon have already done a fantastic job of that 
his compilation of 50 of the best reports from the area is well worth the read and provides a great 
timeline of key events but most interesting to me was that he interviewed a lady he calls martha 
who is a government whistleblower claiming that there is in fact an undersea base which uh has 
not only humans but ET's working along together according to agent k and I quote she continued on 
to states the military is directly involved with these aliens and they even have an underwater base 
in the san pedro basin near catalina island where they work with the grays so the blogger agent k 
and martha were talking and martha asked him if he was familiar with the grays and he said yes 
of course and asked her how she had obtained this information about this so-called undersea 
base and she told him that she had heard it from different sources over the years and that it was 
all true and added that much of the information is available on the internet so it's safe to discuss 
and agent k said that perhaps the alien presence would be disclosed to the public 
and martha the whistleblower said oh I wouldn't be surprised at all they've been here for a very long time and as agent k writes in his article 
so here again we have a highly intelligent professional who was employed in a classified 
position with a military contractor who supports the theory of a possible uso base near catalina 
island in a very matter-of-fact manner she's elderly but still quite tech savvy and with no 
apparent reason to make up a story like this martha strikes me as further confirmation of 
something decidedly extraterrestrial lurking in the waters off long beach
so ultimately um now that we've gathered all the information on this so-called malibu anomaly i'm 
still unable to decide personally whether it's artificial or not I remain on the fence about it 
i find it very intriguing but i'm not really willing to say for sure that this is absolutely an 
under c base or even a tunnel until we have further confirmation I did write 
about this of course in my book undersea ufo base an in-depth investigation into uso activity in 
the santa catalina channel this book is all about all these this malibu anomaly all the eyewitness 
reports and all the information i've been able to gather over a period of well over two decades 
uh pointing towards the possibility of an undersea ufo base in this area and I think i've built a 
pretty compelling argument that something very unusual is going on here at the very least so it 
is what it is maybe there's a base there maybe it isn't maybe this is a natural phenomena maybe it's 
artificially constructed even if it is natural could very well be a tunnel that is in use by ETs 
or even the us government at this point I don't think we really have enough information to decide 
one way or the other an interesting endnote to all of this comes again from merrill fankhauser 
who contacted me again after learning some really interesting information meryl fankhauser was 
in las vegas and had the opportunity to speak with a native american elder this native american 
gentleman was part of the chumash tribe the gabriolano native americans who have lived 
in this area off the southern california coast for thousands of years and they have a long oral 
tradition stretching back and the subject of ufos came up leading to this malibu anomaly and the 
native american elder told meryl fankhauser that yes they are absolutely aware of this structure 
and that according to their history their oral tradition this structure used to be above water 
when the sea level was much lower thousands of years ago and that they did not build it so the 
implication was that this was in fact artificial they said the sea level was so low that they could 
sit on the edge of this thing and fish off of it so that's a little interesting data point 
which I thought would share which again points towards the possibility that this is in fact 
an undersea ufo base I don't know I will leave it to for you to decide i've presented the evidence 
as far as I know it and yeah I find it intriguing but ultimately inconclusive and I am eager 
to learn more for sure hopefully time will provide more answers we will see but that's 
it for now I hope you've enjoyed this episode I want to thank you once again for watching I 
really appreciate it keep searching keep looking for answers and most importantly keep having fun
