UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE SEVEN
Jan 3, 2025

Summary:
Jan 3, 2025
Now introducing UFOs In Your Hometown: Episode Seven. This ongoing series began with a challenge: name any town or city, and I bet I can find a UFO case there. The response has been tremendous. More than 700 locations were received. And so far, I have found UFO cases in every town and city I have investigated. Sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences – all are represented. And supporting them is a wide variety of evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, photos and videos, landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Today we explore seven new locations, supplied by you, the viewers. These locations include Folsom, California; Napier, New Zealand; Bountiful, Utah; Hickory, North Carolina; Evansville, Indiana and Kalispell, Montana. Have UFOs been seen in your hometown? The answer is almost certainly, yes!

FOLSOM, CALIFORNIA. On August 17, 1960, witnesses observed a UFO hover over the city for two hours. Throughout 1972, numerous witnesses observed UFO activity over Folsom Lake. This location would regularly produce more encounters over the years, including all the way up to 2016. A very dramatic sighting of a rare “daylight disc” occurred along Highway 50 when two women were buzzed in their car by a low flying craft.

NAPIER, NEW ZEALAND. An early Napier sighting occurred in 1952 when a trucker observed a fleet of six objects traveling in a row across the sky. In 1953, a group of boy-scouts described their encounter with a very strangely-shaped UFO. In 1955, more than 20 people driving through Napier pulled off the road to observe a brilliant green UFO. Two years later in 1957, multiple independent witnesses saw a UFO on the same day. Activity continued in 1961, 1967 and in 1968, when a low flying UFO resulted in a witness being taken to court for reckless driving. A sighting of a landed UFO in 1969 caught the attention of researchers as it involved strange landing traces. Major sightings continued, making it clear that Napier is of great interest to UFOs.

BOUNTIFUL, UTAH. Although this city is fairly large, it has produced only a few significant UFO cases. One occurred in 1969 when two young men observed two UFOs while attending a late-night movie at a drive-in theater. A sighting on October 10, 2019 of multiple objects received considerable attention from researchers as the witness was able to obtain videotape of strange lights over the city.

HICKORY, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1952, two independent witnesses both observed a classic saucer move at high speed over the city. In 1959, a witness reported being chased by a glowing blue object in his car outside of Hickory, while numerous people in town and outside of it called police to report UFOs. In 1978, five young ladies reported a UFO circling over the local college. More cases of UFOs chasing cars down Hickory Highways occurred in 1980 and 1983.

MCKINNEY, TEXAS. In 1956, more than a hundred people, including the mayor of the city, reported a UFO which hovered over McKinney for six hours. In 2008, an entire family was driving to a soccer match and all observed a strange cigar-shaped craft. In 2018, a couple reported the landing of a UFO in the field behind their home. It turned out that they had prior sightings and perhaps deeper levels of contact.

EVANSVILLE, INDIANA. In 1953, a young boy saw a spherical-shaped craft with humanoids looking down at him through portholes. Police were called who reportedly opened fire on the object. One night in 1955, a group of students observed strange green-skinned humanoids run across the playing field of a local high school. Major sightings occurred in 1957, 1959 and in 1963 when three people were in their car when it was disabled by a low-flying craft. Sightings continued in 1968, 1970, 1973 and in 1974 when a famous news-anchor reported his sighting of a craft, and four people say they were abducted by a UFO. More sightings occurred regularly, in 1975, 1976, 1978 and onward, including a 2008 sighting of a craft that was so close, the witnesses called it the scariest moment of their lives.

KALISPELL, MONTANA. In 1956, a UFO hovered over the nearby mountains for so long that the Air Force scrambled six Starfire fighter jets to investigate. Through the 1970s, numerous people reported a wide variety of sightings over Kalispell, some who were so impressed by their sightings, they reported them to UFO centers. Evan as late as 2019, UFOs were being seen over Kalispell.

The cases speak for themselves. UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen everywhere on this planet. Name any location, and you can be sure that UFOs have been seen there. UFO encounters are far more common than most people think. In fact, the huge number of cases coming from all over the world show that the ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity campaign to announce their presence. They want us to know that we are not alone!

Hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal I
truly appreciate it today's episode is called UFOs in your hometown this is a
continuing Series where I explore various locations provided by you guys
so this is episode 7 UFOs in your hometown episode 7 I'm having a lot of
fun doing these episodes I always learn a lot they're a bit different from most that I do and I get to cover a lot more
cases in fact in this episode I cover more than 100 separate UFO incidents and
the Seven locations I am exploring today include fsam
California Napier New Zealand Bountiful Utah Hickory North Carolina mckin Texas
Evansville Indiana and finally Kalispel Montana
these seven locations really delivered thank you guys for suggesting them they
cover the full range of encounters including sightings Landings onboard
experiences as well as face-to-face encounters with humanoids so really all types of UFO encounters quite a wide
variety of cases and what's also super interesting is yes these cases go way back into
history pretty much right up to the current day but the have a lot of really
compelling evidence so we have cases involving photographs cases involving
radar returns as well as Landing traces physiological effects electromagnetic
disturbances animal reactions and more a lot of evidence to support all these
cases and again one of the reasons I'm really doing this is to prove that UFOs
are being seen everywhere on this planet name a location name a town or city and
pretty sure I can find a case there haven't lost yet please have mercy on me
if you're going to provide another location for me to explore because my list is now well over 700 locations but
I'm working my way through it so let's just get started and the first location I'm exploring today is fsam California
this is by special request from DF Smith so thank you DF I truly appreciate you
participating I found some interesting cases for you I will say they're all
what we would call Close Encounters of the first kind sightings but there's some really interesting ones some
multiple witness cases and one is just a wow kind of sighting very closeup
daylight sighting where a UFO buzzes a car at very low level I think you'll find it interesting the first case I
found in folsome occurred on August 17 1960 when an object with two bright
lights in the front and red lights in the rear was seen hovering over the city
for two full hours during this time Witnesses said it was making a whining
noise quote like a spinning top unfortunately there's no other info on
that case but certainly interesting now throughout
1972 a lady who lived in a rural area located about 3 miles from fulam Lake
kept noticing that her dogs and horses would get restless and she'd look out the window and she would see one or more
glowing objects so when this would happen she'd call her brothers who would
often come over to see the UFO themselves and as one of the brothers says my two brothers and I would drive
out to her house often during the middle of the night many times we would see the object before arriving at her house so
the brother says this happened many many times these objects would be seen typically late at night or during the
very early morning hours they were always completely silent and the brother
says that one of the best sightings occurred when they were standing at the very edge of the lake and they saw
numerous of these objects hovering then moving erratically and at one point he
says and I quote one such object actually shot a beam of light directly
onto the water we could see the ripples of the lake water once the beam of light
penetrated the lake now a second memorable sighting with these folks occurred in 1972 once again after
receiving a call from his sister the brother parked along Sierra College Boulevard and watched six or seven
glowing orange orbs moving towards a larger glowing object and appeared to
enter it they would then reappear and events would start all over again and as
the witness says we watched this phenomena repeat itself for nearly an hour as I recall what we saw wasn't
certainly anything that is easily explained now here's another very
impressive closeup encounter which occurred just before noon on August 6th
1980 the Witnesses are Phyllis yumura and Joan bofer they were driving north
on folson Boulevard just before it goes under Highway 50 you can see it here
when Phyllis looked up and saw a strange craft and she pointed to it and said
what's that over there is that an airplane so her friend Joan looked at it and said no I don't think so and this is
when the object suddenly dropped from the sky and headed right for them and Phyllis shouted out it's coming at us
and Joan says and I quote and it was right towards us and then there it was
right above us no more than 10 or 15 feet above us was kind of saucer-like
but more oval more oblong than round the exterior was silver and had these little
holes in the bottom and looking up into them all you could see was Blackness it wasn't making any noise at all it was
just there hovering over our heads now Joan is a good witness she worked as a
secretary at Aero Jet's Minuteman missile program Phyllis is also a good
witness she was an executive secretary in the quality control office at the same company and as Jones says I
wouldn't make up any tale like that I don't know what it was but it was not an airplane and it was not a helicopter
another interesting case comes from new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center and involves five witnesses who they say
at 700 p.m. on August 24 2005 were boating at falam Lake a lot of cases at
this particular location now these Witnesses were in their boat parallel to folsome Dam when right above the dam
they saw a quote white cylindrical craft said was almost directly above them as
the witness says it appeared still at first then slowly moved away from the dam in no way did it appear to be a
plane was in the sky for a good minute when our friend fell in the water we
took our eyes off of the craft for no more than 5 seconds then when we looked back it had disappeared
so 10 minutes later as they were returning to the dock they saw this strange object again and as the witness
says suddenly the same craft was directly above us it had appeared there
in practically an instant then it moved toward the dam at a faster speed we
eventually lost sight of The Craft but following this sighting they did see a
helicopter up here and apparently follow the path of the craft they had the impression it was looking for it and
here is another case from falam Lake this one occurred on June 4th
2016 was around 7:45 p.m. and a man was walking his dog in this area when he saw
a quote circular object he said it was stationary in the sky just below the
cloud layer and after watching it for about 5 minutes and unable to identify
it he went to his house nearby and got a pair of binoculars and as he says as I
viewed the object with my binoculars I could see a slight glint or light on the western side of the object suddenly the
object vanished I had the strange feeling that the object knew I was observing it when it disappeared so
there you go DF Smith not a whole lot of cases but definitely some interesting ones all the way up to 2016 as well so
fairly recent found it super interesting that a couple of them were in the same exact location falam Lake UFOs do seem
to be attracted to bodies of water and certainly lots of cases of UFOs over
dams and hydroelectric stations and this kind of thing so there's a pattern there for sure now let's move to the next
location Napier New Zealand this is by special request from Alan Roser and I
have to thank you Alan because I found some really interesting cases in this one more than a dozen including one case
that actually resulted and a person going to court so that case is
particularly interesting but yeah some really amazing encounters the first
significant face that I could find in Napier New Zealand occurred at 3:30 a.m.
on December 16 1952 the main witness was Cedric burkel
a logging contractor and he was driving on the too road towards Napier when he
noticed six cigar shap glowing objects quite large he says each was about the
apparent size of a full moon and they were scooting through the sky in a straight line as Cedric says I stopped
the truck thinking that I was tired and that perhaps my eyes were playing tricks
I walked around the truck and then looked again the objects were still there six of them traveling one behind
another they were yellow in color and were traveling on a course horizontal to the Sea suddenly they lifted still in
the same formation and without changing the regularity of their spacing and continued on as before he said they were
moving pretty slowly maybe 30 to 40 mph but were quite high up 10,000 to 15,000
F feet altitude and he watched them for about 5 minutes until they disappeared
off into the distance it was one year later 6:30 p.m. on June 3rd 1953 when a
group of Boy Scouts at napers saw a yellow white glowing object they
estimated it was about 7,000 ft in altitude moving towards the north but
per the Boy Scouts the object had a very unusual shape and quote resembled a
chair so I don't know what the heck that was but sightings continued two years
later on the night of November 22nd 1955 more than 20 people along the
embankment Road between Napier and West Shore stopped to observe a brilliant
green sphere which they said was hovering stationary in the sky among the Witnesses were Mr D McDonald and his
family they were part of a convoy of vehicles who actually pulled over off the road and watched as this sphere
began to revolve it changed to a red color it then moved behind a cloud and
out the other side moving to the east slowly all in total it remained in view
for about 5 minutes when suddenly it moved off at a terrific speed which
pretty much ruled out any explanation such as plane planet star or other
conventional object or recognizable phenomenon 2 years later there was a rare daylight disc sighting this
occurred at 11:00 a.m. on January 6 1957 the main witness is Mrs MC Edwin
and she reported her citing of what she described as a dark round craft silhouetted against a white cloud
directly over Napier she watched it as it quote executed two quick wide turns
and then with a wide curve disappeared eastwards now that same day exactly 12
hours later at 11:00 p.m. a Mr Hatton of Napier described his sighting of a quote
ball of red fire like a flaming onion he said he watched it for 5 minutes as it
changed from Red to yellow and then appeared to eject three smaller objects
at this point all four moved off in the direction of Bay View and were lost to
sight the next significant sighting that I could find occurred at 3:15 p.m. on
May 23rd 1961 the witness is eem church who was
on choser road sitting on her doorstep when as she says and I quote I saw a
round silvery object in the sky it was very large and shaped like one of those round rubber rafts or a flower balll it
appeared from a Northerly Direction and moved very slowly in a straight line until it reached the Beacon's Airdrome
then it suddenly disappeared I watched for a long time but it did not reappear
now a very widely viewed sighting over Napier apparently seen by crowds of people occurred from 910 to 9:35 p.m. on
August 25 1967 an object that was described as bright
orange pink oblong in shape and flashing lights and
transparent was seen hovering over the city they said it appeared over a hill
moving like a rocket it was twice the size of a normal star some did say was
shaped like a parachute but as it moved over Napier it divided into two and then
disappeared over or into the ocean one witness said he watched it through
binoculars for a full 10 minutes he estimated its height at about 1,000 ft
so pretty low but among the Witnesses were five police officers so this is a
pretty well verified sighting and in fact the crew of a boat along the coast
not only saw the object they captured it on radar they did a search of the area
where they saw it go down but could find no trace of it now here is one of the most interesting and unusual cases
coming out of out of Napier and this involves 19-year-old John Da and his
friend Paul Franklin DA's encounter actually resulted in his arrest for
Dangerous driving it began with a series of sightings at 9:30 p.m. on September 6
1968 John Da and his friend Paul Franklin were driving when they noticed
20 or maybe even 30 colored lights green and red they they were quote flying
aimlessly above the dump so they pulled over to watch when they heard a quote thunderous explosion and they saw these
lights grouped together and shoot straight upwards into the sky at high speed this really impressed them they
called the police the policemen said that what he had seen was probably
flashing power cables they went back the next night there was nothing there but
two nights later on the 8th they went back there and saw a small light Rise Up
from a field hover at 1,000 ft altitude expand in size and
disappear but events came to a dramatic climax on September 10
1968 John Da and his friend Paul Franklin were driving away from the garbage dump along Springfield Road
Highway 50 when they noticed a strange red light in the sky which then turned
to a greenish color now before they knew it suddenly this object was zooming
Direct ly towards them Paul screamed out in fear bail out it's got us and in fact
this object they said buzzed the car at very close range both John and Paul
leaped from the vehicle which was still moving they estimated about 35 miles
hour Paul landed on his back John landed on his chest and the car of course
zoomed off on its own and they said this object this glowing object was hovering about 2 feet above it Paul screamed out
the light the light and covered his eyes because it was so brilliant he thought it might blind him John tried to get up
but his friend Paul stopped him and said for God's sake stay down they are after
us so off the car went on its own and it crashed into a fruit shop on Glouster
Street this was 4 to 500 ft down the road and pretty much total the car and
caused significant damage to the shop soon a crowd of people came to help the
boys who were both briefly hospitalized at Napier Hospital treated for bruises
and abrasions no serious injuries but John who was driving at the time or as
it turned out not driving ended up in court for Dangerous
driving and he pled not guilty police Constable Barry Martin bus testified
that he was at the scene and confirmed that both boys were in a quote his hysterical condition judge wkl Dugal
heard the case and ended up acquitting John Da of the charge saying that it was
clearly an accident but he then said quote most of these lights people see
have a natural cause the Flying Saucer in Hot Pursuit might have been the light
of a car coming around the corner which is a pretty ridiculous debunking
explanation given that these two witnesses said that they saw this light 2 feet over their car at any rate that's
a very interesting case and it's not the only one because one year later on the night of October 30
1969 patrol officer cudby saw a disc in a field 300 ft away apparently landed on
the ground or hovering right above it he shown his Spotlight back in fourth on it three times during which time his Patrol
dog he said became unusual excited now the officer was close enough
to hear a dull swishing sound coming from this object at this point the object made a high-pitched wine and
moved off so the officer went directly to the spot to investigate and saw that
although this field was pretty wet with Dew there was a 60t wide area where the
disc had been that was now hot and dry so it's a pretty significant Landing
Trace case one year later a October 3rd 1970 a couple was sitting in their car
along the coast at Marine parade when they saw no less than eight glowing
objects approaching from the East moving to the West at very low altitude about
300 ft they estimate they said it they moved slowly enough that they remained
visible for 20 minutes the next day three young people said that they were
driving on Magdalene Crescent when they saw four objects move in formation overhead staying in view for 30 seconds
2 months later on December 30 1970 three freighter workers by the name of Charlie
orbell John Clark and Jeff Miller noticed a strange object which they
described as long thin bright silver glistening in the sky they said it
remained stationary overhead for a good 10 minutes and then moved to the left
and then shot away at high speed there was another witness some miles away Mr
DL grindell was on olif font Road and he reported seeing what he described as a
silver white disc this was at the same time as the above sighting now the year
of 1972 was a huge year for UFOs in Napier on May 18
1972 student John Collins was at his home on Bluff Hill when he and his
mother used a telescope to observe two lights this was in the evening one of
these lights was stacked over the other and both were sending down beams of Lights appearing to search the hills in
sort of a zigzag pattern and as John says it was fantastically bright they
behaved too peculiarly to be anything normal 3 months later on August 20 1972 Chris
Barker and Mark Dobson who were members of the St Augustine church youth club
were taking some friends home when they were stopped by a girl at the corner of Meenie and Tannery roads who wanted them
to look at quote UFOs and as Chris Barker says they were over the fields
one above the other and were joining and coming apart they had revolving lights and were moving all the time so after
dropping off their friends Chris Barker and Mark Dobson returned to the site and the objects were still there but much
higher in the sky words spread quick quick ly and soon some 50 5 members of
the youth club observed these objects so pretty widely viewed and definitely
unexplained was 3 weeks later on September 14 1972 that bill Al aged 16
was at his home located at 85 laam Street in Napier when he saw a UFO from
his front porch as he says I was looking out to see when I I saw a bright
piercing light hovering up and down it moved West and then back to the original
position the object then moved up into the clouds and it looked like a dumbbell standing on end with two bright piercing
lights and a soft red pulsating light in between so going to do his milk run he
saw that this object was now hovering about 100 ft above Bluff Hill he says he
watched it for a total of 7 minutes before it disappeared one final case in Napier
occurred at 10:15 p.m. on December 30 1979 when a former World War II
serviceman and his wife were taking a walk at the beach along Marine parade
when they saw what they described as a star-like light moving and then dropping erratically downwards in a Falling Leaf
motion and then it disappeared so they thought that it might have been a meteor
but then suddenly a silver orange spherical object appeared maneuvered in a large half circle and
shot off to the South this was immediately followed by a second object which made the same maneuver and shot
off at twice the speed of the first object and joined it both objects then moved off to the South and disappeared
into the distance so clearly not a meteor or shooting star and in fact Dr
Jan deach of the New Zealand UFO studies Center interviewed the witnesses and was
unable to identify the lights and concluded that they had seen two genuine
UFOs thank you again alen Roser it was a lot of fun to explore Napier it looks
like a really beautiful place and certainly does have a lot of encounters was really hoping I could find some
humanoid cases for you I suspect there are some there but again the closer the
encounter is most people do not report it I think this is why most of the cases
we do see that our documented are Close Encounters of the first kind but it's
still proving my point that UFOs are seen everywhere on this planet now let's
move to another location which is Bountiful Utah thank you to Monkey McBean for
providing this location pretty interesting it's a fairly large city so
I really expected to find more than I did but I found only two cases nevertheless I think you will find them
interesting and compelling today the city of Bountiful has a current population of about 40,000 people but
only a few UFO reports have come from this area one that I found occurred on
May 2nd 1969 at 1120 p.m. two 19-year-old men
were at a drive-in theater actually when they saw two round yellow orange objects
hovering near North Canyon one of these objects moved rapidly rid ly to the east
the second one hovered for a few moments and then moved slowly after the other one and disappeared so these are
anomalous lights at night a bit ambiguous but apparently unexplained another Bountiful case
occurred fairly recently 9:10 p.m. October 10 2019 and this was captured on camera per
the witness and I quote I observed a cluster of approximately 50 bright
orange lights enter the atmosphere over antalope Island I thought a large meteor
had broken up in the atmosphere but then they hovered in a cluster and changed Direction toward the East the cluster of
Lights disappeared and a bright white light was left in their place hovering I
then observed several bright white lights blinking in a sequential pattern in a straight line as they hovered I
reached for my cell phone and was able to capture some of this amazing aming event so the photograph you see here is
a still frame of this and yes it just shows a light in the sky but it is
photographic evidence and in fact the case was investigated by Utah muon state
director Michael Barret who closed the case as an unknown FYI there is a military base
near there but the witness says he's familiar with the base and has never seen lights like this before turn turned
out that same day somebody videoed a cluster of bright orange lights over North Carolina and the witness was able
to see this video tape and said it was quote exactly what I saw thank you
monkey McBean that was pretty interesting yeah two cases I'm sure that there's a whole lot more there so if
anyone lives in Bountiful Utah you can send your cases my way because I know
with a city of that size there's definitely a lot more cases there but now let's move to our next location
which is Hickory North Carolina this is by special request from UFO Bigfoot
thank you UFO Bigfoot was pretty interesting North Carolina is a fairly active State I found four significant
cases again in each of these locations I'm discarding the cases that are very brief involving anomalous lights and
don't have a whole lot of information to provide uh so again this shouldn't be
considered a comprehensive listing of every single encounter on record at these locations
but certainly the significant ones so I hope you find this interesting the first
case from Hickory North Carolina that I could find occurred at 8:45 p.m. on
August 13 1952 the winess is James Stone he had
recently graduated from high school and he was outside his home located at 3127
Street Southwest in Hickory and this is when he saw a glowing orange object
which he says was about the apparent size of a full moon shaped like a disc or a mushroom and he said it was moving
on edge and it went from Horizon to Horizon in a period of about 5 Seconds
very fast he said it appeared to be at only 1,000 ft altitude and was totally
silent turns out he's not the only witness to it cuz unknown to James just
a short distance away at 137 9th Street another recent high school graduate
Larry Eisenhower saw the object as well he said he had it in view for about 4
seconds both boys reported their sighting to authorities it reached William H chambley the director of civil
defense for the city of Hickory who remained somewhat neutral about the sightings saying quote well I do not
believe that the objects cited are the so called flying saucers I am convinced that these boys actually saw some
phenomenon like a trick of atmosphere certainly a good trick next case
occurred 7 years later was around 400 a.m. on November 3rd
1959 when Robert L Jones and his friend were driving outside of Statesville
North Carolina this is about 30 miles from Hickory when they said a blue ball of light chased their car at Treetop
level for several miles and as James says I stopped six times and it stopped
six times I don't mind telling you I was scared to death now finally it darted
off and he reported it to the police and this is when they found out that numerous residents in the area including
in Salisbury and of course Hickory had also called their local police station to report unusual lights in the sky next
case I found occurred at 9:30 p.m. on March 19 1978 when five young ladies from Hickory
ranging in age from 9 to 15 years old called the police to report their
sighting of a glowing object which they saw circling above Lenoir Ry College the
group included Flo Ripley Connie Miller Tony Kylie Kelly Gwyn and Heather living
good Flo Ripley was kind of the spokesperson for the group said that the object was quote about 10 ft long with
two tails on the back had two bright white lights it went straight up and then the white lights turned to Red it
circled with no sound no noise at any time then one light turned to green and
disappeared so they watched it for about 5 minutes and this is when they called the police who they said were not very
enthusiastic about the report though it did reach newspaper reporters and was
later published in the Hickory Record newspaper 2 years later on the night of
April 10 1980 Leanne San was driving from Hickory
to Vil when she reported her sighting of a round golden sphere flying overhead no
sooner did she see it when to her shock this object came down and circled her car and proceeded to do this for the
next 30 miles all the way on her trip from Hickory to Veil
research AET investigated the incident and he learned that there were in fact other sightings in the surrounding area
on that same night UFOs do seem to have this thing about chasing cars down
lonely highways at night because it happened again 900 p.m. October 26
1983 David kener called the police to say that he saw a diamond shaped UFO
swooped down over his car as he was traveling along Highway 32 21 just
Northeast of Hickory he said this object was silent it looked red in front and
kind of green in the back and he watched it for 5 minutes as it hovered and then moved to a higher elevation and then off
into the distance and was gone theyve already covered a couple of cities in North Carolina so it doesn't surprise me
that Hickory has cases as well certainly interesting but now let's move to our
next location which is mckin Texas I actually got two requests for mcken and
they they come from friend Hollis and from Larry so this is for you guys I
found three cases two are really astonishing cases again no humanoids
little disappointed usually I do find more humanoids in each of these locations but it is what it is and again
these cases do prove that UFOs are being seen everywhere and I think you'll find these particular cases is quite
interesting and extensive here is a very important case I think which began at
300 p.m. on April 4 1956 definitely something undeniably
strange was seen for about 6 hours on that day over mckin various Witnesses described it as
a rounded silvery object with a kind of Walnut shape and it was hovering very high in a clear blue sky the main
witness is very reputable very credible he's a you s Army Captain Roy F Hall a
local weather observer in mcken and onetime mayor of the city actually he
was downtown when some Electrical Workers called his attention to this object which was hovering in the
Northwest Sky now he glanced at it didn't really take a close look and told
him it was undoubtedly a weather balloon but soon he was going to change his mind
because as Captain Hall says however on arriving home I noted the object again and was astonished to see
that it was above the serious clouds that had drifted over within the last hour knowing the clouds were at around
11,000 ft up I ran a triangulation on the object taking one reading at home
and another 3 miles north and I was amazed again to find it worked out at around 100,000 ft I took another
triangulation at home and found it at the same height some quick figuring
after ascertaining the diameter of the object it showed it to be 220 ft or
thereabouts in diameter so the chase was on he called Fort Worth weather bureau who confirmed
that they had no weather balloons in the area he called an astronomer in the area who viewed it through his telescope and
actually drew the sketch you can see here he said it had an almost silvery rubberlike appearance kind of
translucent almost it did have a very visible vertical band down the center
and it was not revolving in the sky at this point it was moving to the Southwest at about 100 mph which was
very odd because the air currents at that altitude were moving from west to east at 150 mph so Captain Hall made
various phone calls to Air Force spaces he got no answers other than that they
thought it was a weather balloon but he's a weather Observer he's very familiar with balloons he said it was
not a weather balloon was too bright too large too high and moving too strangely
to be a weather balloon and as he says I have no idea what it was long after
Sunset it glowed in the sky due to the sun's Rays it stood in the Northwest sky
from 300 p.m. until dark despite its Westward course hundreds of people here
saw it so the local police station reported that they were quote swamped
with calls so this was clearly unusual and very widely viewed people over an
area of 100 miles saw this thing now reportedly parin Air Force Base
scrambled Jets after it Captain Hall sent a letter to the Air Force and
project Bluebook got in on the ACT and ultimately labeled it unidentified but
possibly Venus or weather phenomenon 10 days later Captain Hall
was visiting the same astronomer's house and saw two red lights shoot over the horizon and he later found another
witness who on the same night said he saw three pale blue lights about 150 ft
above the ground moving at extremely high speed across the sky he estimated
about 18800 miles hour here's another pretty interesting case from mckenny
which comes from researcher Brian vik who took a report from a couple they said at 11:45 a.m. on October 18th 20 8
they were driving their kids to soccer and saw an unusual looking quote silver
metallic cigar-shaped object as they said it didn't move and it was hovering
high in the sky was not an airplane or a helicopter or a balloon it seemed to go
high up and we lost sight of it one minute it was there and the next it was gone such Are
UFOs now here is a really interesting very important case involving physical
evidence this is actually a UFO landing case which was investigated by Texas
state director for muon Gary nitel it's a case with deeper levels of
contact as we shall see because over the past year the witnesses reported seeing
strange green flashes of light in the sky weird star-like objects moving around turned out so had their neighbors
was following one of these sightings that the main witness says he woke up with odd marks on his skin which he felt
were not naturally caused you can see them here but it was really around
midnight on December 1st 2018 at this witness a mechanical engineer for a
large military defense subcontractor had an encounter that left him deeply shaken he was in his upstairs
music room for some reason got up to look out the window which faces North
over an open field and he saw something so shocking so unbelievable he could
hardly believe his own eyes as he says what I saw literally frightened me so
much that I was almost paralyzed and I could barely talk to myself I started
trembling and my eyes could not believe what they were seeing but essentially what I saw was a UFO from 500 ft away
the thing was incredibly big the first thing I thought when I saw it was
UFO now this thing was on the ground and per the witness it had a horizontal string of 20 large ice white blue lights
which were surrounded by smaller red lights the witness had the impression that the lights were deliberately
pointed at his house says the witness the color and brightness of those lights
were so clean and Powerful that I have never seen anything man-made that looks
similar so he watched an absolute shock and astonishment for a full 40 seconds
then realized he should probably get another witness he dashed downstairs to get his wife who was asleep then he ran
back upstairs with her they both looked out the window and this object was still there he estimated it was probably about
30t wide maybe 16 ft tall this point he decided to go get a pair of
binoculars and no sooner did he leave the window in the room that his wife
yelled out it's moving and she watched it move to the east very slowly and
disappeared behind the neighbor's house so some minutes later the couple got
into their car and drove around the neighborhood looking for it but it was gone the next morning they did go out
into the field and they found as you can see here crushed burned vegetation and
strange impants on the ground following this encounter they contacted muan
researcher Gary nitel who interviewed the witness is and he says that the husband quote seemed very credible and
was somewhat shaken by what he had seen they tested the area for radiation with a Geer counter found no radiation
but did confirm the landing traces and did take soil samples and samples of the
vegetation they were sent to analysis which showed quote damage from unusual
vibration frequencies as are sometimes seen in some crop circles as well as
charring of the outer membranes and as the main researcher Gary says after interviewing the witness
in person and inspecting the possible Landing or hovering site the investigators believe that some unknown
strange object had either landed in or hovered over this field so while these
are all sightings one is a landing and it does have indications of this being a much more
extensive encounter or encounters I should say so again this is just the tip of the
iceberg in each of these cases the history of UFO visitations on our planet
is far more extensive and is completely excluded from pretty much all history
books this subject is very very rarely taught in any School classrooms there
are a few cases of people being taught UFOs in school but not in regular
textbooks it's completely absent hopefully that will one day change it's one of the reasons I do this research
this is a very important subject so now let's move to our next
location which really delivered the full range of encounters I found 17 cases in
this location alone which is Evansville Indiana Indiana has got a lot of
activity I have to say so thank you Bruce Wright for suggesting this
location it was so interesting I learned a lot and I think you will find it interesting
as well I certainly hope so the first case that I found in Evansville Indiana
is an amazing one it occurred in August of 1953 it is a single witness case there's
not a whole lot of verification to it but it's so interesting that it definitely deserves to be known the
witness was 6 years old a gentleman by the name of Mr Lane and I'll just quote
him directly as he says as a child of 6 years old told I was playing in the
alley beside our home on the 400 block of Third Street in Evansville on a day
in August of 1953 my mother was in the kitchen at the sink which overlooked the alley where I
was playing I heard a loud humming sound overhead there was a large silvery
colored Globe approximately 100 ft in diameter over a tree besides the alley
about 50 ft in the air a loud humming sound was coming from it the globe had a
band of portal windows that circled around the globe humanoid Figures were
peering out these po portals watching me play My Mother seeing this craft sent
for my father to bring me in the house she called the police numerous police cars arrived in moments the police began
firing at the globe with rifles pistols and shotguns this went on for about an
hour the craft never seemed to be hit or down damaged then it finally just went
straight up into the air until it disappeared so yeah this is quite an event and the witness says that he
actually saved some of the shell Cas casings he filled them up in a large bushel basket and kept them for some
time though as a freshman in high school for some reason he just threw them away this case was investigated by a muon
field inv investigator who says and I quote Mr Lane definitely remembers his described
event as a child no record of this event has been found by the Evansville paper
and was apparently never reported by the news media at the time based on Witnesses data and response we can only
call this report quote unknown with insufficient evidence this case from
Evansville Indiana occurred on August 25 1955 which as it turns out is just a few
days after the very famous Hopkinsville case in Kentucky and really not too far
away way this one does involve humanoids Charles Thomas age 17 and several other
teenagers were at the local high school in Evansville when they said they saw strange quote Little Green Men these
clearly not human figures were running around the school's athletic field and per the witnesses they appeared bright
green almost glowing slightly had sort of a blurry or fuzzy appearance they
were quite short 4 feet tall and appeared to have webbed hands and feet but were
humanoids very curious about them the teenagers threw rocks at these creatures
who stopped stared back at them and then loped off into the darkness and were gone a very interesting case and it was
2 years later on August 7 1957 that police stations all across Central and
Eastern Indiana were flooded with calls from people reporting multicolored UFOs
red blue green pink and more one of the calls came from four teenagers who said
that they were on a camping trip in Evansville when they saw a glowing object which came right overhead stopped
in midair and seemed to give off a shower of what they called gleaming Stardust certainly an interesting case a
lot of cases in Evansville it was 2 years after this October 2nd 1959 John Smith was in his home located
at 207 South Grand Evansville when he saw a quote Flying
Saucer over his home he said it looked like quote a big silver pencil with red
tail lights he's he's a young child he said it was about 300 feet up 60 feet
long and his friend Larry Haley was with him and also of course saw the object
Larry said it looked like a quote pencil on its side with blunt ends and a flashing tail light he estimated it was
a little bit shorter 40 ft long neither of them saw any windows or markings on the object both said it hovered in
perfect silence for about 40 seconds and then as John says it went straight up
still on its side it went slowly at first and then fast within a few seconds
it was out of sight so clearly something quite unusual here's a really
interesting case involving both electromagnetic disturbances and animal reactions which occurred on the evening
of August 10 1963 and was seen by at least three people in
Evansville Marilyn webert was driving with her child and her niece who at the
time was 15 years old her niece is Rosita Galloway and they were about four
miles north of Evansville driving along broom Road when they said this glowing UFO began to circle around their car and
as Marilyn says it stayed there maybe four or 5 minutes was white and reminded
me of a flashlight but it was bigger than anything I ever saw and was so high up in the air but per Marilyn her car
engine actually failed the headlights would not go on despite repeated attempts to get the car to work it
wouldn't and dogs in the area she said were going barking like crazy Marilyn's
young child screamed when this UFO appeared very frightened hit on the floor of the car Rosita looked at it and
as she says when I looked up I Saw The Light disappearing and then the car
worked okay so this is a pretty clear-cut case of an electromagnetic
disturbance and later it was learned that dozens of people had been reporting strange activity in the sky in that area
around that time here's a sighting of a very unusual object which occurred on
the evening of September 8th 1968 a woman and her son were returned
rning by car to their Evansville home when they saw quote an odd sight as the
anonymous witness says I glanced up and saw a UFO I could see every detail at
first I thought it was an advertising gimmick was in the sky not moving and had it been more rounded and streamlined
I thought it was a blimp or the like but it was long shaped darkish in color and definitely not streamlined the object
did not appear to be tall enough in height to hold an upright man and if a human being was inside he would have
very likely had to be sitting at least a fit into the flatl looking shape the object was long however about the length
of an airplane it looked very old very heavy metal a dull brown with smudges
that appeared to have been made by great heat it was a lead color with smudges as if it had been on fire at one time it
was very ugly the thing did not seem to have Windows but along both the top and bottom there was a row of squares set
waffle likee back into the metal and along between the squares was a band
running from one end to the other so yeah that's all her description a very
unusual object not sure what is attracting UFOs to Evansville but
there's a lot of cases here's another April 20 1970 a witness was traveling
north on Route 57 when he noticed a cloud of dust in a farmer's field and
right above above it maybe 200 ft in the air was a quote silvery disc-shaped
object he estimates it was about A4 mile away and as he watched it it was
traveling parallel to the ground he was close enough that he could clearly see Port holes or Windows on top of the
craft and as the witness says I've never seen anything like this before and have
never seen anything like it since it was totally unmistakable for anything other
than a classic disc shaped UFO 3 years later November 16 1973 at 9:45 p.m. 3
teenagers described their sighting of a strange object which they watched drop
from the sky land on the ground rise up and land again and start moving along so
they ran up to it actually tried to catch this thing as it was traveling along about 10 ft above the ground and
occasionally coming even lower than that they said it had a Brown sort of electronic eye looking device on it it
had a glowing red bottom section that reminded them of a basket they did tell
their parents who reported it to authorities just a few months later January 25
1974 David Goodnow who would later become a very famous news anchor man for
CNN reported his sighting of three glittering red colored objects which he
described as being like an illuminated sign but very bright and it had smaller
white lights on each side these lights were totally silent and blinking at
random and moved to the north for several minutes reportedly the cameraman also saw them and as these objects moved
off they moved in such a way that indicated that these were actually separate objects not connected together
here's an interesting case involving missing time this comes from researcher Francis Ridge who talked to four people
who were driving at 9900 p.m. on February 9 1974 just north of Evansville
when they said a UFO came down over their car and actually levitated it upwards all four immediately lost
Consciousness when they woke up they were missing some 2 hours of time now
one of the people in the car said that he did recall seeing a human looking figure on board the UFO who somehow knew
all four of their names unfortunately I have no other information on this very interesting
case but yeah something strange is going on in Evansville year after year there
are sightings there here's another July 27 1975 Mike Webb age 12 who lived at
711 Ravenwood Drive and his friend Jeff Hatfield age 10 who lived at 414 Monroe
Street were walking home a long Riverside Drive this is when they saw a UFO which they
estimate was about 4,000 ft high and as Mike says I've never seen anything like
it before it was spinning and turning colors from blue to green to Red to
Yellow we watched it for 20 minutes just moving up and down and back and forth
then it disappeared sounds like a true honest to God UFO display to me now this next case
is a doozy franch Ridge the researcher calls this case quote one of the
strangest UFO sighting reports I've personally investigated the main witness is quite
credible his name is Lee Golden he's a former Navy man a Teamster who was very
well known in his community for his philanthropy giving away free bikes to anyone who wanted one the sighting
occurred at 7:05 p.m. on August 28th 1976 Lee was in his home on the east
side of EMT Street when this object appeared and as Lee says this is no hallucination this thing
came right over the top of the house I'd say 100 to 150 ft over the top of the
house it was rectangular on top and it had a big light at the bottom there
wasn't any noise at all as it came over it was gaining altitude and it was heading north when it got way up in the
air something shot out of the bottom of it something shot out of it later on so
you can see the drawing here as Lee Golden says the object had a rectangular-shaped cage of some sort on
the top portion and it looked very clearly like some sort of cylinder or entrance from top to bottom located in
the middle I also noticed what appeared to be a door or heavy screened opening at the top part located in the middle
the lights had a yellow cast and went to White the object was moving very slow at first and then seemed to stop head from
due north to Northeast took on a quick speed went up a good distance ejecting
something went higher up and did this again so he was not the only witness
five other people besides Lee also saw this object which they estimate was in view for about 15 minutes before
departing certainly a very unusual sighting of a very unusual object 2
years later April 7 1978 three boys saw what first appeared to be twoo light
but quickly this became four lights and then a blue light appeared between all of these and flashed seven or eight
times at the same time made a significant beeping sound the witnesses
said this object was huge about as big as a jet and very low maybe 200 to 300
feet high they were close enough 200 250 ft away that they got a pretty good look
at whatever this was they were not able to identify it another interesting case
one night in January or February 1980 a registered nurse was walking her dog not
too far from grass Regional Airport when she said she saw this motionless shiny
aluminum looking object very low in the sky not much higher than the Treetops
she kept her eye on it because it looked unusual kind of blimp like but didn't look like a blimp so she was really
wondering what it could be and it remained in the sky for a long time and was still there when she returned home
and finished walking her dog she said had a row of lights or Port holes and was totally silent but yeah not a blimp
she didn't think the next morning in fact she was so intrigued by it she decided to call the airport who seemed
especially interested in her report and as she says the airport people asked me
many questions so I knew then it was a UFO this next case comes from a letter
written to Jay Allen HCK about a UFO seen at 8:45 p.m. on July 23rd
1981 in her letter to Jen heinik the witness an betulus who you can see here
writes that she was fishing from a rowboat when she saw a ball of light like an oversized Moon an estimated 10
to 12 ft in diameter so it was pretty big and as Anne says when I first saw
the reflection of it in the water it was moving from East to West it was on the
other side of some trees so I thought it was an optical illusion and was a helicopter some distance away but there
was no sound I continued fishing and I have no concept of how much time elapsed
before it came over the trees from the East I caught the light out of the corner of my eyes and turned to see the
object moving over the Treetops and move slowly towards the lake it seemed to
come about three feet off the ground and about four or five feet from the edge of the water just stood still and was
making no sound and did not change color or brightness began to move slowly away
back over the trees towards the east just opposite of its approach she said it moved very slowly very smoothly and
then was gone she does say that both she and her husband had seen unusual Bright Lights earlier on several prior
occasions but didn't think too much of it until she had this very close encounter here's another very unusual
sighting which occurred at 3:30 a.m. M on September 6th 1986 the witness is known only as Mr P
he heard this very loud sound like a jet and turning around he and his friend saw
a huge long skinny object lower than Treetop level moving at about 3 mph past
them very slowly they saw it come out from behind a tree and then started to
move behind the house but this object was so long they estimated about 55 ft long maybe 6 ft in diameter that they
never saw the whole thing it was still coming out from behind the tree as it moved off behind another house and this
was just 1,000 ft away very close it was roughly cigar shaped they said it had
red blue and green lights had what looked like fins on it now earlier that
same evening three other people in Evansville had seen four extremely red
brilliant lights moving in formation for about 15 seconds and one of the witnesses said we were a stricken at
their Brilliance so I'm not sure about the first sighting there but very
interesting here's one also really interesting 9:45 p.m. May 29
1991 four Witnesses saw a craft that they said was sort of stingray shaped
moving very slow and steadily at a low altitude 200 ft overhead and was covered
with light about 15 lights they estimate yellow green red remained in view for
about 2 minutes before moving off now one final case for Evansville this is so
interesting a couple were driving down Morgan Avenue were into Evansville this
was at 9:30 p.m. on August 17 2008 and this is when they noticed a few cars had
pulled over and we're looking over the nearby cornfields so this intrigued them
and looking in that direction they saw two very unusual bright yellowish lights
just above and in front of a nearby Grove of trees so they moved onto a side
road to get a closer look and this is when the witness's boyfriend said it's moving towards us so they stopped the
car frightened until this object started moving away and then they followed it again next thing they knew they come
around the corner and it's very close and they can now see that it was quote
this big long fat cigar shaped thing was huge lights were going down the sides of
it and they were going in a row down the side I was so scared we couldn't believe
what we were seeing this thing was the size of an airplane shaped like an airplane without any Wings a big fat
whitish cigar was so close to us went down behind the trees looking like it
was Landing but it made absolutely no noise I kept telling my boyfriend go go
go he drove fast and finally we made it back to the main Highway the witness did
say that these lights were really unusual and had this weird way of flickering down the sides but as she
says quote it was the scariest night of our Lives it changed my life thank you
again Bruce Wright that was amazing I always learned stuff just when I think I've heard it all a new case comes along
that really makes me scratch my head and say what is going on here it's amazing
to me our planet is being visited so much it's it's really astonishing I'm
surprised that this isn't Front Page News every day it's starting to get there we're definitely making strides
towards this subject going mainstream and being fully accepted but I don't think we're where we need to be yet so
let's go to the last and final location in this little collection which is Kalispel Montana some really important
cases in this one thank you brilliant design for suggesting this location such
a beautiful area really loved exploring these cases there's a couple of here that are very significant I also found
some audio recordings so you get to hear directly from the witnesses themselves which always makes this more interesting
so let's see what Kalispel Montana has to offer the first cisel Montana
encounter to get any widespread publicity was a really dramatic sighting that definely caught the attention of
the Air Force began at 9:20 p.m. on September 3rd
1956 when a gentleman by the name of Eddie GS he's a former commander of the Civil Air Patrol he and his wife noticed
a brilliant orange object hovering in the sky as they were driving into Kalispel so he stopped his car got out
and watched this object move partly across the sky slow down turn to the north he and his wife watched it fade
change position move South gain altitude as he says it was circular and very
bright he described it as being almost bull-shaped and was so bright it was sending out little fingers or rods of
light said it would flare up and then fade out at times he said it moved ir radically and with great speed so he
could see that this was very unusual and he started to call other people once he got into town as he says he did this
quote so that I wouldn't be the only only one who had gone berserk he called
off-duty fireman Charles Hathaway who observed it through a spotting scope and described it as quote extra brilliant he
informed the ground Observer core Tower who related to the Air Force filter Center one go member said it was
infinitely brighter than any other planet she had ever observed and she told the Air Force emphatically that
this was not a planet so a lot of people were viewing this thing finally at 10:30
p.m. Sergeant Carl Clark was notified he observed the object saying it was quote
triangular in shape with a bright yellow glow with him was Sergeant John delesio
who agreed upon the description they estimated was hovering at about 4,000 ft
maybe 7 mil Southwest of Kalispell they watched as it moved slightly back and
forth and then East and West both said it had a metallic appearance others
described it as having having a tear shape some said it looked a little fuzzy or hazy some described it having a
little bit of a tail to it several witnesses said it appeared to flash colors sometimes red sometimes green or
white finally at 12:45 a.m. this is hours into the
sighting five Starfire jet interceptors arrived from Malmstrom Air Force Base to
intercept the object which by now had moved slowly down the range of mountains
a cap Commander saw it and he said it was dangling back and forth and jerking up and down at high speed this object
was still clearly visible though it did not appear on radar now the Jets couldn't find it because it would
apparently fade from sight when they appeared and there was also some cloud cover which made vectoring into this
object difficult so what was weird about this
is the cloud cover wasn't that dense when said that they could see the stars
through the clouds so apparently this object was blinking out when the Jets
approached Eddie GS the original witness said he watched this object until 2
a.m. but it turns out the Air Force officers who were watching this
thing said it remained in view till about 5 or 5:30 a.m. at which point they saw it move off to the West though there
are some reports it moved off to the east so there's some conflicting reports here but at any event it disappeared
with daylight of course debunkers came out a Montana University astronomer tried to
explain away the sighting as Mars apparently ignoring the fact that ground Observer core members Eddie GS and
others saw this thing moving Eddie of course disagreed with the astronomer and
said I'm no astronomer but I know that stars don't travel north and south I
mean this thing was visible for at least 7 to 8 hours and you can see the blue
book reports here they treated this thing very seriously spent quite some time investigating it and again
scrambled Starfire Jets after it which you probably wouldn't do for something
like Mars or anything conventional But ultimately and get this Air Force
Project Blue Book wrote that quote after a full investigation of this sighting
this headquarters concur URS with the investigating officer that the sighting was caused by the planet Mars such a
shame Blue Book is clearly not an investigative body that we can take
seriously quite a few sightings in Callis spell here's another 11:15 p.m. on June 24
1964 Douglas Duncan and his wife were watching TV when suddenly their TV set
quote went crazy so they ran outside and were amazed to see a formation of
objects a whole Echelon moving very low on the horizon to the southwest and as
Douglas says the objects looked like long fat cigars at the angle where we
saw them at each end was a bright light between the two bright end lights were
evenly spaced smaller lights here's a drawing which they said looked very similar to what they saw they watched
them for about 5 minutes until they moved out of sight another spell witness
is Betty Lee Jones she became very interested in UFOs after having many sightings throughout the early 1970s she
saw many UFOs not only her but the people around her and as Betty says we
had become so used to these lights that we never bothered to report them she
ended up documented many of these anomalous light sightings one
particularly interesting one occurred on January 2nd 1973 when as Betty says I again saw a red
cigar-shaped object seven of us saw this one I watched it through binoculars and could see the shape here is a sighting
of a UFO which occurred just after midnight on August 11 1976 over CIS
spell which caused at least four people to call the police each caller said that
they saw this glowing object which would change colors as it moved across the sky
that same year September 18 1976 a Callis spell Resident called the
National UFO Reporting Center to describe her sighting of two UFOs now I'd like to play for you a
little audio tape of this witness calling the National UFO Reporting Center this audio tape lasts about five
minutes but I think you'll find it quite interesting well this was uh like she said 2:00 last well it would have been
Saturday morning and uh I saw it from Summers which is was about oh 10 or 15 mil from
the mountain range and uh it was a big orange Globe up on top of the highest peak and uh there was a separate orange
glow on this side of the which would have been on the west side of the mountain uhhuh and uh oh I probably
watched that for maybe 10 minutes 5 or 10 minutes I don't know and then from
the East side came two great big headlights in the middle of this big orange glow
coming up over the mountains from the East side now they came out of the glow
they came it was like this like this orange glow was one big one big light
Ray okay and then these two huge headlights right in the center okay come
up over the mountain towards me this smaller orange blob on this side of the
mountains moved up and joined forces with this other what Riv that was coming
over the mountain you mean they merged yes okay and then it was kind of a uh a
thinner Ray which I assume it was turning around when these two joined and then it went back East back
over on the other side of the mountain and then I could see the the black
silhouette of the mountain against this light Ray this orange orange globe and
then it started moving to the South and up high okay and we watched I
watched it for probably a half hour all to okay now the largest glow the uh the
highest one did that have any particular shape no it didn't no just a large glob
of light right okay uh-huh now how about the smaller one the smaller one uh they
laugh at me the only way I can describe it is uh one of these wine canvas wine
containers that they squirt wine into their mouth you know yes that that's the only thing I can think of okay that sort
of a shape uhhuh it was kind of a kind of a pearshaped yes and I don't remember
whether the peak of that pearshaped object was connected to the other or not
I I don't know I can't say that it was and I can't say that it wasn't okay now in comparison uh how much smaller was
the small object in compared to the large one oh the smaller one was uh it was was it was very small compared to
the big orange glow okay do you have any estimate of how big the other one was could you compare it with any object if
you can imagine a big orange light behind the on the other side of the peak
of Mount rineer uhhuh something something like that I mean it was it it
lit up the sky to a certain extent you could see streets of white clouds and then dark and then white clouds but uh
but the the sky was just light it it wasn't an orange reflection that far up to see the clouds the the orange was
pretty well centered around the top of the mountain did the intensity of that light remain the same at all times yes
it did did it reflect itself off the surface of the ground at all that you could see not that I could I I finally
went in and and uh woke up my sister because there has been a lot of talk in that area of seeing these objects uhhuh
and then she watched it with me for another 15 20 minutes as it moved South
up but you can see the light reflection well we've been getting quite a few calls from uh Northwestern Montana is
that right up around Libby and cisel and Missoula and so forth just a few months
later on February 27 1977 new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center received
another call from Kalispel the witness in this case was a civil engineer and he described his
sighting of a translucent looking sort of Saturn shaped object with sparkling
lights and I'd like to play for you a 5 minute long audio recording of his call
to the National UFO Reporting Center uh I live about 12 miles Northwest of
Kaliso Montana yes sir last night I cited a strange object in the sky and it
was there for so long my wife first cited I have a scope of 75 power and 30
to 75 power I had a set for 35 power and I looked at this thing it hovered over
about I would judge it from the landscape here uh somewhere over tally
Lake and uh I wondered if you want to an idea of what I saw through my
scope interest to you uh what did this thing look like it was a sere uhhuh uh
rather uh like it be translucent with um some little uh some
lights in the sphere itself uh with a Sparkle something like you'd see in a Christmas tree light oh
yes and at the at the time it was when it would stay uh
stationary it would have a Halo which was exactly like the fluorescent light
you the circular fluorescent lights and as it Rose or descend as it Rose especially
the uh this uh tubular light around the uh when it was stationary was right on
the diameter of the sere right I see and as it Rose the the circular light the
tubular looking light would uh uh G down to the bottom of the sphere and when it
disappeared from side which appears like it was moving horizontally away from us it would disappear the the light would
uh uh contract and disappear as it hit the bottom of the sphere well when the
um when it was in horizontal position with the soal tubular light around the
diameter and the sphere was I say it was just an outline it was rather almost translucent
as if uh there wasn't as much reflection coming off did whatever else is on it
yes um uh it was brilliant uh when it was it uh the
diameter of the spere but as it uh as it Rose in the as it Rose um of the Horizon
the um the light kept getting dimmer and dimmer which direction you look I say this uh this uh uh band of light around
the diameter at the Brilliance would be about 12th the diameter of the sphere that I observed okay and which direction
were you looking I was looking uh du West I I approximately du West okay now
and this object uh came up from the Horizon uh when I first noticed it it
was in the horizontal position uh just above the Horizon we're down in Little Valley and uh we had m Mountain out
there about 5,000 ft yes it was somewhere 5 6,000 ft and we're at 3,000 hey did your wife see this too yes she
was the one that noticed didn't tell you the truth I was sleeping from the fireplace she woke me up because of this brilliant light that was just above the
Horizon as we look West over Mountain there were no other stars in the sky okay you had a cloudy condition then yes
okay did this thing uh did the light from this thing illuminate the clouds at all
well uh just some extent there was a around the whole thing there was a a
Halo or ARA but uh still the distinction of the uh the spherik object was uh
quite distinct there was a definite outline where it ended okay well sir we
sure appreciate this report and we'll get on it right away and if we come up with any additional information on this why we get back to you and let you know
thank you very much sounds like you got a typical UFO in the sky there it looks like I don't know well wife and I
discussing it thought we ought to follow up okay thank you again by bye so
interesting I love hearing directly from the witness definitely sounds like an unusual sighting now let's explore one
final sighting over Kalispel this comes from cam Logan who very recently he was
around 2:30 p.m. this is a daylight sighting on March 29 2019 he was driving just west
of cisel when he saw this sort of tic tac shaped object hovering at first
stationary in the sky he watched it for a while as he's driving he estimates it was about 700 ft up he said it first
appeared to be white but as he got a closer look he saw it looked almost gray silver with different shades and what
was really interesting is it seemed to affect the sky around it as cam says the
object was pulsating with gray white and silver I got to watch this display for
about 30 seconds and the AR object started to get smaller or slowly moved
away strangely it seemed that the portion of the blue sky around it moved
and changed there was a distortion in the Clear Blue Sky very strange it
definitely impressed him he finally found or had a drawing produced which he says looks pretty much exactly like what
he saw as you can see this is not one solid object but maybe it is but it's
got two sections it's definitely a very unusual sighting thank you brilliant
design Callis spell definitely delivered some very important cases there uh so
interesting I'm just still amazed at how many cases there are on record I think
if you go to UFO databases like muon the mutual UFO Network and newfork you'll
see that they alone have some 300,000 documented cases but if you add up other
UFO organizations like naikap and qot and Appo and then go worldwide to
countries like Australia of course in France and Spain and Italy and England
and Brazil and South America and Canada I mean we can go on and on there's some 200 countries on this planet there are
well over a million documented encounters it's probably several times
that and again those are just the documented cases the vast majority do not get reported I always ask people
when I interview them did you report your case to any official UFO organization like muon or newfork the
answer almost always is what's muon what is newfork so no people won't call the
police even or the Air Force the vast majority of these cases go unreported which is such a shame I blame our own
governments for this our intelligence agencies our military who have perpetrated a cover up on this subject a
disinformation campaign suppression of UFO evidence and information it's not
fair it can't go on the truth will come out at some point you can distort it you
can hide it you can ignore it but you will never destroy it you cannot hide
the sky truth will come out so thank you once again for watching watching you
guys I love doing these UFOs in your hometown episodes I always learn a lot
only not only about geography but about UFOs in general it's always interesting
to me also how people react the wide variety of encounters people have there's always so much to learn so thank
you for all of you who suggested these locations and again I'm happy to look up other locations just as long as you
remain aware that I am doing these in order and my list of locations is again
well over 700 locations so it's going to take me a while to get to any new
locations you guys provide but happy to do it so thank you thank you thank you I
truly appreciate you guys watching have a happy New Year and until next time
keep searching for the truth keep asking those hard questions and most important of all keep having fun I will see you
next Friday for another episode of UFOs in the paranormal bye for now
