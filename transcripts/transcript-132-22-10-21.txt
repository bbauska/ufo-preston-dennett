UFO CAR-LEFT CASES
Oct 21, 2022

Summary:
Oct 21, 2022
UFOs often behave in ways that can only be described as bizarre. One type of behavior that is familiar to most UFO investigators are UFO-car chases. In case after case, UFOs will approach a car driving down a remote highway late at night and chase them down the road. But there’s another type of behavior that goes far beyond just chasing a car. Sometimes UFOs will actually pull the car off the road and suck it up into the sky! These are known as “car-lift” cases.

For some reason, the UFO occupants just pull the car up, float it around and then set it back down, leaving the people in the car bewildered and more than a little frightened. The question is, why? The best way to get some answers is to examine the cases. This video present more than twenty UFO car-lift cases, reaching back more than sixty years up to the present day, and coming from all across our planet.

1959: four teenagers are driving outside of Goldfield, NV when their truck becomes mired in the desert sand. To their amazement, a UFO shows up and pulls their truck out.

1961: Adolpho Pisano is driving along the Andean Highway in Venezuela. Suddenly a UFO swoops down and pulls the car ahead of him into the sky.

1965: Mrs. A.V. of Brussels, Belgium loses control of her vehicle as a UFO lifts it up and carries it 150 feet forward before setting it down again.

1965: Edward Burns of Herman, MN is only two miles from his home when he comes upon a glowing red object over the road. Before he can get away, the object levitates his pickup truck and spins it 180-degrees on the highway.

1967: Martha Carnes is driving down Chicken Run Road in Madison, Indiana when a UFO (which had chased her car twice before) came after her again. This time it comes over her car and pulls it up off the ground.

1969: Barbara Smythe of Alberta, Canada sees a 40-foot-wide object over her car, then realizes that her car is floating off the road. The UFO proceeds to float her car for a full mile.

1971: Wilton Raweater and his wife are heading to their home on the Blackfeet Reservation in Alberta, Canada. A light appears overhead and Mrs. Raweater cries out, "The car has left the ground!" The UFO carries the car two feet above the road for a quarter mile.

1973: two couples leave a party in Hattiesburg, MS when a UFO swoops down and proceeds to lift their car upward and drop it down on the road over and over again.

1974: two brothers driving a Uhaul truck north of Ely, NV encounter multiple UFOs, one of which comes right above their vehicle and carries it upward.

1974: A farmer in Hobbs, NM arrives home just in time for his family to witness him being carried upwards, pickup and all, into a flying saucer.

1978: Clora Winscher is driving through Union, MO when a UFO comes down and lifts up the back end of her car, forcing her to drive only on the front two wheels!

1978: Carlos Acevedo and Miguel Moya of Buenos Aires, Argentina drop out of an auto race, only to have a UFO come down and carry their car six feet above the road for several miles.

1983: Catherine Burk of Altoona, PA encounters a silver saucer which lifts her car up on its two left wheels.

1986: An anonymous couple in Lucca, Italy drive under a triangular-shaped object which lifts up only the back end of their car.

1988: The Knowles family are driving late at night along the Nullarbor Plain in Australia when an egg-shaped object lands on their roof and pulls their car a few meters off the road.

1992: A couple is driving through Topanga Canyon, CA when a saucer-shaped object comes fifty feet over their car and levitates it into the sky.

1994: "Alan" from Rio Grande County in CO is with his friend mentally calling a UFO when it lifts their pick-up truck off the ground and throws it across the road.

1995: an anonymous gentleman from Rio Grande, CO has a close encounter with an object which levitates his big rig truck and trailer right off the highway.

1999: a resident of Elko, NV exits his truck on the highway to observe a UFO. Seeing that it's heading toward him, he hops back into his truck to flee, only to realize that his truck is now floating six feet in the air.

2010: Two young teenagers park at the local lover's lane in Laconia, NH when a UFO comes and pulls their car vertically into the sky.

As can be seen, there is no shortage of UFO car-lift cases. All over the world, ETs are chasing cars down the highway and pulling them up into the sky. Some of these cases result in missing time or an onboard experience. But many seem to be more of a display, or a way for the ETs to announce their presence in an absolutely undeniable way.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I have a very special episode for you today I call it UFO car lift cases 
as you may know UFOs have a penchant for chasing cars down the highway there are hundreds of cases 
of this kind people report seeing a UFO and the next thing they know it's swooping down 
and chasing them down the road sometimes for miles so this can be quite a awe-inspiring 
event that the cases I want to present to you today bring this to a whole new level 
these involve cases of UFOs not only chasing cars but actually lifting them up off the road 
and this can be a couple of feet to a couple of meters in height 
and these cases actually reach back like 50 60 years and are continuing to the present 
day they take place all over the world this is absolutely a global phenomena 
and I'm not exactly sure what the motive is behind this which is why I want to present these cases to 
you so you can make up your mind firsthand what's going on here this is a very unusual type of UFO 
Behavior there aren't a lot of cases but I have over 20 that I'd like to present to you today 
which I hope will bring some answers as to why exactly these cases are taking place so let's just 
get started the first case I'd like to talk about took place in the fall of 1959 in the city of 
Goldfield this is just south of tanapa Nevada it involves three Witnesses friends all teenagers who 
had left their homes in Hollywood California just to get away and take a vacation and they ended up 
in Goldfield this is again in Nevada and one of the witnesses I call Bradley that's not his real 
name he was 14 years old it also brought along his girlfriend and there was one other Witness 
Bradley reported his case to I believe it was new Fork the National UFO Reporting Center 
and he writes that they had pulled off the highway when their pickup truck became stuck in the sand 
and their attempts to extricate themselves only ended up burying the truck more deeply until it 
was buried all the way up to its hubcaps so they spent the next few hours trying to dig 
themselves out but were not successful and they decided that one of them would have to walk out in the morning and they resigned themselves to spending the night in the desert 
so they all sat in the truck stargazing and talking when the conversation eventually turned 
to flying saucers and Bradley's girlfriend actually said let's see if we can contact a 
saucer to help us so they were only half serious and certainly weren't expecting anything to happen 
but they reached out mentally and quote started trying to telepathically contact a saucer 
and I'll just let Bradley describe what happened next as he says not long afterwards we all saw 
a light approaching I don't know the direction it came from it just looked like a bright star except 
it was moving towards us it got much brighter as it drew overhead at that moment we felt the truck 
move it Rose straight up in the air about a foot or two off the ground floated to the middle of 
the road and gently set down then the light moved back in the direction it came from and blinked out 
at the time Bradley remembers that they all screamed in fear and left the area however 
40 years later he was able to contact his former girlfriend and she actually confirmed the incident 
as Bradley says and I quote the first thing she said was what do you remember about that night 
we agreed on all the details except I remembered screaming and she remembered laughing 
so this case may sound unusual but as we will see it is far from unique and remember these Witnesses 
insisted upon remaining anonymous and they did not report the setting until many many years later 
so they really had nothing to gain from it and I'm sure they didn't know that there are many other cases like it and the next case I'd like to talk about actually took place in Venezuela 
this was along the trans-andian highway in La Victoria outside of Merida Venezuela 
and this was a particularly scary incident for the witness this was two years after the prior 
case in 1961 and the main witness is Mr Adolfo pollini Pisano he's a government topographer 
and he was driving his Jeep alone on the highway outside of La Victoria he had just slowed down 
and allowed another truck to pass him at this point a metallic disc with a polished blue color 
swooped down from the sky sweeping only a few feet above the hood of the truck ahead of him and then 
took off upwards and as this object sped away a huge cloud of dust was lifted from the ground 
and the truck ahead of Adolfo Pisano actually rose up a few feet into the air and was pulled in the 
direction of the disc for just a few seconds and then crashed down overturning onto a sand 
Bank on the right side of the road the driver of the truck crawled out of his overturned vehicle 
he escaped with only a few scratches and cuts but was in a state of nervous shock this incident was 
actually reported to the Venezuelan National Guard who kept the incident confidential 
and Adolfo Pisano actually remains silent at first but later felt that the case was important and 
decided he decided to report it to UFO researchers otherwise this case would have remained unknown so 
at this point more and more people started to report these car lift cases and the next case 
I found occurred in September 1965 in Brussels Belgium so again all over the world it was in 
September 1965 when miss a v of Brussels Belgium was driving home on a small Road this is something 
she traveled daily for work she was going just under 60 miles per hour around a curve when 
the steering wheel suddenly seemed to malfunction turning from left to right for no apparent reason 
she thought she had a flat tire and tried to slow down but at this point the car actually Rose she 
said several inches off the ground and at the same time she saw a small glowing light only a 
few inches from the right side of her windshield This Little Light moved quickly to the center 
where it remained this was a little yellow light she said it was tube shaped in about 27 inches 
long and one or two inches in diameter at this point the steering wheel stopped wobbling and 
Miss AV said she had no control over her vehicle and instead it seemed to float on a cushion of air 
she said it flew through the air for about 150 feet at this point the light disappeared and the 
car would set back on the road she immediately regained control and drove straight home 
she was pretty shook up too upset to even tell her husband what happened until about three days later but hours after the incident she noticed peculiar markings on the top side of her wrist 
where she had been most closely exposed to this strange yellow light these marks she 
said look like tiny pin Pricks they were red blue and black in color sharply outlined and 
etched much in the manner of a first degree burn but they disappeared in one week she noticed no 
other effects and actually completely forgot about this incident it totally left her mind 
it was about a year later when she saw a glowing light next to her bed and it immediately reminded 
her of this incident and uh this is when she recalled the entire car lift ordeal and she 
ended up calling UFO researchers Emil teshur and Jean-Luc vertongan who researched her case 
but they were not able to explain why her car was lifted up off the road 
it's a very unusual case and yet another example of these bizarre car lift cases 
here's another case which generated quite a bit of Interest among UFO researchers 
this occurred on December 20 1965 in Hermann Minnesota this involved a 15 year old Witness 
by the name of Edward Bruns in some accounts it's they believe his name is Edward Burns so 
there's some conflict about what his last name is at any rate it was just before midnight and Edward 
was only two miles from his home when he saw a bright light ahead of him on the road he said 
it hovered about six feet above the highway and was big it covered the entire width of the road 
he was driving a pickup heading west and as he got close to this object his car engine failed 
and the headlights went out so this is something we do see in many cases where people approach a 
UFO in their car and Edward said at this point the object glowed red and he saw Sparks coming 
out from underneath it and inside of this object he saw what appeared to be a human-like figure 
so as he approached or as he got close to it and his car engine failed this object began to 
rise up and to Edward's amazement his pickup truck promptly floated up off the road Rising along with 
the Flying Saucer he said the interior of his car was filled with a red light and the next thing he 
knew his car had been turned around 180 degrees and was now facing north lodged into a ditch on 
the opposite side of the road he was quite frightened the saucer was no longer in sight 
he fled his vehicle and ran the remaining two miles home he immediately told his father what 
happened and they returned together to the scene and examined the area with flashlights 
and Edward's father was amazed to see that there were no tire tracks surrounding the 
truck it looked as though it had been deposited there from above exactly as his son described 
and they returned the next morning to examine the area again and sure enough there were no 
tire tracks so this was good evidence that it had happened exactly as Edward had described 
a very bizarre car lift case and they continue year after year December 8 1967 Madison Indiana 
this case was investigated by themed researcher Don Worley he's a true Pioneer in this field and 
a really I think well-respected investigator and the main witness is Martha Carnes 
she's a 56 year old nursing home worker at the time of her encounter and it was just 
after midnight and she was driving down Chicken Run Road this is near her home in Madison when 
suddenly a strange orange glowing bowl-shaped object appeared following her car from above 
now this was not the first time this had happened to Martha twice earlier in November of that year 
this same craft or what appeared to be the same craft had followed her car for several 
miles and now here was again but this time it was different it came down right over her car 
and suddenly grabbed it pulling it into the air Martha said she could hear a loud humming sound 
she says a strange odor filled the air and she felt a sort of stinging sensation on her skin 
she was unable to move her body she was temporarily paralyzed to the point where she said she could not even turn her head she says it felt as though the car was being sucked 
up into a tunnel she couldn't feel the road at all um it occurred to her she might be having 
a seizure but then suddenly she felt the car tires hit the road and her car rolled to a stop 
she sat there stunned composing herself and as she examined herself she realized her head neck and 
spine were painful and swollen she was having hot flashes bright spots of light swam before her eyes 
and her bra she said was now too tight she was quite dazed and disoriented but drove home 
and when she arrived home she saw that of her 1967 Buick which mind you was less than a year old now 
had a Sheen of solid rust on it and it wasn't long before more damage became apparent all 
the car windows now leaked the water hose burst and both the battery and the radio quit working 
so Martha feels that this was more than a simple sighting or a car lift she believed she was taken on board and she later would have further encounters 
so this does seem to be a good example in which a car lift is involving an actual onboard UFO 
encounter and year after year more cases all over the world here's another very interesting case 
which occurred on February 18 1969. and this is in Alberta Canada in a little town called craigmile 
this is quite a small town and the main witness is a school teacher by the name of Barbara Smythe 
she was driving to school actually when she saw a glowing red object with two white lights she 
said it was quite large about 40 feet in diameter and this object which had been hovering when she 
first saw it began to move and immediately her car began floating she says the car seemed to levitate 
for about three minutes or one full mile and during this time she felt like she was entranced 
and at this point the object disappeared and she found herself driving along the road normally 
so yeah another very interesting car lift case and it was just two years later 
when there was another incident this was also in Canada and this occurred on May 24 1971 in 
Alberta to a blackfeet Native American couple uh the husband's name was Wilton raw eater 
he and his wife were driving along a bumpy unpaved road through their reservation and without warning 
their car was struck on the right side by a bright beam of light coming from above and as it was 
Wilton's wife Who Cried Out the car has left the ground and for the next quarter mile the car flew 
about two feet above the road at about 43 miles per hour they estimate and it was during this time 
that they were unable to control their vehicle the car was set back down the cut the light 
disappeared at the same time and the couple who were quite frightened continued their journey home 
they did talk to UFO researchers they reported no physical effects to themselves or to their car 
so I don't know I don't know what's going on here why this UFO would just lift a car up carry it for 
a quarter mile and set it down but there's case after case like this here's another case November 
1973 in Hattiesburg Mississippi and I will just quote the witness here as she says and I quote 
my husband at the time and I left a party of athletes and their girlfriends or wives 
they were drinking and the party got too wild for us another couple asked if they 
could ride home with us the couple said they didn't like the wild party either 
none of us four were drinking or smoking pot as the others were we left in our car 
my husband was driving and I was in the front seat and the other couple in the back seat 
we were driving toward home on a four-lane highway when all of a sudden the car started being pulled 
up and dropped over and over again I thought my husband might be fooling around and I told 
him to stop doing that and he took his hand off the wheel and said the car is cut off it's dead 
and that is when I noted that the car was not on there was a white light over us with no 
noise and it was large hovering and casting a large light over us and on the highway 
we were scared yelling and holding on to each other the car lifted up and dropped over and over 
I was terrified as was everyone else I don't remember much of anything after that although 
I think I should remember more I'll remember after that was the car started up and the light lifted 
up and over us and disappeared without a sound it appeared to be a saucer shape just lit up 
white and it was three months or so pregnant at the time with my now 40 year old daughter 
so this is a very bizarre case I think it might be significant that she was pregnant at the time 
ETS do seem to be drawn towards studying reproduction the fact that she feels 
like she might have some memory problems with this also makes me think it might be 
an onboard experience hard to say for sure but it certainly is strange that the car was lifted 
up and set down over and over again I don't know why that would happen a very strange 
case and now one year later February 14 1974. another case occurred outside of Eli Nevada 
and this case was very well investigated UFO researchers were very much excited about this 
case it got a lot of Investigation and it involved two brothers both businessmen who had rented a 
U-Haul truck to move their parents furniture from Idaho to California it was around 4 15 
a.m and they were driving on Highway 93 about 55 miles north of Eli Nevada or Ellie Nevada 
suddenly the first brother who I called Chuck he was driving and he observed four luminous 
for luminous bluish green objects flying in a row at a low elevation to the right one of these 
objects was flickering on and off and he turned to his brother who I called Dave who was asleep 
in the front passenger seat and said wake up and told him that they were being followed by a UFO 
Dave did not believe him didn't open his eyes and said you're crazy I want to sleep so Chuck kept 
his silence for a few minutes continued driving while this while these strange objects Pace their 
vehicle but after a few minutes one of them zoomed forward about a mile ahead across the road from 
right to left and hovered at an altitude of only 10 feet as if waiting for the truck to catch up 
so seeing this Chuck again shook his brother and said hurry up wake up fast get up I want you to 
see what's going on here what is this so Dave woke up looked outside and was shocked to see 
these objects and as these brothers approached the hovering light on the left it suddenly 
transformed into a bright orange luminous ball and I'll just quote Dave directly here as he says 
at that moment it felt like we had been hit by a blast of wind or force field 
it felt to me like a blast of wind hit the back of the truck and it felt like it just picked it up 
and we were like floating I was sitting there in the right hand seat watching him and he just kept 
going like this with the truck and he couldn't steer it he didn't have control of the truck 
Chuck said that he was struggling at this point to regain control of the vehicle as he says and 
I quote the only thing I can compare it with is if you take a curve or something on Ice 
how the truck sways from one side to the other this is how it felt to me but at the same time 
the lights were flickering off and on the motor was missing and I was losing power 
I kept my foot on the gas and I was losing power now I want to tell you that what it felt like to 
me was that I was actually floating it the truck was floating slightly off the highway in the air 
none of the wheels were touching the highway the and Dave confirms his brother's testimony 
as he says the lights on the truck flickered on and off and the engine started to miss he 
lost control of the truck and couldn't steer it I told him to stop and then before we could stop the transmission selector jumped out of drive into neutral and we coasted to a stop 
at this point the main UFO had disappeared they got out inspected the undercarriage of the truck 
they were shocked to see that the drive shaft was still spinning even though the truck was 
in neutral and not moving at this point both brothers saw a large silver colored object 
shaped like a ball with a dome on top they said and sharp wings floating over a hill to their left 
however their attention was much more drawn towards what they saw ahead of them another 
extremely brilliantly lit object landed on the center of the road right in front of them as Chuck 
says I saw down the road in front of us a light that covered the whole Road just a big big bright 
luminous light was something that was enormous in size so he turned to his brother and said 
what in the hell is that and his brother shook his head and said uh oh they're playing games with us 
and Chuck had the strong impression that they were quote coming to get us 
so they became quite frightened they could see other objects around them 
Dave jumped out of the car and blinked a flashlight at the slowly approaching object 
which responded by moving towards their truck so his brother screamed get back in the truck 
and Dave jumped in the truck and watched as this object approached as he says 
we felt that we were in a vacuum of some kind and isolated from the rest of the world 
you felt like you were trapped in other words couldn't go back couldn't go forward the truck 
wouldn't move and you were just sitting there waiting for something to change so this Face-Off 
lasted for several minutes and before the object approached any further it suddenly disappeared 
as Chuck says it just seemed as though I don't know it disappeared something came by us real fast 
so neither of them could describe exactly how this object left just that it disappeared very quickly 
they were very much relieved they said this whole encounter lasted about 20 minutes which is a long 
time for a UFO encounter and afterward their U-Haul truck was completely disabled they were 
forced to flag down another driver who took them into town and the brothers contacted 
the local U-Haul station owner who replaced the truck and then returned to the scene to 
retrieve the stranded U-Haul truck and he had heard the brother's story and was amazed to 
find how badly damaged this truck was as he says he was interviewed by UFO researchers 
as the U-Haul truck owner says the back axle was twisted right off he said that the drive 
shaft had been welded into the rear end and when they tried to haul the truck away on a tow truck 
the rear wheels just fell right off as he says those men stopped that truck just in time 
overall the truck ended up needing new tires a new rear axle new outside housing and gears all 
of which was verified by UFO researchers so both brothers said that they were somewhat traumatized 
by the incident as Dave says it took about 30 days for it to sink in my mind that I really saw it 
so this is not the only case where vehicles have been actually injured as a result of 
these encounters here's another case which occurred in September 1974 this was in Hobbs 
New Mexico I did cover this before in a previous episode so I'll just mention it briefly here 
this involves an anonymous farmer who is driving his pickup and had just approached 
his home in Hobbs New Mexico when without warning a huge quote disc shaped object 
descended over the fields about 500 feet over his barn and almost directly above him 
he was amazed and leaned out of the window of his pickup truck and looked up at this object 
and watching this were the farmer's wife daughter and a neighbor Leonard Stringfield 
reports on this case it was he who first revealed it and its Leonard Stringfield writes and I quote 
suddenly Before Their Eyes the pickup truck with the farmer in it was lifted vertically from the 
ground and vanished into the underbelly of the disc Ally the farmer's wife called the police 
now unfortunately or for whatever reason this farmer was never seen again 
and although strinkfield writes that there's this is a fantastic case it comes from a very 
reliable source as Leonard Stringfield says the facts of this case still incomplete are in 
the confidential files of the international UFO registry the investigator in this case a radio 
newsman prefers anonymity through a good source he got the basic information about the incident 
from an officer only on the basis that the names and most of the data be kept confidential until 
the victim was found dead or alive so I don't know that's a very strange case and sort of 
an outlier among these cases which are themselves outliers but it's definitely another car lift case 
so that's why I included it in this episode so moving along in time we now move to July 26 1978 
and this case occurred in the Town of Union in Missouri it was around 8 P.M when Jeannie 
Carter and two friends were driving along Highway 50. just outside of Union when they saw quote a 
big orange ball very bright in color in the sky it was bigger than the moon but much lower and 
Flames appeared to be coming off the left side of the ball so there was a lot of witnesses that 
same evening around 10 pm Ruth stiferman and her two children so it appears to be the same object 
moving at Treetop level outside their home in Union they also called the police one hour later 
two other Witnesses in the same town saw what they described as bright lit Ferris wheels hanging in 
a sideways position over Highway 50. gray in color but with bright colored lights ringing the outside 
they also called the police and 15 minutes later a lady by the name of Velma Kleins whose house 
actually overlooks Highway 50 looked outside and saw what she described as an orange Red 
Ball moving at Treetop level towards her house but it then veered South towards Highway 50. 
and it was around this time that the main witness clora wincher was driving east along 
Highway 50 on her way home to Arnold she had just visited her brother in Beaufort 
she was driving through downtown Union when she says a giant object appeared ahead of her on the 
highway and her first thought was that it was a semi-tractor trailer about to hit her and she 
prays for impact when suddenly this object flashed out a brilliant light over her car 
said the light was so bright it was blinding and she used her left hand to protect her vision from 
this beam of light and this is when the car left incident began and it didn't lift the 
whole car up it just lifted up the back side and left the own left only the two front wheels in 
contact with the ground so it's lifting up the back of the car like a 45 degree angle 
and clora said that she was actually thrown forward and looking through the windshield all 
she could see was the illuminated pavement of the road at this point her car began to heat up she 
says the windows became fogged and her car which was a 1974 Mercury Comet was still moving but 
shaking violently and vibrating and swaying from side to side Clara did her best to control the car 
she was able to steer and it appears as though the gas pedal was working but the back wheels 
were off the pain pavement so she couldn't get any traction and she just steered as best as she could 
as this object pushed her car along the highway on its front wheels towards the upcoming Bridge 
after a few minutes the light winked out and the car was set back on the road 
she pulled off the road to examine her car and she expected to find severe damage but instead 
found only two small indentations on the trunks lid but she was shocked to see that her wedding 
ring which she had been wearing was now sitting on the front passenger seat she had no idea how 
it got there because normally it was on her finger and it was very difficult to remove 
she was somewhat disoriented she drove home and told her husband and then filed a report 
with the police and following this she did notice a few symptoms her body ached she 
had recurring headaches the dental fillings on the right side of her mouth were loose 
and her finger fingernails on her left hand were also loose and painful and it was one week after 
the incident that she did find a spot of blood on her pillow coming from her nose she believes so 
began she did have some health problems she lost a little bit of hair on the right side of her head 
so it does appear that this was more than a simple car lift and that she was in fact taken on board 
considering that her wedding ring was removed so she appears to have been a contactee and they were 
basically coming to pick her up hard to say for sure but it's certainly a dramatic example of a 
car lift case the next case I'd like to talk about is super dramatic one of the really typical sort 
of car lift cases this occurred on September 25 1978 outside of Buenos Aires Argentina 
the two witnesses were Carlos Acevedo he's a 38 year old businessman who decided to enter a 
cross-country endurance car race and it was a 600 mile long race and along with Carlos 
Acevedo was his mechanic the mechanic's name is Miguel Angel Moya and he was 28 years old 
however unfortunately their car broke down and they had to withdraw from the competition they 
got the car repaired and began the drive back to Buenos Aires I was at this point somewhere 
along the trip when a bright yellow light approached their car from behind and above 
it moved quickly shown a bright beam of light on the car Illuminating the interior and dazzling 
the witnesses Carlos Acevedo who is driving said he lost control of the car and looking 
out the window they could both see that they were now floating about six feet above the road 
they were disoriented and became confused about how much time was passing 
but the car flew through the air for quite some time finally they felt a bump and found 
that they were back on the road many miles from where they had been pulled into the air 
the gas tank was now nearly empty and they were unable to account for at least one hour of time 
they rushed to the nearest police station in Pedro luro and reported what happened 
and this case created quite a sensation it was published in newspapers they did several 
television interviews it's a very famous case in Argentina and a really dramatic car lift case 
so there you can see this is a worldwide phenomena in the next case I'd like to talk about I don't have a whole lot of information about other than it occurred in 1979 in the 
California desert right along the Nevada border this actually comes from researcher David Jacobs 
and he says that the main witness Tracy Knapp I believe that's a pseudonym she's a musician had 
just turned 21 years old and to celebrate she and her girlfriends decided to drive from LA 
to Las Vegas and it was late at night when they saw a strange light swoop down over their car 
it's not clear whether they had missing time or not however under hypnosis a more complete 
scenario emerged Tracy reported that her car was actually lifted up and taken inside the UFO 
as she says under hypnotic regression and I quote the car is spinning around like I'm in a teacup 
like I'm spinning like the car is turning and I'm grabbing onto the seat and we're screaming we're 
not on the ground it's like we're being spun up like we're moving forward and getting spun 
and I'm holding onto the car I feel a force a pressure heavy like I'm weak and weighted 
I can't talk nothing's being said at that point my friends they're going limp they open the door and 
I feel like I'm being picked up out of there so Jacobs doesn't reveal all the details about this 
incident but he does say that Tracy Knapp did have further encounters one of the most unusual car 
lift cases on record occurred on October 15 1983 and this is just North of Altoona Pennsylvania 
at this time there was a wave of sightings sweeping over the area it was around 9 or 10 P.M 
when a retired receptionist by the name of Catherine Burke age 67 was driving along Route 
220 on her way home to Bellwood she was about to exit the highway when she heard something 
strange as she says it was a weird sound real fast was like a real fast hum and it was sharp 
so she looked towards the source of the sound to her right and saw a silver saucer-shaped object 
coming towards her she says it was about 24 feet in diameter and about 30 feet off the ground and 
tilted as she says it was a bright silver with a pocket underneath it was really bright really 
bright really big so this object came straight for her car passing directly overhead and that's 
when her car was lifted up as she says when it went over me it took the right side of my car up 
now this point the car was riding solely on the front and back left 
two wheels the right side of the car was about two or three feet up in the air 
Catherine tried to slide over to the passenger seat to push the car down but she said she was 
unable to do so as she says I couldn't get control of the car I was sliding all over the place 
she tried the steering wheel but seemed to have no effect she said the car headlights were blinking 
on and off she was quite frightened and was really unable to see the UFO itself because she says she 
was too busy trying to just hold on this was very brief after about only three seconds the car fell 
back down on the road as she says it came down with such a thud and in fact the force was so 
great she was almost forced under the dashboard this point the car engine was now stalled 
she immediately pulled off the road and stopped and watched the object disappear over a ridge 
she was still frightened so she tried to compose herself and start the car but the engine refused 
to work and it took her about 20 minutes of trying to get the car started before she finally got 
the engine to work she arrived home and vowed at first to tell nobody because she thought everyone 
would think she was crazy however her daughter called and could tell that her mom was upset and 
got the whole story from her and it was Catherine Burke's daughter who immediately called the police 
and police chief Gregory ciaccio interviewed Catherine and said that she was quote visibly 
shaking and only then did she discover that she actually had been injured should partial 
hearing loss in her right ear a severe headache and soreness in her shoulder chest and spine 
so she was eventually referred to mufon field investigator T Scott crane Jr 
and other investigators they were unable to locate any other witnesses to this Eve event 
and at the time Catherine Burke didn't even believe in UFOs and she thought that it might have been a secret government project 
as she says and I quote I always said the government was trying out stuff but I never 
want to see nothing like that again it's just the idea that it was something I never saw before 
I never was afraid to be by myself and I wouldn't have been scared if it hadn't raised the car up 
but it did this is another unusual case in that it only lifted up half the car 
it's really quite strange here's another very brief case this occurred on October 28 1986 and 
a couple was driving in Italy near the town of via Reggio in Lucca and they saw a very large 
dark triangular shaped object with four Bright Lights hovering over the harbor and as they drove 
underneath this object they heard a loud boom and their car Shook and they said it quote went mad 
they said the engine revved up the car slowed down and the back of their car was lifted upward 
and then dropped back down again this point the object moved off towards the mountains 
they reported their setting to the Italian police and learned that several other callers had also 
reported the strange object but apparently they're the only ones who reported their car being lifted 
or I should say half their car just the rear end and following this incident the couple said that 
they both experienced headaches which persisted for a few days and then went away perhaps the most 
dramatic and well-known of all car lift cases on record occurred to the Knowles family of Australia 
was around 4 a.m on January 20 1988 when Faye Knowles and her three sons Patrick age 24 
Sean age 21 and Wayne age 18 and their two dogs were traveling across the remote nullar 
bore plain between Madura and Mundra Billa Sean was driving and he was the first to notice the 
strange light ahead of them and he thought it was a truck except for it was just one bright light and it appeared to be just above the road ahead of him so he shouted out to his 
family look that's something unusual is that a spaceship and his brother Patrick said nah 
don't be stupid uh Patrick thought it was just a truck but as they got closer to This Light it 
revealed itself to be a large egg-shaped object and it was obstructing most of the road it was 
glowing bright yellow orange and was blocking their passage as Faye says it was in the middle 
of the road just in the middle of the road so Sean who was driving was amazed and swerved the 
car to try to pass it he narrowly missed another car traveling in the opposite direction and at 
this point the strange object moved to the right side of the road and began to chase the other car 
as Sean says it was moving backward and forward so we decided to take off to have a look 
it was flying miles back and we drove miles up the road and it was in front of us again 
so this turned out to have major consequences because the object began to come towards them and 
went behind them again and started to Circle their car and as they drove along they realized it was 
chasing them so Sean stepped on the accelerator reaching soon speeds of over 100 miles per hour 
he says it was the fastest he had ever driven in his entire life all of them saw it the entire 
Knowles family as fennel says we actually saw it it was chasing us as her son Sean who was driving 
said it was a fair distance back in the next second it was on the roof as soon as it landed on 
the car that's when my tire blew out smoke started coming into the car and that's when I blanked out 
so the rest of them who are still conscious heard a loud clunking noise and allowed 
buzzing noise and the car began shaking as Patrick says it was a loud humming sound 
the mother Faye says it was terrible it was terrifying so she looked out the window and 
saw this huge huge egg-shaped object which was actually landed on the roof of their car 
and she screamed at her sons there's something on the roof it's on the top of the roof and 
she rolled down her window and seeing the subject reached out to actually touch it and she said out 
loud my God what is it and in a later interview she says she described this she said I rolled 
down the window and I felt this thing on the roof I said there's something on top of our roof it's 
landed on our roof I don't know what to do and Patrick said come off it you've got to be joking 
so he was disbelieving and he just he decided to investigate himself as he says and again I quote I 
opened up my window and the car started going out of control and all this smoke it was like smoke 
all started coming into the car and my brain started to go crazy I thought it was going 
in my head I thought my brain was getting sucked out Faye was still trying to figure out what this 
object was by actually touching it and as she says it was like a sponge on the roof stuck to the roof 
of the car a sponge we were screaming and yelling and this is one something really strange happened 
they said that they felt like they were moving in slow motion that his voice got really deep 
and his voice changed as he says they were really deep and slow it was so deep it's really 
hard to explain we felt like we were dying I was really scared scared as I've ever been 
it just felt like we were dying Faye was also terrified and she agrees with her son and she 
says we thought we were dying we didn't know what to do I was screaming I was in hysterics 
Wayne felt the car shaking and he saw the car was now actually being drawn up into the air at 
least a few meters they said as Wayne says it was pretty scary it started shaking it started 
lifting the car up it started lifting it we don't really know but we think the car was 
lifted off the road Faye said we were in a State of Shock we didn't know what was going on all of 
a sudden this thing's on our roof and pulling the car up and we don't know what's going on 
so this object remained fastened to the car roof for a period they estimated at least five minutes 
at which point it set them back on the road at this point Sean who was driving woke back 
up he slammed on the brakes they skidded to a stop the objects took off and remained in 
view just a short distance away the four of them and their two dogs hopped out of the car and hid 
behind a small tree on the side of the road and waited there for 10 or 15 minutes before they 
could gather enough courage to return to their vehicle they saw that their tire was blown and uh 
Sean changed the tire and two minutes flat he said they were so frightened they didn't even 
bother to retrieve the Jack before they piled back into the car and took off and during all 
this time this object was still hovering ahead of them on the road and as soon as they started 
moving the objects started following them again as Patrick says started to follow us and as 
Faye says it was strange it was following us everywhere it wouldn't leave us alone 
so finally they continue driving and the object followed them until daylight arrived 
at which point it finally Departed they called the police in case someone else 
had seen this object because they knew there were other Witnesses they'd seen another car 
the police were skeptical at first but saw that the entire family was emotionally traumatized and 
was shortly later several other Witnesses were located and they corroborated the null's story 
and the police also saw that the strip there was strange black soot on the car strange indentations 
on the roof they could see the damage to the tire so despite all this physical evidence and 
additional Witnesses this story did leak out and the Press ridiculed the nulls mercilessly 
all kinds of theories were raised to explain their story some said it was a secret military 
test others said it was ball lightning others accused the nose of hoaxing the event or mass 
hysteria something which they all vehemently denied there was no evidence of a hoax ever found 
nor did the various theories raised by Skeptics account for the evidence and after suffering the 
trauma from the event itself and the instilling ridicule the Knowles family ultimately regretted 
going public with their story but it's certainly one of the most amazing car lift cases on record 
another case occurred on June 14 1992 in the small community of Topanga Canyon on this evening 
the entire area experienced an incredible wave of sightings involving literally hundreds of objects 
Witnesses from all over Topanga Canyon and the surrounding area observed objects hovering turning 
at right angles racing across the sky hovering over people's homes and chasing Vehicles down 
the highway several of these Witnesses called the police others called the local newspaper station 
and uh some of the people who called the police one couple told a really incredible story uh which 
involves their car being lifted up into the sky as he told the police and I quote because this 
is directly from a leaked police tape they said we are very shaken up and somewhat disoriented we are 
almost ashamed to tell you what we saw you'll think I'm crazy but I don't know who to tell 
the caller assured the officer that he didn't drink or take drugs as he said and I quote officer 
we were driving through the canyon where the canyon gets deep and we noticed a bright light in 
the sky and we had a very uneasy feeling because it was moving and we both felt it was following us 
all of a sudden on top of us was this extremely bright object we could hear it wasn't a helicopter 
it had a high-pitched sound and we lost control of the car and it lifted us up into the sky 
it lifted us up off the ground now I'm telling you I've never been more frightened in my life 
the caller was near T tears and the deputy did his best to reassure the frightened Witnesses 
and the caller concluded his report saying we were put down we lost our memory for I don't 
know how long maybe a couple of minutes and it wasn't there anymore I don't believe in these 
things I'm telling you I'm a normal human being I have a job a good job my girlfriend has a good 
job she's a nurse we are very disoriented we got home by the grace of God my girlfriend was near 
hysterical I don't know what to do we are very nauseous and we feel very weak and disoriented 
so the officer recommended seeking medical help and gently terminated the call 
now I did play this police tape on a previous YouTube episode of mine called night of the UFOs 
so if you'd like to hear that actual tape you can listen to it but what I would like to do is play a brief excerpt and you can hear this witness tell his story in his own words

UFO Reporting Center calling from Los Angeles yes I've got to make this fairly short because I'm gonna get back to my doctors at 2 30. um 
the FAA and the Air Force gave me this number yes and I'd like to report something that happened 
to my girlfriend and I last night katanga Canyon okay would you describe it please and by the way we called the Malibu police and they said that three other people had reported 
similar things this is nothing but imagining okay um we were driving up Coast Highway number 
one Pacific Coast Highway are you familiar with that area yes I am and we've backtracked and went 
decided to go up to panga Canyon Road which is a it goes pretty high up into the Canyon Country 
do you know where Japan Canyon is yes okay very familiar with it all right um there's a 
place where old Topanga Canyon goes to New Topanga Canyons there's a real high ledge that 
goes deep deep down you can Overlook the canyon okay at any rate okay it's weird as it goes on 
out of nowhere appeared over our car a brilliant brilliant brilliant light 
that was hovering about I'd say 50 feet on top of our car okay
and uh at first we thought it was a helicopter a police helicopter or something except that we realized that we didn't hear any sound 
and we looked up and we could see clearly the defined shape of a
a pie shaped object a saucerer I mean I hate to use that term saucer type object 
there was a rim we could see a rim and then within the rim was this just one big brilliant brilliant light that kept shining on our car 
okay was this like a beam of light yes okay was that in the form of a beam or a cone
um it was a wide cone okay a wide cone covered oh I'd say a good 
maybe 50 feet in diameter okay but it was very very bright at any rate we turned the car around 
and we decided to go back down the canyon and this damn thing kept following us it kept 
at the speed we were going at the same speed we were going it was following us it was it was above our car about 50 feet I say and we kept looking up and it kept it was there and if we would 
go faster it would go faster if we would slow down it would slow down and we had the distinct 
impression that was pursuing us and the only noise I could I felt that we could hear was uh
the sound that a Transformer would make like a hum all right a high-pitched thumb okay 
then I told my girlfriend we better get out of here so I accelerated the car 
but you got to be very careful with the panga Canyon because it's a very windy 
uh it's a very windy road and when I tried to accelerate the car 
my engine went off the lights went off everything went out okay and we got out of the car thinking 
that we were going to run away I'm telling you my girlfriend was almost to the state of Hysteria in 
fact later on I we went to Cedar Sinai emergency room when I got home when we got to our home here 
um when we got out of the car we got even a better look at it we saw that it was not a helicopter 
and within I'd say seconds it just went straight up in the air 
and as quickly as it appeared that's how quickly Advantage okay 
but anyway we got back into the car and uh the car started and we got down to the 
coast Highway we came home to Los Angeles and my girlfriend was she's a nurse I'm an accountant 
uh we went uh to sign the emergency room and we had broken out on in blisters 
on the backs of our hands my girlfriend where she was wearing a necklace you could see the more 
the more the necklace was I wear glasses you can see on my face in a glass the glass mark 
and we have a very nauseous a night and diarrhea
is that like a band abandonment yes
yes it's like a bad sunburn but it's weepy they're weeping blisters okay 
and I sure didn't have it we didn't have this when we went out that we 
at any rate we did call the Malibu police when we got home and uh they said the three other people had called concerning uh similar incidents that evening yeah
there was an officer Burns that I had spoken with and we're going to go back to the doctors today at 2 30 so I can't 
stay too long and I don't want to get terribly involved with the even the doctor said I should I I could report this I don't I'm not prone to
these far out situations sir but it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life it really quick question that was your girlfriend at RN yes now what 
time did that occur it occurred I would say approximately at 12 30.
yes my girlfriend works at the Wadsworth Veterans Hospital okay
what was the name of that Veterans Hospital do you have any estimate of the diameter of the object it was about feet diameter okay
now do you remember the color that cone of light
um white okay white with uh um but there was some blue and a blue around the edges
okay now when you were exposed to that uh beam of light did you detect any change of temperature
you know but our skin tingled okay and it felt like there was a little I don't know 
electrical feeling in your skin okay and then for a brief moment to tell you the 
truth neither of us even could remember what happened it was almost as if we had blacked out
that you feel that that was a very short duration I think so I have no way of knowing okay
did you detect any unusual odors time
come to think of it yeah uh
say like burnt cinnamon okay did you have any trouble restarting your car
at that point I can't to tell you the truth I can't remember okay all right I think maybe
I can't remember okay have you seen any other problems with the car since you got home okay 
now were there any other unusual physical traces uh with you or your lady friend no
no and how long do you feel this entire uh incident went on
I feel that it followed us for about 10 minutes okay and then out of the car maybe a minute or so 
but when we were we were out of the cars when I kind of kind of lost track of what was going 
on okay so every people report things like this well yes sir they sure have they've been 
reporting them for years now what was the name of the doctor you're going to 
well we went to the Cedars-Sinai emergency room and I don't recall the uh doctor okay 
because of my job I really don't want to I understand because 
we talked about listen to people we are going to go see a psychiatrist I mean I don't we we weren't hallucinating I didn't make this ration yes
okay can I get your name sir I don't want to give my name okay is there any way we can get back to you if we need more information what more information would you need I'll I'll 
go back to the doctors I can't call you back it's just my wife my girlfriend has a governmental job
gotta understand this is such high strangeness that people tend if it gets out 
they tend to look at you weird or something I understand okay what would you like to do after 
you visit your doctor if you feel like it would like to hear what his diagnosis of the injuries is
what do they do with all this data what do we do with it well we compare it with other similar 
cases over the past years which gives us a basis for determining the reality of what is going on 
is this something that the government is doing no no the uh this type of incident has occurred 
uh off and on or throughout the United States and overseas for the last 40 years
read about things like this but reading it is one thing but when you stand I I don't know how to explain it I just I don't know how to explain it 
it can be very traumatic and other other people do call you oh yes we get uh we're average about six 
calls or six reports a day right now and that's very very quiet we cover all of North America
well there's of course three or four different uh theories my own personal opinion is that these 
are objects coming in from outer space and I've been studying the subject for 36 years
so as you can see that's pretty amazing first hand eyewitness testimony of a car lift and this wave 
of sightings continued for another two years until 1994 at least and many other people reported being 
chased in their cars by these objects but no one else reported being lifted up into the sky 
I just have a few more cases I'd like to share with you today uh so I mean there are dozens of cases and the next case I found occurred in 1994 in 
the Rio Grande County just north of the New Mexico border this comes from colorado-based 
researcher Christopher O'Brien who spoke directly with the witness Allen who told him 
that his he and his family have been seeing quote every kind of ship you could imagine 
these objects these UFOs Allen said were flying all over the desert area surrounding their 
home large shifts small ones triangular shaped disc shaped craft and as Alan says and I quote 
my mother found out that they would come closer if you called to them in your mind 
so this really intrigued Alan and he wanted to try to communicate with the occupants of this these 
craft so one evening in 1994 Alan and his friend went out to watch these objects darting around 
they sat in the friend's pickup truck and waited to see if anything would show up and sure enough early in the evening as Alan says and I quote a strange Bank of fog rolled in 
they saw an object and it approached about 600 feet away and as Alan says I started to call it 
closer and it approached and just sat there about 50 feet away well my friend kind of freaked out 
grabbed his rifle from the rack and popped off a couple of shots at it it went above us and 
somehow it lifted up the truck and pulled it into the far ditch so this could have been a 
reaction to the boys actually shooting at the UFO probably not a good idea and maybe that's why it 
swooped down and lifted up the car hard to say but it's a good example of a UFO car lift case 
here's another briefcase in the same general area one year later it's occurred in July of 1995. 
to an anonymous witness I'll call him Larry this was also in Rio Grande Colorado area 
uh he had just experienced a close-up sighting of a UFO over his truck and this was followed 
by a period of missing time and when he regained Consciousness he discovered a very strange mystery 
he exited his truck and found that it was now sitting quote six inches away from its tracks 
it looked as though his truck had been lifted up and set a half foot to the side and not only that 
the tops of the trees nearby had been sheared off these were 60-foot high trees So Not only 
was his truck moved but also his bulldozer and trailer were also moved the same distance
another case occurred four years later July 12 1999 and this occurred near Elko Nevada 
the anonymous witness had just finished tuning up his truck and wanted to take it on a long drive 
to make sure everything worked it was around 7 30 PM it had been driving for about an hour and 
a half and was between Elko and Carlin near the independence mountains when he noticed a 
quote huge black mass that he said was blocking up the Stars now on the bottom of this object 
there were dozens of little lights that appeared almost star-like and he felt as if the object was 
almost trying to camouflage itself he became alarmed immediately stopped his truck turned 
off the engine and got outside to observe and as he watched this craft approached him and stopped 
directly over his vehicle he became frightened and jumped into his truck turned on the ignition 
the engine roared to life and I'll just let the witness describe what happened next as he says 
the truck wasn't moving I realized that the truck was in the air about five or six feet I was going 
to jump but then the truck Came Crashing Down I sped away I was amazed and really happy that 
my truck survived the fall I drove to Carlin and spent the night there the next day I checked out 
my truck and I only broke some bushings a front brake caliper and two back brake drums so there 
you go another case involving physical damage to the vehicle which has been lifted up into the sky 
so I have just one more case I'd like to present to you today this is a really dramatic case and 
quite recent this occurred on March 20th 2010 there were two witnesses who are anonymous 
one is 16 year old David known only really is D an 18 year old I did discover her real name 
but it's clear she wants to be anonymous so I'm not going to use her real name 
at any rate they decided to take a drive in the town of Laconia New Hampshire 
they were dating and looking for a place where they could be alone and there was a little local 
parking lot near opichi Park which was Often frequented by young couples and as Dave says 
there were eight cars there already when we arrived the car started leading one by one and 
we were the last car in the parking lot was then that something very strange happened as he says 
the lights of the parking lot and the lights of the houses around us and the lights of the 
houses down the street started to go out one by one and it was then that Melissa noticed 
that there was a weird black object overhead between them and the Moon 
and she said what was that Dave observed the object in awe he saw that it wasn't a cloud 
because it was moving Against the Wind and when it moved slowly it became ball shaped but when it 
moved fast Dave said it looked like a flat plate and it was covered with dim yellow white lights 
and he told his girlfriend if it gets any closer we need to leave 
so she watched it closely and as she says it moved back across the Moon was huge and it looked like 
it was zigzagging or changing shape I couldn't tell and Dave said I think it's coming closer 
he said it appeared to be tumbling or flipping and over end and she felt a rush of fear as this 
object quickly approached them as she says it flew so fast over the trees getting closer to 
where we were it felt like it was zeroing in on us it blocked the Moon as Dave says it suddenly 
crossed the street towards our car and it was only then that he realized how big this object was he 
says it was like about 14 houses put together and uh at this point they both pretty much panicked 
Dave started the car and screeched off as he says I did not have time to turn on the headlights 
so they just wanted to get out of there and Dave was driving crazy scared Melissa she 
thought they were going to hit the building but Dave turned to the left just in time to avoid a collision and that's when it happened this is when their car suddenly left the ground 
as Melissa says and I quote it felt like we went off a jump you know that feeling 
like we were on a roller coaster and we were in the air I was trying to pay attention to 
everything that was going on but I felt like I couldn't and when I looked up everything was 
black I heard absolutely nothing it was silent I felt immobilized like I had no control over 
what I was doing I could see nothing it was like opening your eyes in a pitch black room 
Dave confirms this and as he says the front end got picked up and the car would not move 
we steered left and right but the car just kept on going up in the air 
my girlfriend was scared I was screaming the car was going up and the back wheels were off 
the ground and then I looked out the window and I saw the parking lot started getting smaller 
so Dave watched in disbelief as cracks spread across the windshield from the 
passenger side to the driver's side and the entire windshield appeared to be coming loose 
and as Dave says the whole time in my head something was telling me don't be scared it wasn't 
a language I don't know how to explain it so he's clearly describing a telepathic message here 
and he looked over and saw that his girlfriend was actually dangling outside the car window hovering about a foot and a half above the car seat 
but most amazing the car was pointing straight up and looking up Dave saw nothing but blackness 
and when he tried to look at the object itself he said something really strange happened as he says 
every time I tried looking at it in front a white film went over my eyes I could not hear Melissa 
screaming but I knew she was screaming my ears felt like they kept popping from the altitude 
so Melissa was pulled pulled out of the passenger side of the car and Dave says 
he felt something grabbing his left wrist wrist and begin to pull him out of the window 
as he says there was no pain but it was strong they both noticed a strange odor 
Dave says the smell was unbearable it was spicy like pepper spray and clean at the same time 
it was a smell that you could stand but you would close your nostrils because it still feels bad 
as Melissa says regarding this odor it was not nice it was an odor I've never smelled 
before I felt really nervous and scared but I don't remember crying or screaming 
so Melissa is trying to hold on to the center console and as she says when I 
finally realized what was happening I was so close to the windshield that my body was going 
forward with my arms behind me everything was black and I heard I'm not a noise like a horn 
and Dave also heard the horn going off so this was apparently the car horn and he said it was really 
strange because every time the car horn went off this Forest that was holding them seemed to weaken 
and they would sort of flop back down towards the car as Dave says we realized we were still 
up in the air it took two seconds for the car to drop and when we dropped the airbags came out 
so his girlfriend agrees as she says the car just dropped I hit my eye on the dashboard and the 
airbags came out I held my face and I looked over at my boyfriend and I saw that his left arm had 
blood so she turned to him and said are you okay and Dave just sat there silent and stunned they 
both could see that the windshield was cracked all the way across the passenger side this weird 
smell still filled the car Dave put the car into gear and they drove off as quickly as they can 
as quickly as they could the smell began to dissipate Melissa broke into tears and said 
what the hell just happened and Dave was weeping and cursing and said I don't know I don't know 
and they both cried as they raced to her mother's house neither felt like the object was following 
them but neither of them understood what had just happened as Dave says it seemed like we were in 
the air for 10 minutes but it felt like forever so as they pulled up to Melissa's mother's house 
she could hear her daughter freaking out Melissa said I couldn't stop crying her mother said just 
calm down and tell me what happened and she said you're never going to believe me 
and her mother said is it my car what's wrong and Melissa said well let me explain 
and she said she could feel the memory of this incident starting to leave her mind 
as she says I felt that if I didn't explain it fast enough it was just 
going to go away from my mind so she very nearly had missing time but she recalled it 
and she told the whole story and after hearing this Melissa's mother decided to call the police 
was now 15 minutes after midnight an officer arrived and took down their testimony and he 
was skeptical at first until he examined the car you saw the airbags were deployed 
the windshield was cracked the vehicle itself appeared to be otherwise undamaged 
and that he found quite puzzling because it was obvious that it would take considerable Force 
to deploy the airbags and destroy the windshield this point Dave pulled out his cell phone to make 
a call and as he opened it he says an electric Arc from the phone Zapped out and shocked his 
hand the officer said he would investigate the area where this incident happened the next morning 
and uh told the Dave that he should take a shower and get the airbag dust off of him 
or actually he told that to Melissa he told Melissa go take a shower get the 
airbag dust off of you but Melissa declined as she says I didn't want to be alone at all 
so they did have a few bumps or bruises but were otherwise unhurt and Melissa I mean she didn't 
have a scratch on her and the blood that she had seen on her boyfriend's arm was completely gone 
she did have a weird dream uh that night where she was back in elementary school and was unable 
to talk while everyone else was speaking for her she says it did not feel right at all 
it was a few days later that Dave went to his doctor and he documented a puncture wound or 
what appeared to be a puncture wound on his forearm and a semi-circular incision 
so they both felt some residual emotional trauma Dave felt very uncomfortable being 
outside at night did not like the feeling of a car driving especially when the road became bumpy and 
Melissa herself said she really did not want to go outside anymore because she says I'm scared 
so this case was thoroughly investigated by mufan field investigator and New England state 
director Steve fermani he examined the vehicle as well and he determined that after this object 
was pulled into the sky it was actually set down 180 feet away from its original location 
and an inspection of the parking lot where the incident occurred did reveal scars on the ground 
which appeared to be consistent with their vehicle being dropped down from above and they also 
discovered that the car was in fact more damaged than they had originally estimated they found out 
that the undercarriage of the car sustained an estimated five thousand dollars in damage 
so here we have another case involving solid physical evidence and that is all of the cases 
there you go that's this episode for you today I hope you've enjoyed it all of these cases I 
did present in my new book not from here volume 4. and as you can see there are enough cases where I 
think they weren't serious attention why are UFOs lifting up cars off the highway I think it's clear 
in a number of these cases people are being taken on board but I'm not sure that's true in all these 
cases it could be but it seems like in some of them you UFOs are just lifting them up in sort of 
a display showing off what they can do or perhaps trying to impress the Witnesses in some way 
I am honestly not sure but these cases sure are really interesting because this shows a 
type of UFO Behavior you don't often see I can only imagine how it must feel to be 
driving down the highway when suddenly you find your car floating off the road 
so I hope you've enjoyed this episode I really appreciate you watching thanks very much and until 
next time keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most important keep having fun
