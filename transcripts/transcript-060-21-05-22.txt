THE UFO INVASION OF EDWARD AIR FORCE BASE
May 22, 2021

Summary:
May 22, 2021
Many Air Force Bases across the United States and the world have been visited by UFOs. But there is one specific Air Force base that may be at the top of the list: Edwards Air Force base. The shocking and astounding events that have occurred at Edwards Air Force base go way beyond mere UFO sightings. In fact, virtually the entire range of the UFO phenomenon is represented. There are sightings, landings, face-to-face meetings with ETs, UFO crashes, abductions, reverse engineering of UFO technology and more! 

Events began as early as 1947 and are still continuing today. Way back in 1947, a two-days-long series of sightings put the base on high alert and changed the way the Air Force viewed and handled the UFO phenomenon. Following this, the base was visited regularly. For some reason, Edwards AFB has become a magnet for the UFO phenomenon. Few other locations on Earth have experienced the magnitude and frequency of UFO encounters.

This video presents a gripping chronological history of UFO activity at this highly technological location. You will hear about dozens of close-up sightings, the day a UFO landed on the runway and was filmed by Air Force officers, the alleged meeting with President Eisenhower and extraterrestrials, a little known UFO crash, multiple cases involving reverse-engineering of ET technology and so much more, including cases that have never been revealed before. The military has done their best to cover-up these events. But the truth can no longer remain hidden. The public deserves to know the truth. The US government has known for more than 70 years that UFOs and aliens are real. Now it's time that the world knows.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the 
paranormal I call this episode the ufo invasion of edwards air force base edwards air force base is 
neck deep involved with ufos it's not just sightings of which there are dozens but there 
are also landings taking place here face-to-face meetings with ets at least one ufo crash 
reverse engineering of ufo hardware and much much more it's quite an amazing story and 
what i'd like to do today is just take you on a little chronological journey through the amazing 
events that are occurring at edwards air force base edwards was originally called murak field 
and was established in 1933 but it was later renamed edwards air force base in honor of 
captain glenn w edwards he was a test pilot who tragically lost his life there in 1948. 
now edwards air force base is where the u.s military conducts its aviation experiments 
and development of aircraft many of our most advanced aircraft have their origins at edwards 
air force base and in fact on october 14 1947 test pilot chuck yeager broke 
the sound barrier as he flew his x1 plane over edwards because of secrecy concerns nine months 
elapsed before an official announcement was made of this amazing pioneering event 
also in 1947 the record for the highest elevation of a human being was made at edwards 
so as you can see edwards air force base is arguably one of the most technologically advanced 
places on earth therefore it should come as no surprise that it has been a powerful magnet for 
intense ufo activity edwards is located north of victorville in southern california it's on 
the southwestern section of the vast mojave desert and edwards air force base experienced its first 
recorded visitation at the dawn of the modern age of ufos and actually this was only a few days 
after the very famous roswell ufo crash in july of 1947 and it's important to note that some of the 
roswell wreckage was reportedly shipped to murak or edwards at this time so the invasion of edwards 
air force base really began on july 7th 1947 when test pilot major jc wise was preparing for 
takeoff from edwards when he saw a yellow white spherical object heading over the air force 
base as major wise says it was oscillating in a forward whirling movement without losing altitude 
and this event marked the beginning of one of the most important events in ufo history 
it was the very next day on july 8th when a series of incredible sightings took place over murak 
the sightings were of such a magnitude and involved so many reliable observers 
that it would forever change the way the air force handled ufo reports finally the 
u.s military was finally forced to take ufos seriously listed as case number 50 
unidentified in the air force's project blue book files this saga really began at 10 am am 
when the base building officer lieutenant joseph c mchenry was outside his office only minutes 
earlier lieutenant mchenry and other officers have been talking at the base's post exchange about the 
recent sighting at the base and other sightings that have been headlining in the local newspapers 
lieutenant mchenry was skeptical of the reports and joked with his fellow officers somebody 
will have to show me one of these discs before I will believe it little did he know his wish was 
about to come true as he walked out of his office he heard a plane coming in for a landing 
and he looked up and saw the plane but then he also saw something else and it wasn't a plane 
as lieutenant mchenry says looking up as I always do I observed two silver objects of either a 
spherical or disk-like shape moving about 300 miles per hour according to mchenry these objects 
looked like they were about 8 000 feet altitude heading northwest he dashed inside and called out 
three other officers as lieutenant mchenry says they immediately came to where I was standing I 
pointed in the direction of the objects and asked them the question tell me what you see up there 
whereupon all three with sundry comments stated they are flying discs these officers all carefully 
observed these objects to make sure that they weren't the result of any type of optical illusion 
and all of them concluded the objects couldn't be weather balloons as they were traveling against the prevailing wind and at this point a third object appeared as lieutenant mchenry says 
two of us at the same time cited another object of a silver spherical or disk like nature 
at approximately eighty eight thousand feet traveling in circles over the north end 
from my actual observance the object circled in too tight a circle and too severe 
to be any aircraft that I know of lieutenant mchenry and the 
other witnesses all signed affidavits attesting to the truth of their events 
as mchenry says this statement has been given freely and voluntarily without any threat or 
prompt promises under duress another one of the witnesses was major richard shupe 
and he said and I quote it appeared to be metallic because the method in which it was 
flying caused the sun to reflect like an apparent aluminum colored surface another witness was 
sergeant gerald e naumann who said and I quote I saw two objects with my own eyes 
i am positive these two objects could not have been aircraft weather balloon or birds they go 
they gave off a definite reflection from the rays of the sun I saw another object a few minutes 
later doing certain maneuvers such as flying in a tight circle i've been flying in and have been 
around all types of aircraft since 1943 and never in my life have I ever seen anything such as this 
another one of the witnesses was sergeant joseph ruvolo and he was called out by lieutenant mchenry 
as sergeant ruvolo says he called me to come outside and to my surprise I saw two flying 
objects which appeared to me like two flying discs or saucer-shaped silver colored objects 
i am of good health and sound mine and this was no hallucination another witness was lieutenant 
mchenry's secretary janet marie scott she also gave a signed affidavit uh testifying to what 
she saw as she says there were two silver colored disc-like objects one directly back 
of the other at a speed of 300 to 400 miles per hour I cited another object similar to the 
above mentioned objects this object was silver colored and in the shape of a disk flying in a 
tight circle it could not have been any type of aircraft so this was just the beginning 
uh two hours later that same day an air force test pilot observed a yellowish white sphere traveling 
against the wind over the base and two hours after that a group of technicians including a major also 
observed an object and made the following report as the major says we observed a round object 
white aluminum color which at first resembled a parachute canopy as this object descended through 
a low enough level to permit observation of its lateral silhouette it presented a distinct oval 
shaped outline with two projections on the upper surface which might have been thick fins or knobs 
these cross each other at intervals suggesting either rotation or oscillation of slow type 
no smoke flames propeller arcs engine noise or other plausible or visible means of propulsion 
were noted so this sighting was also witnessed by yet another observer captain john paul strap 
at nearby rogers lake who said at one point the object came down and may have actually landed on 
the ground as he says the object appeared to be the size of a pursuit airplane but did not have 
the shape of a conventional plane events were still in progress this was a very very busy day 
at miroc field a few hours later at 3 50 pm another pilot flying at twenty thousand 
feet a mere forty miles south of murak observed quote a flat object of a light reflecting nature 
he attempted to pursue this object more than once but it easily evaded him so this rash of sightings 
at murak put the base on high alert and the technical intelligence division of the 
air material command was immediately informed and we now know that intelligence reports 
indicated that the craft were probably neither soviet nor german and officials at the base 
were convinced that these objects represented solid craft of some kind and later that evening at 
9 20 p.m the discs made a final pass over the base at an altitude again of about 8 000 feet 
and this cluster of sightings directly over one of the most sensitive military installations in 
the united states had an enormous effect on how the military would handle future ufo reports 
to handle the publicity end professor j allen heineck who was then the air force 
astronomy consultant for project sign which is the predecessor to project blue book he was called 
in on the case and as j allen heineck says and I quote I was impressed with this case 
one of the very first that came to my attention when I became astronomical consultant to project 
sein I remember wondering why the air force had not paid much greater attention to it 
and to a similar sighting that occurred at murak air force base just two hours later 
the witnesses were certainly excellent independent military men describing the most unusual sighting 
on a clear sunny day what more could the air force want heineck apparently did not know the 
full extent of the sightings nor the waves that they were causing at uh higher levels
he would later learn that his job as a consultant was basically to downplay the sightings and provide a possible astronomical explanation normally very skeptical of ufos 
heinek nevertheless gave this case very high merit and as his report for project 
sign reads in a quote no astronomical explanation for this incident is possible 
it is tempting to explain the objects as ordinary aircraft under unusual light conditions 
but the evidence of the tight circle maneuvers if maintained is strongly contradictory 
jaylen heineck was not able to take any further investigative action because as he says 
as an astronomical consultant my official responsibility ended there 
meanwhile officials at much higher levels in the military were realizing the seriousness of 
the situation and pioneering ufo investigator and blue book insider captain edward j rupelt 
called the case quote the first sighting that really made the air force take a deep 
interest in ufos researcher michael david hall author of a century of ufo sightings writes that 
the murak sightings had far-reaching effects as he says in a quote those disc sightings 
over murak on the 7th and 8th really shook up the pentagon and were the pivotal event which sprung 
the united states military into serious action on the saucer mystery the incidents led the u.s army 
air force to issue classified orders requiring reports of any saucer-like objects to be given 
to the technical intelligence division of the air material command at right field in dayton 
ohio the murak incidents threw matters into high gear and motivated the pentagon to ask for maximum 
intelligence effort from intelligence units around the world orders were then sent to all 
united states army airborne air bases requiring sightings near their area to be investigated 
ufo researcher richard dolan agrees as richard dolan writes the murak incident 
continues to provide evidence for military knowledge interest and secrecy regarding ufos 
so the above dramatic series of sightings marked the beginning of a long history of ufo activity 
that would soon escalate to incredible proportions and in fact it was just two 
years later that edwards air force base became visit was visited again by ufos 
it was at 12 15 a.m on the evening of august 31st 1949 when private pilot bob hanley 
who is described as a steady and reliable pilot was flying over mint canyon when he observed an 
object quote trailing a blue flame of exhaust near nearly a mile long he estimated that this 
object had an elevation of about fifty thousand feet and was located directly above the base 
hanley's two passengers also watched this incredible display and these they all uh reported 
their observations when they landed at lockheed air terminal in palmdale and at long beach airport
so at this point uh ufos started to come over the base on a much more regular basis 
in fact here's another report from author and researcher charles burlitz as charles 
burlitz's report says this next sighting occurred on june 24th 1950 when a navy transport plane and 
crew and several other pilots in the area all saw a cigar-shaped object 25 miles east of edwards 
this object also reportedly paced a united airlines commercial jet for more than 20 miles 
two months later august 10th 1950 a naval physicist by the name of lieutenant robert c 
wykoff was driving along u.s route 395 which goes right along the edge of edwards air force space 
and he pulled over and used binoculars to observe a quote large disc shaped object moving over 
edwards air force base many many cases here's an incredible case which was uncovered by the 
highly respected researcher leonard stringfield london stringfield is of course best known for 
investigating ufo crash retrievals and here's what he has to say about an incident which occurred in 
1952 as leonard stringfield says my information for one known ufo crash incident comes from 
from a professional employee in a technical position at a large general electric plant 
his brother who wishes to be unnamed was on duty as a radar specialist at edwards air force base 
in 1952 when he saw a ufo descending towards earth at great speed across his radar screen 
when the ufo was confirmed to have crashed the captain on duty gave him instructions you didn't 
see anything the specialist learned a short time later from base officials 
that an unidentified craft did crash in a nearby remote desert area the retrieved 
craft was more than 50 feet in diameter with a row of windows around its equator its metallic 
surface was in a burned blackened condition he also heard that the craft was occupied by 
humanoid bodies approximately four and a half feet tall according to leonard string's fields 
source this craft was held only temporarily at edwards before being shipped off to 
wright-patterson air force base in ohio wright-patterson is of course known for
the reverse engineering and the collection of crashed ufos
so more cases occurred on this year on september 30th 1952 edwards air force 
base again went on high alert when an aviation photographer by the name of 
dick beamer and two other witnesses cited two discs hovering and darting over the base 
in a letter to the president of csi of los angeles dick beamer who was an aviation photographer the 
north american aviation company described the sighting in detail as he says in his own words 
i went to edwards air force base to direct the motion pic picture photography of a flight test 
we had driven to the test site on the lake bed and were standing outside at 10 30 a.m carlos garcia one of our cameramen looked up at a b-29 which was passing overhead 
he said that he believed something had fallen from the plane but then discovered that it was not from 
the plane but seemed to be flying around then he noticed another I thought he was joking and 
i didn't pay much attention then gene pyler the other cameraman looked up and he too observed them 
by this time I joined the watching party and sure enough there was really something there we watched 
them for nearly 10 minutes they were flying at a very high altitude moving at an extremely high 
rate of speed much faster than a jet plane they left no vapor trails and made no sound each of us 
thought that there were at least three in flight but we could see no more than two at one time they 
moved in no definite direction for a short time 15 seconds or more one would hover while the other 
would zoom down past one side of it make a sharp turn and flash back above it on the opposite side 
they seem to be shaped more like flattened spheres rather than thin saucers in fact they looked 
and behaved somewhat like yo-yos they moved about quickly but seemed to have no particular 
destination they were somewhat metallic in appearance but seemed whiter than modern aircraft 
so it looks like they're putting on a display perhaps they want to be seen it's hard to say but it was just a short time later when edwards air force base 
had perhaps its most significant and profound ufo event and this is an event that has gone down 
in ufo history and we are still uncovering information about this event to this day 
uh this event occurred around february 17th to february 20th in 1954 when president eisenhower 
was visiting southern california it was at this time that the president of the united states 
allegedly had a face-to-face diplomatic meeting with extraterrestrials at edwards air force base 
and this story has circulated within the ufo community for years with accounts beginning 
at the time of the incident and new witnesses and evidence still being revealed even today 
it really all began when researcher harold t wilkins heard from an inside source 
that the actual purpose of the visit was not a golf tournament as was released to the press 
instead it was arranged so the president of the united states president eisenhower could view alien bodies and ufo craft that were being held at edwards air force base and to host a 
diplomatic meeting between humans and one or more extraterrestrial races and as incredible as this 
sounds these events have a surprising amount of confirmation in fact even the normal normally 
skeptical ufo researcher jenny randles writes and I quote the stories about this are surprisingly 
consistent another researcher who looked into this was william t moore and as he writes no doubt 
one of the reasons that this particular rumor has continued to circulate for such a long time 
is that there are a number of verifiable facts associated with it some of them rather curious 
clearly something unusual involving the president did occur on the evening of february 20th 
1954. so how this all rolled out was president heisen eisenhower came to visit palm springs 
and he suddenly disappeared from public view this much is absolute fact because the press 
who had been following his every move was suddenly unable to locate the president during this period 
and speculation about his whereabouts ran wild with some newspapers suggesting that he had died 
or even been assassinated and in fact that evening the associated press actually released an official 
statement saying that president eisenhower died tonight of a heart attack in palm springs 
but two minutes later the ap retracted the statement and later an impromptu press conference 
was called and the press was told that the president actually had an emergency dental visit 
later researchers attempted to confirm this alleged dental appointment with the dentist's widow the presidential dentist's widow who was unable to recall 
any details about the fixing of the president's tooth but recalled in detail the dinner with the 
president the following the evening other inconsistencies with the dental explanation 
are that president the eisenhower presidential library which maintains comprehensive records 
of eisenhower's activities shows no record of any such dental visit and when one considers that 
the fact that every move of president eisenhower was pre-scripted constantly observed and fully 
recorded the absence of the dental records seems conspicuous and as researcher william moore writes 
this would appear to suggest a cover story so one early researcher to claim that some sort of 
meeting between president eisenhower and aliens took place was british researcher desmond leslie 
shortly after the event desmond leslie claimed that he interviewed an air force officer who was 
actually present during this incident who said that it involved a landing a ufo landing at the 
base and according to this air force officer he personally observed a metallic disc 100 feet in 
diameter land in full view on the base runway the entire base was put on lock down put on high alert 
and all personnel returning to the base were not allowed to re-enter nor was anyone allowed to exit 
but we really owe author and researcher harold t wilkins for being the first one to reveal what 
went on during this incredible event it was harold t wilkins who broke this story wide open as he 
wrote one year following this incident and I quote in april 1954 I received an error mail letter from 
a friend mead lane we now know in california reporting a startling event in the flying saucer 
drama an unconfirmable report that president eisenhower in a recent visit to the edwards air 
force base california was informed that a recent investigation of five types of flying saucers 
by experts and technicians there had thrown them all into confusion and consternation it 
is alleged that the experts have reported on the materialization and subsequent dematerialization 
into a fourth dimension of invisibility of some type of the mysterious arrow forms of unidentified 
flying objects so yeah harold t wilkins broke the story and that letter was from 
mead lane who was then the national director of the borderland sciences research associates and 
later mead lane revealed his own source it turned out to be a fellow scientist by the name of 
gerald light gerald light was a ufo researcher and scientist who apparently had connections in 
very high places and in a letter to mead lane gerald light claimed to have actually visited uh 
edwards air force base with an elite group of people to view this incident and these people 
and are include some really amazing uh figures one of them was franklin allen of the hearst papers 
another was edwin norse of the brookings institute edwin norse was a financial advisor to former 
president truman also present there according to medellin was bishop mcintyre of los angeles 
and this letter from mead lane was the first solid evidence that this diplomatic 
meeting between the president eisenhower and extraterrestrials did in fact take place and 
i'd just like to quote extensively from this letter by uh gerald light because it is now 
quite famous within the ufo community as gerald light wrote to me elaine and I quote 
my dear friend I have just returned from murak the report is true devastatingly true 
when we were allowed to enter the restricted area after about six hours in which we were checked 
on every possible item event incident and aspect of our personal and public 
lives I had the distinct feeling that the world had come to an end with fantastic realism for 
i have never seen so many human beings in a state of complete collapse and confusion 
as they realized that their own world had indeed ended with such finality as to beggar description 
the reality of other plain arrow forms is now and forever removed from the realms of speculation and 
made a rather painful part of the consciousness of every responsible scientific and political group 
during my two-day visit I saw five separate and distinct types of aircraft being studied 
and handled by our air force officials with the assistance and permission of the 
aetherians the et's I have no words to express my reaction it has finally happened it is now a 
matter of history president eisenhower as you may already know was spirited over to murak one night 
during his visit to palm springs recently and it is my conviction that he will ignore the terrific 
conflict between the various authorities and go directly to the people via radio and television 
if the impasse continues much longer from what I could gather an official statement to the country 
is being prepared for delivery about the middle of may I will leave it to your own excellent powers 
of deduction to construct a fitting picture of the mental and emotional pandemonium that is now 
shattering the consciousness of hundreds of our scientific authorities and all the pundits of 
the various specialized knowledges that make up our current physics in some instances I could not 
stifle a wave of pity that arose in my own being as I watched the pathetic bewilderment of rather 
brilliant brains struggling to make some sort of rational explanation which would enable them 
to retain their familiar theories and concepts I shall never forget those 48 hours at murak 
so gerald light was apparently brought to this incident because of his expertise in the subject 
of ufos and after this letter was released it caused a huge sensation in the ufo community 
numerous investigators later attempted to contact both mead lane and gerald light 
neither of whom would respond and unfortunately both are now deceased 
so it was harold t wilkins friend mead lane who was the recipient of this letter and it was he 
who contacted harold t wilkins and as harold t wilkins writes and I quote from a reliable 
source in southern california I am assured that these five saucers did land voluntarily at this 
edwards air force base there were discs of five types and their entities invited the technicians 
and scientists to inspect their arrow forms and witness a demonstration of their powers 
i can positively assure you that a friend of mine visited edwards air force base soon after 
this demonstration he was accompanied by one a man prominent in the hearst news syndicate we 
now know that this is edward north to a bishop of either the methodist or the episcopal church 
we now know this is bishop mcintyre and three a formal confidential advisor to president truman 
who we now know is edwin griswald norse of the brookings institute and as there's mead lane 
wrote to wilkins in his letter I cannot release to you their names at this moment I also have 
confirmatory reports by two other persons but these would not carry weight by themselves 
the story has gotten out all over the u.s but not in public prints or newspapers it was of course 
given the horse left by the pentagon in the air command at washington dc but the basic facts are 
that some of our technicians and scientists have actually quote gone off the deep end mentally 
when the saucer entities confronted them with new and to them inexplicable physical data the 
entities demonstrated before their eyes that they could dematerialize and materialize themselves 
become alternately visible and invisible all this for our bright boys now you see it now you don't
so as you can see this was causing all kinds of waves among the officials at 
edwards air force base some who wanted it to go public others who did not 
and another person who uh who was able to get a first-hand testimony was brinsley lapore trench 
he is another ufo researcher brinsley lepore trench is actually the eighth earl of clankerty 
and a member of the british house of lords and the whistleblower who spoke to trench was actually a 
test pilot now our retired colonel who was present who was present when eisenhower made his visit 
as trench says and I quote the pilot was one of six people at the meeting 
five alien craft landed at the base two were cigar-shaped and three were saucer shaped 
the aliens looked human-like but not exactly reportedly these e.t spoke fluent english and 
informed president eisenhower that they wanted to start an educational program for the people 
of earth and this is when they displayed their technological abilities by making their ships 
turn invisible and according to this pilot the aliens wanted to announce their presence 
officially to all of humanity but president eisenhower felt that this would cause a panic 
so the ets agreed not to do this but stated that they would continue a limited campaign 
of contact so that humanity would in fact become gradually aware of their presence 
the et's also expressed great concern about our use of nuclear technology and they made an offer 
to president eisenhower get rid of all nuclear weapons and they the ets would give them 
spiritual wisdom and some limited technology so in one version of the events president eisenhower 
and another person who was there it was president eisenhower's personal friend mayor robert saunders 
reportedly they were both actually invited on board one of the craft and given a tour of the 
interior and perhaps even allowed to take a flight into space eisenhower was then told that the 
aliens wanted to begin this education program and eisenhower and his top aides discussed this plan 
and expressed again their fears that this disclosure would upset the economy and there would be a severe backlash from the religious community and president eisenhower 
reportedly stated that humanity was just not prepared for official disclosure and he also 
did not want to give up the u.s nuclear program in exchange for other technology or knowledge 
and this is where the meeting ended at a stalemate but as you can see the experts 
who were brought in there were religious experts saucer experts technological experts uh people 
of all different kinds in fact we'll get to some more of the people who were there in just a moment 
but another uh researcher who learned information about this event was professor robert s carr from 
the university of florida professor carr was one of the first people to really talk about 
ufos and crashed ufos within the military possession and in 1974 
professor robert s carr reported that he spoke with the firsthand witness of a ufo crash the 
crash retrieval actually in aztec new mexico and according to professor carr this same firsthand 
witness was also at edwards air force base when president eisenhower visited to view the ufo 
that had been recovered from the aztec crash and professor carr's announcement of this actually 
caused a media frenzy and many people tried to attack him within the press but professor carr 
remained steadfast and firm in his statements and absolutely refused to reveal his source 
uh in 1993 a huge break in this case came from dr craftman of encino california and he told 
researchers that he was there at edwards at the time of this event and although he didn't view 
the actual meeting he was present at edwards air force base on the day of this historic meeting 
at the time he was a sailor in the royal dutch navy and he recalled that on february 19th 
his commander was briefed about a highly important meeting that was to take place at edwards the next 
day and the next day at 10 a.m february 20th hank craftsman accompanied his commander to the base 
and once they arrived craftsman was shocked to see president eisenhower also albert einstein as 
well as german rocket scientist werner von braun another person he saw was the really well-known 
austrian inventor victor schauberger and howard hughes so a lot of really well-known people who 
were pretty much the top experts in their field whether it's religion economics rocket science 
you name it they had people there from every field of science 
and hank craftsman overheard his commander being told that there were five et craft in the hangar 
and that some of the et's were actually going to demonstrate the capabilities of their craft 
and at this point craft craftsman's commander left and went into the hangar in question 
hank craftsman was not allowed to go in but when his commander later returned hank craftsman says that he appeared his commander appeared pale and shaken and refused to give any 
details of what had just transpired and the next day they left the base never to return 
so more and more information continues to come out about this incredible incident a further stunning 
confirmation of this diplomatic meeting surfaced in december of 2000 when researcher stephen 
greer obtained an interview with don phillips who worked for the u.s air force for lockheed 
skunk works and the cia to develop aircraft construction and design and early in his career 
don phillips worked on highly secret projects and was an insider to many top secret events 
involving ufos including the now famous edwards meeting and as don phillips said in his first 
public interview and I quote we have records from 1954 that were meetings between our leaders of 
this country and ets here in california and as I understand it from the written documentation 
we were asked if we would allow them to be here and do research I have read that our reply was 
well how can we stop you you are so advanced and I will say by this camera and this sound 
that it was president eisenhower that had this meeting and it was on film sort of like what we 
are doing now so there you go more confirmation and the confirmation just keeps coming in 
further confirmation of this event comes from brigadier general stephen lovekin esquire general 
lovkin was a member of the white house army signaling agency and served under president 
eisenhower and president ken kennedy with an above top secret clearance and he has gone 
public about this incident he claims to have been involved in a number of high-level secret projects 
involving ufos and in fact he attended several above top secret meetings in which ufo sightings 
radar evidence films and actual recovered alien artifacts were reviewed and studied 
and as brigadier general lovkin says in his own words and again I quote there were stories 
about radar lock-on several of these stories came out of ohio at wright-patterson air force 
base but several others came from california texas and washington from what I can recall 
edwards air force base was mentioned as an experimental station when I say mentioned in 
that constant context I mean edwards was involved in testing whatever et materials they found 
it was said that was what was being done radar lock-ons had come from edwards air force base 
and according to general lovken president eisenhower expressed strong interest in 
everything concerning ufos and as general lovken says in his own words he meaning eisenhower 
would take to doodling and one of the things that he did doodle was various forms of ufos 
i never saw kennedy do this but president eisenhower did it and he did it in my presence 
as well as several other people who were attached to the white house army signaling agency where 
i was assigned I got an opportunity to travel a little bit with the president 
on some of these occasions he had just been given messages or had been given information pertaining 
to sightings or information about ufos and I know that for a fact because I was in the comm center 
and I saw that information when he would get this reports it would excite him he was very interested 
in the shapes and sizes of the ufos and what made them go very very much interested in fact 
i would say that this subject was probably among his highest interest at that time yes 
indeed so there's still more information that this event did in fact happen more confirmation 
of the eisenhower e.t meaning comes from well-known spanish ufo researcher antonio ribera 
in a letter to milwaukee based researcher richard hayden antonio ribera revealed that his 
friend and publisher mendez zabal fizzalde had attended a gathering at which miguel aleman 
who was the former president of mexico was present and when the subject of ufos came up 
fazalde and others at the gathering heard president aleman say that he met president 
eisenhower and that eisenhower quote told him that he once visited an air base in the southwest 
united states where they showed him a flying disc and the cadavers of several of its crew 
members another researcher who has looked into this case in depth is professor michael e 
sala he has researched some of these above accounts for his excellent book 
exo politics political implications of the extraterrestrial presence and after his 
investigations salah concluded that the meeting between president eisenhower and the nordic ets 
did take place as described as michael salah says and I quote there was telepathic communication 
they the ets were afraid we might blow up some of our nuclear technology and apparently that does 
something to time in space and it impacts extraterrestrial races on other planets 
uh more information comes from the eisenhower library according to the eisenhower library 
archivist jim leirzap he remains skeptical but nevertheless he admits that rumors have 
persisted about this incident for years as he says I quote we've had so many requests on that 
subject that we have got a person specializing in this so as you can see these are more than just 
rumors and instead of becoming weaker the story has grown stronger and stronger with more details 
new witnesses and independent confirmation coming from an increasing number of sources 
so probably the best confirmation in my own mind of this event is what happened at edwards 
following this meeting because while repeated sightings and landings and crashed ufos and 
alien bodies might seem incredible enough the story does not end there for the next 50 years 
this base continued and still continues to be a very strong magnet for all kinds of ufo encounters 
and many many of these involve various types of close-up sightings for example here's a quote 
from an anonymous resident to this area which occurred in 1954 this quote as this resident says 
saucer sightings have been there visibility there is usually 150 miles plus 
the few people there are outdoorsmen and outdoors women and are very observant here 
are located edwards and miroc air and naval bases where all the latest devices are tested 
the base atom bomb test like testing ground lies just over the northern rim of the desert no wonder 
then that plenty of flying saucers have come over the area to give the flyboy competition the 
raspberry and thumb them with the freemason sign also to keep an eye on what is going on around 
there a real another really interesting case occurred on april 18 1956 and comes from a student 
at beardsley elementary school which is located nearby as this witness says in his own words 
i was a kid at the time in the mid-1950s period attending beardsley elementary school 
we were on the playground and someone said hey look at that and we turned and looked to 
see three plus silvery objects hovering off in the west sort of traveling east 
and suddenly they made a sharp turn while doing so a teacher ordered us to get back inside of the 
school but I continued to watch as I watched the objects made swift movement west and disappeared 
all were flying together in a pattern it was the talk of the school for a few days I don't know if the incident made the papers because I didn't read papers as a child but 
i know that during the 1950s there were many similar sightings in california we had edwards 
air force base east of us but they had nothing like this and they were coming from that direction 
and actually turned and went the other way i've often thought of trying to advertise the event and see if any of my fellow students would agree that they had seen it
so one by one these cases are mounting and one of the most incredible events at edwards air force 
base occurred in 1958 and was first revealed by a journalist by the name of lee spiegel 
and this witness involves no one other than apollo astronaut gordon cooper so a really good witness 
according to gordon cooper he was project manager of the flight test center at edwards in 1958 when 
a large metallic disk actually landed at the base several air force personnel observed landing and 
were actually able to take motion pictures of it as gordon cooper says in his own words the disc 
was hovering above the ground then it slowly came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes 
there were various estimates by the cameramen on what the actual size of the object was but they all agreed it was at least the size of a vehicle that could carry normal sized people in it 
it was a typical circular shaped ufo not too many people saw it because it took off at quite a sharp 
angle and just climbed out of sight I definitely I think it was definitely a ufo 
so although he did not view the actual craft he did view the film which he says was absolutely 
convincing per orders he sent this film to washington dc and never heard from it again 
but on a later occasion researcher stephen greer conducted a follow-up interview with gordon cooper 
and as gordon cooper says and again I quote at edwards air force base I was having some 
of the cameramen film precision landings and we were right on the edge of a dry lake 
a saucer flew over them put down three landing gears and landed out on the dry lake bed 
they went out there with their cameras towards the ufo it lifted off put the gear back in the 
well and flew off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared so while I was going through all 
of the regulation books and finding out the number to call in washington to report this 
i had the cameraman go over and develop the film by the time they got back with the developed film 
i had higher and higher and higher level officers talking with me finally a colonel told me that 
when the film arrived on my desk to put it in a courier file there would be a courier at my office 
and they would arrange for him to fly in our base airplane back to washington with these films 
the colonel said to not run the prince so we stuck them in their courier packets 
according to cooper and I quote again these were good close up shots nothing like I had ever seen 
double inverted saucer shape it didn't have wings on it or anything it was pretty much the same 
shape at that point in time there was no doubt in my mind that it was made someplace other than here 
on earth according to cooper he did not believe that it was unique as he said to lee spiegel 
there were always some strange things flying around in the air over edwards 
so the edwards air force base story does not stop there there is something about the space 
that is extremely attractive to ufos and one of the most amazing incidents occurred on october 7 
1965 research researcher stephen greer not only interviewed one of the witnesses but was actually 
able to obtain an audio tape of the conversations between pilots air traffic control controllers 
and other officers as stephen greer says and I quote this extremely important case involves 
a seasoned air force traffic controller an official ufo officer four separate radar stations 
lock-on from onboard radar on a jet interceptor many hours and many objects over several hours 
the debunkers and those who would ridicule the ufo matter need to be able to explain away all of these elements and the voice tape of the actual event 
and this whole event would probably not have been revealed if not for a whistleblower by the name 
of sergeant chuck sorrells who is now retired from the us air force and in an interview 
with dr steven greer sergeant sorrells revealed the details of this entire ordeal 
and i'd just like to quote chuck sorrells here as sergeant sorel says and I quote this event 
happened on october the 7th of 1965 at edwards air force base it was on a midnight shift and I was 
the air traffic controller on duty in the tower at about 1 30 or so in the morning I noticed this 
real bright light to the east of my tower it was a light green and it had a red light underneath it 
the red light was a pulsating type of light and it had a white light on top that just glowed it 
was very bright quite large I observed it for quite a while because there wasn't any aircraft 
in the area at the time I called the dispatcher down at the base operations and the weatherman 
that was on duty that night and got them all to go outside and take a look I had one of the guys from 
the interceptor detachment that was on the base look also and I had the captain down there look 
we called it down to the air defense people at the los angeles defense sector and down there 
the director called around to his sites and at one point in time they had at least four 
different radar sites that were getting radar returns on it the ufos were getting seen at a 
couple of other towers like george air force base tower and there were a couple of other places that 
were seeing them so there were several people on the ground looking at these things and about 
four radar sites this went back and forth and back and forth for two three hours they finally 
decided to scramble an aircraft on it to go up and take a look at it and this was coordinated with 
other higher headquarters and I think norad was involved so sergeant sorel says that he was first 
observing this one bright light when suddenly three more objects appeared flew in formation to 
the south and began to hover in place and a little later three more objects appeared as sergeant 
sorel said they would fly individually around and go north south east and west a lot of maneuvers at 
this point I had seven of them at one time this is when they decided to scramble the jet interceptor
it was sorrel's job to help guide the pilots to enter intercept these ufos and as sergeant sorel 
says they were having no luck intercepting these ufos they kept asking me in the tower 
where was this object in relation to the plane about three different times he'd say contact 
and that contact means he had contact with something on his radar in the cockpit of the aircraft what it was we don't know to this day but they were real 
so these objects easily eluded the jet interceptor rising in altitude from two thousand feet to more 
than one hundred thousand feet in altitude and as sergeant sorel says and I quote they could move 
real fast they could be to the east of my field and then in just a short period of time they would be to the west they could probably go 30 40 miles in the time you could snap your fingers I mean 
just fast and they could rise go straight up it seemed like they could do that instantaneously 
at some points they would hover and just sit for a long period of time then they would move the smaller three individual ones had a lot more movement than the other ones 
the original very large ufo didn't move all that much and after a couple of hours though it moved 
a little bit but it didn't make any sudden fast movements until they tried to run and intercept 
on it and then it went straight up so three of these objects darted back and forth swooping down 
to a few thousand feet and then darting upwards at quote thousands of miles per hour sergeant sorel's 
noticed that the ufos seemed to hover mostly over the base's rocket test site which had recently 
been used for fuel mixture experiments so perhaps they were investigating this or perhaps they were 
putting on some sort of a display letting people at the base know that they were there 
but each time a plane was sent to intercept the objects darted away and when the plane left the 
objects would return as sergeant sorel says their radar people were having a hard time determining 
speed because they'd be in one place they'd sit for a while and they'd move real fast and by the 
time the radar screen got around to finding them the ufo was already at another location 
they could make quick turns and had all sorts of maneuverability that we didn't know anything 
about at the time it was a very strange evening he actually called it a ufo invasion 
and he kept quiet about it for many years until 1993 when stephen greer brought together numerous 
other military and government ufo witnesses like sergeant soros and had them testify before the 
united states congress was then that sergeant soros revealed his encounter which is again 
supported by an audiotape of the radio communications during the hours long event 
and stephen greer published this incident in his very important and ground breaking book disclosure 
and I would like to play just a few segments of this audio clip in which chuck soros describes 
this incident and other officers talk about what they are seeing
yes sir this is true i'm on with you right the man just went to get the tower boy there so 
she had somebody to confirm his story well uh takes record on they are they gotta call you 
okay recording from position imd35 on the incident you're pretty fast
and are you coming from north to south north to south right north to south at this time from edwards right
i have another red light and uh green light combination inside moving very rapidly over there 
i think this time i'm going to check on my rap connor see if they have any movement in that area
say if you all have any uh reports of unknown flying objects over there no we haven't okay 
we're wondering we supposedly are having quite an invasion over here what area in our area uh 
now it's all around uh victorville and edwards there I was wondering if any of your uh spikes 
or any of your bunches over there have called anything in no okay fine thank you much right
yes sir three on the bottom side yes sir well there's four all together right there's two in 
a line and there's three in the line you know the three in the line uh would run westward and 
on the other one running all up parallel with the brightness yeah right that's what you're seeing 
we're looking for about seven ufos
did they come from the northeast yeah no we came from the yeah northeast tv
there are about seven of them they're red white green flashing lights they have been
georgetown also uh
it started it was quite white and green it was flashing white and green you know it appears what the fear might be the bottom 
first appearance it looks like a sky yeah I mean they're not it's not intermittent
oh
haven't
heading west uh this time uh approximately uh 20 miles west of edward 
at 11 5 there was a uh we talked to center they didn't have anything on it but heading west of the area at 14 grand and he had no joy on the center quarry the bird 
uh let's see i'm holding them now uh with the birds that flew through 50 miles west of edward 
yeah now uh talk to the sergeant uh the ufo people at the edwards uh first place I 
should tell you that uh norton you will refer this back to edwards uh there's a lieutenant 
so that was not the end of course of the invasion of edwards air force base uh it continued to have 
all kinds of very dramatic sightings it was just two years later when another incredible event 
occurred on september 1st 1967 over edwards air force base and this account was actually leaked by 
a civilian employee of the base who accidentally saw the official report and according to his 
account in x-15 came in for a landing with the pilot claiming that he had been chased 
by no less than six ufos what's interesting about this case is the university of colorado 
who had been funding the robertson panel to study ufos tried unsuccessfully to obtain official data 
on this case but the air force base officials at edwards air force base refused to cooperate 
and would not give the robertson panel information on this case 
so while the air force was still trying to cover up the ufo events at edwards air force base 
so many people were involved that information continued to leak out and a big leak occurred 
in 1973 or actually the event occurred in 1973 and was leaked later in 1973 a man by the name of kent 
selen worked at edwards air force base as a crew chief for experimental aircraft 
kent sellin has now become uh fairly well known in the ufo community but at any rate 
one evening kent selen's supervisor told him to drive out to the north base to pick 
up a defective ground power unit this was not an unusual request however kent selen 
hoped to save time and instead of taking the longer perimeter road to the north base facility 
he decided to drive straight across the dry lake bed and this turned out to be a very monumental 
decision with quite uh interesting consequences for because as he came up from the other side and 
he drove up to several rows of quant huts and the door to the first hut was cracked open 
so he stopped and looked inside and to his shock he saw a typical flying saucer hovering above 
the ground as kent selen says in his own words and I quote this thing was flat on the bottom 
sloping sides I wasn't there for 15 seconds when I heard footsteps running up to me 
and before I could even turn around and look there was a machine gun barrel at my throat a gruff 
voice said close your eyes and get on the ground or were going to blow your head off 
sullen reports that he was then blindfolded a hood was placed over his head and he was 
taken into a room where he was debriefed for a period of 18 hours and during this debriefing 
he was told that the craft was in fact extraterrestrial and operated using anti-gravity 
it was some years later when he went public with this story and it's just more indication of how neck deep edwards air force base is in this ufo phenomena 
here's a very interesting case which occurred on july 1 1978 involving a rare report of a miniature 
probe-like ufo the main witness was working on a construction project for the local police when 
a small object descended from the sky and hovered over his head this witness has requested to remain 
anonymous but as he says and I quote I observed a very small object at one meter from me hovering 
alone I watched it it was almost transparent I couldn't see through it but it was as though 
it was liquid it was the size of a small orange silver in color when I finally yelled 
to the others who were on the other side of the building to check this thing out it moved away 
of course the others didn't see it it headed towards edwards air force base 
i guess since it was so small and no one else saw it I don't get many believers so it's just case 
after case after case going on here here's another case which occurred on february 10th 1977 and 
this involves another anonymous witness who was stationed at edwards air force base 
he worked as a security police officer in law enforcement and he had recently been training 
a newly assigned airman so as according to him uh at around 0 200 hours they were driving up to the 
rocket propulsion laboratory in their security police vehicle and i'll just quote him directly 
as I drove up a ridgeline so I could show him a complete view of the area while observing the area I spotted a large black disc shaped object appearing to be sitting on top 
of one of the laboratory buildings my trainee asked me what is that and I said I have no idea 
the object started to slowly rise up a couple of hundred feet from the building then slowly started moving in a circular motion towards our position 
i raised the microphone to our vehicle radio and tried to transmit when I realized our radio was dead we both attempted to use our portable walkie-talkie radios 
but both were also dead all our radios had been checked before and after guard mount next I turned 
on our light power as a signal device although we were in a desolated area many miles from the base 
the lights on the light bar rotated for about 10 seconds and then they went dead I could not get 
them to come back on we had no emergency flares when the disc was approximately 100 feet away 
our vehicle engine died I could not restart it I took out a remington 870 shotgun from its mount 
i opened my vehicle door gripped the shotgun in a death grip the disc shaped object a glassy 
black color about the size of two c5a aircraft wing tip to wing tip it made no sound totally 
silent I saw no lights I looked for any type of markings insignia I saw none the discs stopped 
right above our vehicle we just stared up at it it seemed to stay there for just a few minutes 
then it started moving again I could not see any type of propulsion system again no sound no lights 
it rose up to approximately 2 000 feet it stopped it started rotating from a horizontal position 
to a complete vertical position and then it stopped when completely vertical 
then the disk started spinning rotating very rapidly and shot almost straight up into the air 
and was gone from visible sight within seconds all of our systems started working the engine was on 
the light bar started rotating our vehicle radio was working the desk sergeant was calling us 
i answered and he said that they had sent patrols out looking for us we had missed our radio check 
evidently two hours of time was missing I looked at my watch it was 4 30 in the morning so 
apparently he had been abducted right from edwards air force base they both filled out 15 1669 
incident complaint reports and he knew that both would be read that morning by the base commander 
the desk sergeant told him that this object had been reported by our radar when it shot into the 
sky and here's where things went south for this anonymous witness as he says and I quote two days 
later we were told to report to the base commander when we were outside his office we were met by 
a full bird colonel wearing no name tag he was very tall at least six feet four inches gray hair 
and had sparkling deep blue eyes I went into an office with him and he told me to draw 
a sketch on a chalkboard of the object I did and then I described exactly what had happened he said 
nothing he he had no recording device he asked not one question I got the strange feeling he already 
knew what had happened I told him I would take a polygraph test but he said that was not necessary 
he said he believed I had seen something and he told me to never tell anyone what I had seen ever 
i left and my trainee went in next was a week later I was called back to see the base commander 
outside his office were two very large men in suits they looked like linebackers 
i knocked then entered his office it was the real base commander he told me to sit down 
he told me to sign these papers I asked to read them and he said that was not necessary 
i said I will read them first it was a non-disclosure agreement it stated I actually had seen a helicopter on a training mission with all the lights out 
i looked at the kernel and said sir this was not a helicopter it had no rotors no blades no sound 
sir this is a lie this is not what I saw when I started to tell him he told me immediately to shut 
up he looked scared he told me he did not want to know what I had seen this is a national security 
issue he said please sign these papers for both of us if you do not sign these papers 
you will go with those people outside my office you really don't want to go with those people 
i asked if I could get a copy of these papers he shook his head I told him i'm signing these papers under duress and protest I signed them several weeks later I 
got a remote assignment to go overseas I have no reason to make up a story like this I am a 
highly decorated veteran that held some very high security clearances I never believed in ufos until 
i had this strange encounter so yeah it's not only sightings it's not only landings it's not 
only ufo crash retrievals not only face-to-face meetings with et's people are actually being 
abducted right from the base and there is a very vicious cover-up going on of many of these events 
so clearly this is just the tip of the iceberg and here's another incident that i'd like to share 
which I know you haven't heard of because I was able to interview the witness directly he was on 
his deathbed and contacted me because he wanted to do his part for disclosure and he was afraid that 
what happened to him would be lost to history if he didn't tell somebody I was able to include this 
account in my latest book wondrous 25 true ufo encounters and like i'd like to share with you 
what he told me and i'll just quote him directly as this witness who wants to remain anonymous 
says my job for over 20 years was to provide specialized construction equipment to the 
california high desert including edwards air force base china lake lockheed helendale among others 
my customers were primarily tied to government contracts and prepared bids an equipment rental budget was one of the clauses that had little restriction our company began to 
apply 100 percent of the rental paid on the construction equipment to go to the purchase 
to make our profit we tacked on the usual 10 percent on new purchases 
in other words his customers at edwards air force base used a shortcut to get the equipment quickly bypassing the more official route of submitting a formal request 
which would need budget re approval and unwanted red tape so because of this this witness I spoke 
with was granted special access to the base and one uh evening in 1980 uh after one day in 1980 
an incident at edwards air force base left him pretty shaken as he says and I quote I was called 
to edwards by a longtime customer because what they needed did not currently exist in the design 
required I was given an annual base security sticker good for every base in my territory 
i was then driven to a building at the top of the rocket site mountain and handed off to my customer 
and during our walk to his office I ended up behind him while passing by a structure in the 
building the hair on my head and arms tingled and a thrumming sound could be heard and sensed 
there was a partially open viewport that my curiosity demanded me to open 
so he turned his head and looked inside and could barely believe his eyes as he says I witnessed a craft hovering in a chamber only attached to what looked like 
instrument cables it looked like one of today's streamlined mid-sized cars like a honda accord 
my customer grabbed me he kept jamming his index finger on his lips so I would not make a sound 
our meeting concluded without any mention of what I saw so he finished the job and left 
the base but often thought about what he had seen but he had no opportunities to investigate 
until one year later when this same employer showed up and asked this witness to rehire him 
as this witness says while he was at our facility we got into a joking pissing contest and I said I 
would no longer provide him with a thing until he told me what I saw it took some convincing 
but finally he got an answer as the witness says I took him to lunch and he said it was 
from a quote failed star wars program that was supposedly scrapped but became a black project 
counter-rotating magnetic fields were directed in a way that caused a hole or void to be projected 
in the desired direction of travel he mentioned tesla tech and said that there were dozens of 
these drones in use i'm an old guy here why not try to enhance the disclosure process he told me 
uh he and again yeah this full story is told in my book wondrous 25 true ufo encounters 
so what's going on at edwards is even more amazing than everything i've told you so far 
in april of 1991 a shocking story was revealed on a ufo radio show three separate witnesses 
phoned into this call-in radio program on kpfaam in berkeley california to reveal their experiences 
the past year while working at edwards air force base and the nearby china lake neva 
naval weapons facility all of the witnesses insisted upon complete enough anonymity 
one of the witnesses identified himself as a member of the green berets and a veteran of the vietnam war and he later worked on top secret military projects as a 
general contractor at nellis air force base scott air force base andrews and other air 
force bases including edwards in fact in 1990 he was contracted to work at edwards air force base 
where he and his co-worker had an experience that left a very memorable impression 
this witness said that the projects he worked on were quote mostly underground and he said 
that there were these bases were very large constructions electronically controlled with 
four foot thick concrete walls and according to this witness edwards air force base is a vast 
underground base reaching an estimated get this 30 stories down into the earth an elevator trip 
down to the site took more than five minutes and it was while working in this deep underground area 
that the witness made a startling discovery that extraterrestrials were actually working along with 
humans side by side at edwards air force base he entered his work site one day and was walking past 
a room with an open door and he looked in and got a huge shock several men were working in the room 
along with an apparent extraterrestrial as this witness says in his own words 
and I quote he was i'd say between eight and nine to ten feet tall he was wearing a lab jacket 
and talking to two engineers this being's arms were almost onto his knees it threw me into shock 
the radio interview asked the witness if perhaps he had met a deformed human being and the witness replied definitely not he had big slanted eyes a big head greenish skin and his 
fingers were extremely long no sooner had he seen this figure when a security guard saw the witness 
himself and quickly ordered him to leave and the experience was so unnerving for him he walked off 
the job the next day he couldn't take it later he was contracted for a job at nearby china lake 
and on this occasion he was working late to finish a particular job when one of his co-workers said 
to follow him that he had found something they needed to see and uh unknown to the witness he was 
about to have his first experience corroborated by yet another experience and according to him 
and i'll quote we looked in the window and there were these four little grey guys about three feet 
tall right then a security guard saw us and they told us we thought you guys left and they escorted 
us and said you're not allowed around this hangar this hangar is off limits to everybody you'll get 
yourselves shot the threat was obvious and the witnesses decided to keep his their distance 
however this witness states that his co-worker's mind had been quote messed with by the encounter 
and then on several subsequent occasions he sneaked into the hangar for another look 
and it turned out to be the biggest mistake of his life according to the witness he finally got caught and was kicked off the base af about three months later they 
found him mysteriously dead in orange county so this witness is totally serious about his 
account he realized how serious things were after his friend was killed and this event 
quote put kind of a scare into him but he still felt like this truth had to be told and as he says 
i know what's going on at edwards israel somebody's playing games with us 
so many other people have seen activity there one is ufo researcher richard boylan ph.d a 
fairly prominent researcher in april of 1992 richard boyland was touring the united states 
visiting various highly technological research and development installations such as area 51 
the tihan ranch in the tehachapi mountains which is actually 60 miles north of la and immediately 
east of edwards air force base and boyland learned that the northrop aircraft corporation 
was allegedly using this site to test and reverse engineer captured extraterrestrial 
spacecraft according to then southern california-based researcher william hamilton iii 
he also visited the site and interviewed insiders who revealed that the purpose of the location is in fact reverse engineering of et craft so on april 15 1992 
dr richard boylan staked out this area between 3 and 5 a.m and using a pair of binoculars he 
observed what he believes to be humans using and testing extraterrestrial technology 
from his location he could see the northrop installation and parked on the ground front of one of the hangars he observed several 50-foot wide craft and one after another these craft 
would slowly glow and then rise up and perform incredible maneuvers before returning to the 
base and landing and as richard boylan says and I quote I saw the same intensely burning bright 
orange gold craft being test flown there that I had seen above areas 51 and s4 as I watched four 
ultra bright gold orbs rose and traversed a brief one and a half mile test loop at intervals of 
about a half hour each orb took off and plied its course the first three took off from what appeared 
to be the southwest hangar of the north northrup complex he observed this for a few hours convinced 
of bill hamilton's claims and calls this location california's black budget
so that edwards air force base ufo connection should be very clear by now but uh let's just 
cover a few more recent cases another sighting occurred on the morning of july 25th 1995 
a civilian witness was driving by the base and saw a disc shaped object hovering about a hundred 
feet away as he says he's anonymous it was shaped like a saucer and it was rotating above a power 
line tower it was silver in color I live near edgewood's air force base I have seen everything 
that can fly from that base I have never seen anything like what I saw that sunday morning 
he said it emitted no sound and traveled so fast it was very hard to follow with his eyes 
another really amazing event occurred three years later in december of 1998 when 
an aerospace contracting consultant was on his back porch in victorville this overlooks edwards 
and he saw a large silvery disk high in the sky surrounded by several smaller orbs the object was 
stationary but was wobbling in the sky he used binoculars to observe this object he estimates 
it was very very high up maybe 75 000 feet he grabbed the camera and snapped a few photos 
and as he says often we see strange craft coming out of edwards air force base incidentally the 
craft would have been just south of the edwards air force base southern boundary he actually saw 
a jet aircraft pass beneath the object and as he says and I quote therefore the main object 
must have been much larger than the airliner and the smaller orbs about the size of the airliner 
keep in mind I viewed with binoculars I have 30 hours flight training and my wife is a 
private pilot I am not mistaking the sighting for conventional or any kind of typical experimental 
aircraft so many many cases and it's still going on here's a report from december 2007 
as this person says he was in an rv park which is designed for 
recreational vehicles this is near edwards air force base in mojave california right off the 14 
freeway when suddenly something very strange happened as he says boom 
this massive airship appeared now i'm guessing here about 1 000 feet away and 1 000 feet above 
the ground it's completely silent no approach we were staring right at it and it just appeared 
the first visual was the side view truly amazing probably 15 to 30 stories tall and the length of 
a football field no joke it was hard to process what I was looking at but I was blown away of the 
size and the massiveness of this craft it appeared to be black with thousands of light on the side 
very organized rows the lights appeared to be windows imagine a huge apartment building on 
its side flying in the sky there were no wings it was moving at about 100 to 150 miles per hour 
and then we got to see the back of the craft the rear of the craft was three massive red lights they covered the entire back of the craft from top to bottom side to side you 
could probably put seven airplanes in just one of these lights they did not blink at the same time 
but would alternate in a steady pace during this we were talking to each other freaking out discussing how this thing just appeared in front of us the size of it no 
wings the three massive lights on the back and we started to run through the desert after it 
it was off in the distance now just slowly cruising away but the three red alternating lights 
were still very visible then all of a sudden this bright white light detaches and just goes 
shooting out of the side visible to us and flew across the sky extremely fast the size difference 
was incredible it was about one one thousandth of this craft about three minutes later we heard jets 
screaming through the sky it was about eight six to eight fighter planes flying one after another 
looking for this craft so there's case after case after case february 11th 2010. here's another 
first hand eyewitness account as I quote the witness directly he says I work at edwards 
air force base and in the morning there was an unusually bright star to the right of the moon flashing red blue green white I got out my binoculars and I don't think it was a star 
seems other folks have reported the same event from different states not sure how long it lasted but I had to go to a meeting I sure wish I had my telescope and camera set up 
another case turn occurred later that year on december 18 2010 when a man and his daughter were 
driving by edwards air force base when they saw three fiery spheres uh dropped down out of the sky 
coming very fast towards the ground at some point this object went straight into the ground as he 
says he turned on the radio to listen to the news but heard nothing on the news about this 
there was no sound coming from it uh he thought it had crashed but there were no sirens 
and he says that there was nothing in the paper about this either but this object must have been 
huge and as he says and I quote this wouldn't be the first time my daughter and I have seen 
numerous unexplained things out here near edwards air force base uh one more case february 29th 2016 
two employees of edwards air force base saw what they describe as a bright string 
of lights arranged in a v or chevron pattern as the witness says neither one of us had ever 
seen an object like this there are many types of aircraft that operate at edwards air force base 
nothing we know of matches the behavior of these lights and here's a one final sighting which 
occurred right next to edwards air force base this was witnessed by a gentleman who was driving right 
by the air force base this occurred on november 4th 2016 and as the anonymous witness says 
we were driving east passing edwards air force base and I noticed an object traveling 
very fast across the highway it had a wobble to it because of the sun's reflection wasn't constant 
and it couldn't be unless it tilted I happened to take two pictures of it 
so there you go this is what's going on at edwards air force base it's not only 
sightings not only landings it's not only crashes it's not only face-to-face 
meetings it's not only the reverse engineering of ufos it's all of these and more as I said at the 
beginning of this presentation edwards air force base is definitely neck deep involved in ufos 
i studied this whole series of events in detail and wrote about it in my book ufos 
over california I also wrote that whistleblower account in my latest book wondrous 25 true ufo 
encounters so there was quite a bit of detail that I couldn't share here because this is just such 
a huge huge story and if this is what we know about within the public arena 
imagine what we don't know about what what has been effectively covered up i'm guessing this is 
1 100th of what's really going on at edwards air force base and that's why I call this presentation 
the ufo invasion of edwards air force base because it is our government knows a lot lot 
more than they're telling us and edwards air force base is ufo central for sure 
i think these events are very important I think it's only fair that the public knows 
about them and that's why I wanted to do this presentation I hope you've enjoyed it 
thanks very much for watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep having fun.
