ONBOARD AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT: SEVEN FIRSTHAND CASES
Jul 11, 2025

Summary:
Jul 11, 2025
The onboard UFO experience is the cutting edge of UFO research. It is the closest and most extensive of all encounters and holds the greatest potential to assist both contactees and researchers to better understand extraterrestrial contact. With tens of thousands of documented cases (and indications that they number in the millions) it behooves all humanity to take these accounts seriously. They have been occurring for over a hundred years, if not longer, come from all over the world, and are supported by a wide variety of evidence. This video presents ten extensive onboard encounters. In each of these cases, the witnesses were not only taken onboard; they were able to hold conversations with the ETs. Each of these cases provides fascinating and profound insights into what it’s like to have direct contact with extraterrestrials.

THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANNI LATTU. In early 1917, the residents of the small village of Jyrinvaara, Finland were puzzled by the disappearance of Anni Lattu, who lived in the area. When Annie returned, she shocked everyone with her claim that a silver craft had landed next to her cottage, and short little beings had taken her onboard. Although she was frightened, the humanoids were very friendly and took her on a tour across the world and into outer space. They offered her the opportunity to stay with them. Annie declined, and they returned her to her home, days later.

I WAS LIFTED INTO THE SKY. In the summer of 1953, Derek (age 5) was walking along a remote dirt road near his home in rural Phenix City, Alabama. He was nervous, as he had recently twice seen a Bigfoot-like creature in the nearby ravine. This time, he was shocked when a beam of light struck him from above and he found himself being lifted into the sky toward a metallic craft. Inside, he saw three humanoids, who assured him that no harm would come to him. He was returned, but that night, he woke up to see three even more unusual creatures in his room.

I WAS BEING WATCHED. In 1961, Joyce Halfin (age 6) was in her bedroom in Ottawa, Canada when she saw strange figures by her window. Suddenly she flew up in the sky over her house. She blacked out and assumed it must have been a crazy dream. But she knew it wasn’t and as she grew up, more encounters occurred. Curious, she tried hypnosis, and learned that in 1961, she was taken onboard by praying mantis-type ETs and physically examined. Later, she was taken again, and they told her how they pilot their craft and other spiritual information.

IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME. In June 1978, an anonymous high-ranking Soviet officer walked along the shore of Lake Pyrogovskoye in the Soviet Union when he was approached by two strange men in jumpsuits. They spoke to him telepathically, requested to speak with him, and quickly took him onboard a craft. A long conversation followed as the ETs answered all his questions. They gave him a demonstration of their craft and even took him to their planet. They returned him to Earth and asked him not to speak about his encounter.

WE ARE ALL BROTHERS. While hunting near his home in Baependi, Brazil, on May 16, 1979, Arlindo Gabriel dos Santos was amazed to see a small, strange object land in a nearby forest clearing. It was followed by two more. Then a large craft landed, and short humanoids emerged. Afraid, Arlindo turned to flee, but found himself being pulled onboard. The ETs held a conversation with him, explaining why they were there and where they came from. He was then returned. He suffered many physical symptoms. Strange landing traces were found at the site.

WE ARE JUST MEASURING YOU. On the night of May 28, 1991, Susan, a resident of Burien Washington, was puzzled by the unexplained barking of her dog. That night, she was woken in bed by an eerie blue light streaming through her window. Without warning, she found herself lying on a table in a strange room surrounded by gray-type extraterrestrials. They gave her a quick physical exam and returned her to her bedroom.

I COULDN’T LOOK AWAY. On the night of September 2, 2021, while cutting wood outside his home in Wasilla, Alaska, Andrew was puzzled by the appearance of a shining golden object in the sky. He became transfixed and started to receive powerful telepathic communication. The object moved lower, and he found himself rising upwards and into the craft. Inside, he was greeted by three short gray aliens who told him to stay calm and began to examine him. Returned 15 minutes later, he knew his life would never be the same again.

While some remain skeptical that people are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft and having face-to-face contact with ETs, those who have had this experience don’t have the luxury of disbelief. They not only carry the weight of knowing their experiences are true but dealing with a society that refuses to accept the reality of ET contact. Thankfully things are changing for the better.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
Today I'm going to be talking about the ultimate type of UFO encounter and that is the onboard experience. The title of
today's episode is on board an extraterrestrial craft. Seven firsthand
cases. I like this aspect of eupfology because these are the kinds of cases that I
think really have the most data to them, have the most potential to answer the many, many questions surrounding
extraterrestrial contact. And the seven cases I've chosen for you today
absolutely are very extensive. In each of these cases, people were able to
converse directly with the ETSs and get quite a bit of information about them.
So that I think makes these cases very important. These kinds of cases, I think, are the cutting edge of UFO
research and deserve far more attention than they're getting. Now, the seven cases I've chosen for you today cover
quite a period of time all the way from 1917 up into practically the current day and
again come from all over the world. The seven cases I've chosen for you today
include Canada, Finland, Soviet Union,
Brazil, and three cases in the United States, including Alaska, Alabama, and
the state of Washington. These are really amazing cases. Uh
several of them are supported by some very interesting evidence such as landing traces or physiological effects
or animal reactions and more. So this is not just people telling purely anecdotal
story. There is some evidence to support these cases. Either way, they're all
firsthand cases, meaning the witnesses do speak about it in their own words,
and that I find particularly interesting. So, let's just get started because this is going to be a pretty
long episode, I think. And the first case I want to talk about today, I call
the disappearance of Annie Latu. This is a very early case. It occurred in
January thereabouts, April of 1917 in Jiren Vara, Finland. And what makes
this case so interesting is that onboard encounters that predate the modern age
of UFOs in the mid1 1947 are exceedingly rare. And yet here we have one that's
quite an early case and it contains many of the elements we see in modern cases.
At that time the idea of being taken on board a craft and meeting with extraterrestrials was not really in the
public consciousness. Not in a factual way. And here we have a case which is
really extensive. So I think you'll find it pretty interesting. This case comes from Finnish researcher Moraurice
Hayamaki and it was published in the Nordic UFO newsletter and in the UFO
research of Finland annual report but it actually first appeared in the newspaper
Kirki Jollean and since then has been fairly widely published. This incident
took place in the small village of Jiren Vara, also called Alho according to some
sources, west of Kirkihoki, Finland. There does appear to be some confusion
about the exact location by Lake Kankin Lampy. Others say it's Lake Loga. At any
rate, the witness was Annie Latu, age 44. She lived with her husband in this
small village and was well known to the residents there. But one day in early 1917
in the beginning of the year, January, April, she disappeared. Local villagers
assumed that she had gone to visit her daughter. But upon her return, Annie said that no, she had actually been
taken into a craft by strange beings. According to Annie, she was walking to
her home carrying a load of wood through the snow, and this is when her encounter
began. She saw this craft. As Annie says, "I spotted it just before dusk. It
stood there as if it were part of the forest, yet it did not come from it. A huge metal bowl, like an upside down
sink, gleamed silently by the lake shore. The air was still, the birds were
silent." So Annie describes this object as metallic, huge, with a very smooth
surface, kind of reminding her of a gigantic wash basin or a soup plate. She
said it landed right next to her cottage. She could see a thin metal ladder extending from the bottom of the
machine. And coming down this ladder were short little figures, no more than waist high, she said, with long arms and
shiny eyes moving in a strange way. She didn't really describe them any further
than that. But again, at this time, UFOs and visitors from other planets were not
really part of the public consciousness. So, this never crossed her mind. But it was clear to her that these beings were
not human. So, she told herself, "Devils, they've come for me." Now,
weirdly, she felt no fear at first, just a strange silence. Then one of the
beings raised its hand and pointed at her. And she heard a voice in her head saying, "Come on." And her legs, she
said, seemed to move of their own will, and she found herself involuntarily walking towards the craft. At this
point, she did become afraid and tried to resist. But before she could, she found herself taken inside this craft.
And once she was inside, she was surprised to see that it was fully lit, and that the light cast no shadows. The
interior of this craft was very clean, shiny, and smooth, and also pleasantly
warm compared to the winter weather that she had been in moments before. And inside there were many of these small
little men. She said they moved very quickly. And she was also surprised that she was able to understand them. Without
warning, this craft took off in perfect silence. This also surprised her as she
was used to being on noisy trains which made a lot of noise. But when this thing
moved, it was perfectly silent. She said that there were many little seats inside the craft which also were very warm and
comfortable. And she said the beings were very friendly. Now, per Ammy, these
little beings flew her in their craft very fast all across the planet. all
over Earth, showing her many wonderful things. One of these beings appeared to
be the leader or it was he who communicated with her. Now, she wasn't sure if they were just wanting to
examine her or if they were trying to teach her something, but yeah, she said they showed her many things. She saw the
world from above. She described oceans, cities she had never visited before,
huge mountains, and at one point they took her out into outer space, showed
her the stars, which she said looked so close they were like sparkling flowers
on a black background is how she put it. So this went on for quite some time. Towards the end of the experience, the
beings offered her to stay. When she heard this, Annie became filled with
sadness and homesickness. And she told them no, she wanted to go back home to her normal life. And the next thing she
knew, she was waking up on the road in front of her cottage where she had been taken. There was some ice in her hair.
It was cold. So she went home and before long started sharing her story with the
local villagers. Now these people were pretty religious and they told her that
these beings must have been little devils. So she kind of accepted that explanation because she did not know how
to categorize this experience. And people really wondered about what
she was saying. They thought she was kind of strange. Perhaps she had gotten a bad scare or hallucinated or dreamed
the event or got a fever or was isolated as an old woman. But actually she was a
very respected person in this community and despite the skepticism of the many
of the people around her she stuck to her story and told anyone who would listen and told this story for years
without any change in detail. Another interesting fact is that she became very
well known in her community for her clairvoyance and her ability to read poems and her psychic abilities. How
amazing is that? All the details that Annie describes with her encounter are
details we hear over and over again. Telepathy, the interior of the craft being very
well lit with no discernable light source, uh being taken on a tour around
the world or up into space. Very, very interesting. Also very interesting to me
is that the ETSs offered to let her stay with them. uh she of course declined the
offer but a really interesting case because again at that time people were just not talking about this and although
there were quite a few skeptics in terms of the people in her village she stuck
to her guns she absolutely insisted her experience was entirely real also find
it interesting that she became very well known for her psychic abilities clairvoyance uh soothsaying as some put
it So that is another pattern we see with contactees and it's absolutely
prominent with that witness Annie Latu. So now let's move to the next case. I
found this one to be particularly poignant and so unusual. I have not heard a case quite like this. There are
many details of course that are quite familiar, but as always there's always some details that are unique. And as
you'll see, this case definitely has some high strangess to it. I call this
one I was lifted into the sky. This occurred in June of 1953
in the small town of Phoenix City, Alabama. This case is virtually unknown,
but I think it's an important case that deserves more attention just because it has such weird details and again really
poignant. This firsthand eyewitness account comes from a gentleman by the name of Derek. That is a pseudonym. He
wants to remain anonymous. It was the summer of 1953 and he lived on Cedar
Lane in Phoenix City, Alabama at the time. That was a very small dirt road,
quite isolated, very rural. It was afternoon and Derek was only 5 years
old. He was walking home after spending some time at the local market. And as he
walked down the north side of Cedar, he was very careful to walk on the far side of the street, as far from a nearby
ravine as possible. Because, as it turned out, while walking home on two earlier occasions, he had been
frightened by the appearance of a quote large, hairy, ape-like man, very much
like a Bigfoot, which was wandering among the cudzu that grew in that area.
And as Derek says, although the creature never threatened me, I was afraid to get
too close. So it was shortly after passing this ravine where he had seen this Bigfootlike creature that his UFO
encounter began. And I'll just quote Derek directly. As he says, I was
halfway across the dirt road when I was struck in the forehead by a bright narrow beam of light from above. The
beam was less than 2 in in diameter. It made no sound nor had any feeling, but
it was amazingly bright to be seen during a mid afternoon. I gazed skyward
and I saw a large gray disc suspended very high over the backyard of my home.
Immediately, I was lifted up into the sky at very high speed. Now, Derek didn't feel any sensation of being
lifted. Instead, it felt almost to him like he was falling, except for the
direction was definitely upwards and directly into the craft. Now, from this
point, his memory does get a little hazy, but he distinctly remembers being taken into this craft into a strange
room and seeing extraterrestrial beings. As Derek says, "My memory is clouded
about the ensuing details. I seem to recall being greeted by at least three
persons inside the craft. I can't describe what they looked like. I'm assuming they did not look like monsters
because I did not panic. I recall being on a table and something sharp was being
stuck into my left nostril. It wasn't painful, but it was uncomfortable. I
also recall being told it was a beneficial procedure. They weren't speaking words. We were communicating
via thoughts. I was also told not to tell anybody what happened. They also
told me that the hairy creature in the ravine would not harm me. The next thing
I recall, I was inside my house standing behind a sheer curtain in the parlor. I
don't know how I got there. So, Derek did not tell anybody, especially because the weird events had really only just
begun. That night, something incredibly bizarre happened that he knew nobody
would believe. As Derek says, "That night, I woke up in the middle of the
night and saw the hairy creature standing next to my bed. He was so tall
his head bumped against the light bulb that was hanging from the ceiling. And next to him was a shorter, similarly
hairy woman holding a baby creature. The hair on the adults lay flat on their
bodies. The hair on the baby was fuzzy and stood away from its body. Suddenly,
the baby jumped up from its mother's arms and bounced on my bed. She reached down to pick him up, and as it was being
lifted, the small creature peed on my bed. The father seemed perturbed by the
incident, and the three of them exited my room, went through the parlor, and out the front door. I never saw any
hairy creatures again. So, yes, this is quite bizarre. Derek knew this and he
did his best to forget these incidents. But there were several strange after effects from these encounters. For a
period of about 10 years following this, Derek suffered from boils on his body and chronic nosebleleeds.
He also began having many out-of- body experiences at night and would fly all around the house and the area where he
lived. Now, sometimes when he returned from his astral projection experiences,
he said he would slam into his body so hard he would physically bounce off the bed. Thankfully, following high school,
the nosebleleeds slowed down and eventually stopped. He grew up, began to work in the military as a soldier, later
as a commercial fisherman and a pest control technician. And he said he
always enjoyed really excellent health. As he says, I was an extremely healthy
person. I did not have a primary doctor. I was never sick. The only time I saw a
doctor was when I had injuries. Now, decades later, in 2005, Derek, now
around age 57, began to be bothered by something like a pimple in the inside of
his left nostril. Over the next four years, it continued to irritate him. and
suddenly it sprouted quote something that resembled a stiff hair. So he tried
using scissors to cut it, but the thing would not cut. So one day he just grabbed a pair of tweezers and yanked it
out. And as Derek says, it was not a hair. Removing that thing was very
painful. It looked like a section of thick monoilament from a fishing line. a
40 to 50 pound test line was more than an inch long, although less than a quarter inch had been visible when I
removed it. I tossed it into the trash. So, this is an apparent implant.
Now, four years after this, Derek was diagnosed and treated for throat cancer.
He barely survived, but he did. It was two years after that in 2015 that he
decided to make an official report about his childhood encounters decades earlier. And as Derek says, I never
spoke of these things to anyone. I tried to forget they even happened. There's nothing special about me. I grew up in
an area and an era when things like UFOs were not even discussed. It wasn't until
much later in life that I became curious. I am filing this report because things are only now becoming more clear
in my memory about unexplained things that happened in my life. I am curious
to know whether or not I may have had contact with alien beings. As you can
see, in many ways, that's your standard case of someone being taken on board and
examined. And yet, really unusual details with the Bigfoot connection. I
also found it interesting that this witness reported having excellent health for most of his life. This is a pattern
we see in so many cases. There's also of course the implant that is another thing
we see quite often. So yeah, a pretty amazing case by all means. All right,
now we move to another very interesting case which I call I was being watched.
This one occurred in 1961 in a suburb of Alta Vista. This is in Canada and a
super interesting case. This witness reports quite a few experiences throughout her life, but as we often
see, beginning in early childhood. In this case, she did use hypnosis to
recover some of her memories, but certainly did have some conscious recollections of encounters as well.
But another fascinating case that deserves to be wellknown. This case comes from UFO researcher and author
Robert Columbbo and was published in his book UFOs over Canada. The witness is a
lady by the name of Joyce Halen aka Joyce Aldrich. She's a journalist, an
artist, and a musician. It was back in 1961 when she was 6 years old that her
encounter occurred. She was living in a row house on Eastern Drive in an Ottawa
suburb called Alta Vista, not far from Rockcliffe Air Force Base. You can see
it here. One evening, she woke up and had a feeling that she was being watched. She looked to the window and
saw what she called spacemen. They looked like figures with large helmets and visors. The next thing she knew, she
was suddenly flying high up in the air, looking down on her housing complex. She
saw a big bright light and that was all she could remember. At that time she wrote it off as some kind of dream but
she never forgot about it. She always wondered about it because it definitely was not a dream and later in life she
started having more encounters. So she finally decided to go under regressive hypnosis and she recalled that she was
actually taken on board a craft at that time. And as Joyce says, the spacemen,
who I thought were wearing large helmets with visors, ended up having large egg-shaped heads and large insect-like
eyes. They came through the wall of my home, and one of them picked me up. We
then floated up to the ceiling, passed through it, and through the roof, where I remember looking down at a brightly
lit area. When I looked up, I saw a large circular craft ringed with two
sets of lights. We rose to the center area of the craft, and a portal opened
into a bay area. There were other beings standing there wearing different apparel
who were slightly taller than my companions who were only four to 5 feet in height. I was taken to what at first
looked like an elevator. A door opened and we entered a very dark room. I could
still see the aliens. They moved with the precise, graceful movements of a
praying mantis, deafly moving their large heads on delicate necks. So Joyce
stared at them in wonder and she was particularly impressed by their very large eyes. And at this point a
telepathic exchange followed during which the ETs explained that their eyes
were in some ways insectlike but where we see only the surface level of things
they can do an indepth analysis and actually see the cellular structures of things and beyond.
After this, an oval door opened into a corridor, and Joyce said, she was led to
a room where there were three or four more beings standing behind a kind of hospital gurnie or table, and they
placed her on top of it. And as Joyce says, I was told they were going to
check my eyes. First, they put a dark cloth over them and playfully lifted it
off an eye and then the other. Then they took an instrument to retract my lids so
they could have a closer look. A large machine which resembled an X-ray machine was held over my eyes. There were two
long tubes attached to it and the aliens said they were going to try to feed information into my eyes to see how much
could be implanted into the brain. Soon after the procedure began, I got a
terrible headache and asked them to stop. They did and I was ushered to a small stool to sit for a while and that
was pretty much the end of the encounter. Shortly later, she was brought back to her bedroom in the same
manner she was taken, but later she would have other encounters. A major one
occurred on June 29, 1989 when she woke up to see four beings in her bedroom,
each about 7 feet tall with extremely thin arms and legs and very small heads.
She really couldn't recall anything else consciously, but under hypnosis, she did
remember that she was again taken up through the roof of her house into a sort of boomerang shaped craft. The ETSs
told her it was a quote light ship that they used light to travel interdimensionally, and they went into
some detail about this. They told her also that the current earth space program is doomed to failure, but that
eventually physicists would learn how to use light to travel interdimensionally. They told her that humans are largely
stuck in the third dimension and that we think that death is the only way to reach a higher dimension, which they
said is not true. They talked about the tunnel that near-death experiencers see.
And as Joyce says, the light at the end of the tunnel is actually a portal to another dimension. The aliens said that
we can pass through the portal without dying and that we have to shake off our old ideas about space, time, and death.
So, it sounds like they're talking about astral projection, which anyone can do. Now, Joyce has since learned that many
other people in her family have had encounters. One evening, her young son described
what she believes was a UFO sighting. Her mother told her that she used to see glowing golden orbs entering her bedroom
all the time. And she also reported a wide variety of psychic experiences,
premonitions, billocation experiences, and once actually levitated right in
front of her, showed her that she could levitate. Also, her uncle told her that
back in June of 1959, while he was driving to work down Empress Street, he saw a bright
cylindrical object covered with flashing lights hovering in the sky. It then took
off really fast and was gone. Joyce does report having many other psychic experiences, and she later hosted her
own podcast about arts, entertainment, and of course, UFOs and the paranormal.
There are lots of details in that case that I found particularly fascinating. How the ETSs described to her that they
travel interdimensionally. I found that fascinating. Also fascinating to me was
how she described a history of UFO encounters in her family and especially
with her mother who reportedly levitated. That is super interesting to me because I've heard that with quite a
few contactees. And of course, the witness describes how she herself had some amazing psychic
experiences. Really, really interesting details in that case. So, now let's move to the
next one, which is somewhat well-known. I hadn't heard of it before, but it's a
fascinating case, which comes out of Russia. That alone, I think, is important because we don't get a lot of
cases coming out of this area. I call this next one, it actually happened to
me. This was in June of 1978 at Lake Pyroavsko in the Soviet Union.
And what's interesting about this case is that the witness is a highranking Soviet military officer. So, a good
credible witness. But some of the details he describes are absolutely
unusual. I've never heard them before. Some of course are very familiar. What's
really interesting is he does claim that he was taken to apparently another planet. So that alone makes this case
very extensive. And yeah, like in all of these cases that I'm presenting today, he was able to converse directly with
the ETSs. So I think you'll find it a pretty interesting case. This next very
interesting case comes from Russian eupfologist Nikita A. Schnei. The
witness is a high-ranking officer in the Soviet army by the name of Anatoli Malishev. Was one day in late May or
early June 1978. Anatoli was walking near Lake Pyrovsko.
Now I couldn't find the exact location. Uh, so I'm not exactly sure where this
is, but according to Anatoli, without warning, two very unusual looking men
grabbed him by the arms. Both were dressed, he said, in a very strange kind of dull-coled cellophane-like garments.
Anatoli had trouble remembering what their faces looked like, and he said he was overcome by fear. Then the beings
began to communicate with him, saying, quote, "We'd like to talk to you. It'll
take just a few seconds. Everything we'll talk about will be erased and you'll forget it." Now, per Anatoli, the
men didn't actually say these words. As he says, "I could feel their words, and
I in my turn didn't talk, but thought, and they understood me." So, he's
describing telepathy. And hearing these beings communicate with him, Anatolli's
fear lifted. And as he says, I felt light-hearted and free. He sensed that
these men were from another world and told them again through telepathy that he had nothing against talking with
representatives from another civilization. And the next thing he knew, he was inside what appeared to be
a craft. As Anatoli says, the next moment I remember myself being at a
table in a dome-like room. It was bright inside. The walls were bright and white,
but I can't say where the light came from, as I didn't notice lamps of any kind. There were two figures sitting at
a table, and I can visualize them only hazily. Part of the room opposite me was
in the dark. I could just see some small tables with buttons and a big screen
like a TV set. Though after hearing that these beings were planning on erasing his memory of the event, Anatoli became
determined to remember. So he says, "I had to try one of our old customs." And
he told them, "It's a rule here to celebrate such important meetings with a drink." So the beings brought him a sort
of spherical shaped glass tumbler with a liquid that looked a little bit like lemonade, but when he tasted it, he said
it had an almost salty taste. and Anatoli told them that such occasions should be celebrated with a stronger
liquor. Now they seemed interested and somewhat puzzled by this request and asked him for further information about
this. Anatoli was intelligent. He knew about the chemistry of alcohol and told
them he could write it down. So they directed him to stand by the wall and
told him to write it there. As Anatoli says, with slight surprise, I began to
write with my finger on the wall, and quite clear traces were left there. It
was just like writing on misted glass or on black velvet. I drew the formula and
structure of alcohol for them, and one of them said, "We'll make it right away." And disappeared into the gloom.
He then reappeared with a glass in his hand and gave it to me. Naturally, Anatoli was quite surprised by this and
asked them, "How is it that such a highly developed civilization does not use something like this?" And one of
them replied again telepathically, "Maybe if we used it, we would never
have been so highly developed." Anati felt like they were kind of joking with him, but he had more questions. So, he
asked them, "Why don't you help Earth's people in their struggle against evil?"
They asked him what evil and Anatoli told them against poverty, fascism, the
rich and so on. And their response was that they would have to help the poor
people and the rich and that it would ultimately be difficult to know whom to help and that they have elected not to
interfere and are here just to watch us. Now he asked them where they came from.
They told him that they were from another planet in another stellar system. He asked them many things and
they answered all his questions. Anatoli estimates that this conversation lasted for about 3 hours, but he was only able
to remember small portions of it. Now, at some point during the encounter, the ETSs told him to step outside of the
craft as they wanted to put on a quote flying show for him. So he stepped
outside, apparently still on Earth, though this isn't perfectly clear, and he watched the craft rise up 300 ft in
altitude, and it then proceeded to change shape from a classic disc, he said, to spherical, then seemed almost
to open up like a peeled orange. Then it went back to a spherical shape, and
finally a disc shape again. He was brought back into the craft, which now went into outer space. And per Anatoli,
they actually flew to the far side of the moon and the ETSs showed him what
appeared to be some kind of alien base there. They then flew him to their home
planet. They told him, per Anatoli, that their planet was three light years from
Earth. That's what he says. They told him they landed on a non-earth planet at
some type of what looked like a spaceport cuz he saw other craft landed on the ground. Discshaped craft stepping
out of the craft. The craft he was in promptly disappeared. Anatoli says that
this area was composed of some unknown material. He said the plants and trees
definitely looked foreign to him, not of earth. The sky was silver gray, bright,
but he did not see any sun. And the ETSs walked him over to a large screen about 10 by 15 ft. And this screen showed an
image of a dark complexioned man who seemed to study Anatoli for a few
moments. The ETS then guided Anatoli back to the original craft which had
reappeared and he was given he says a 40inute long ride back to Earth. Now
towards the end of the experience, one of the ETs told him, "Well, now erase the memory of everything we had talked
about." And the man walked to what looked to Anatoli like sort of a control panel, pressing buttons which caused
pulses to jump about on this computer-like screen, and they seemed to be having difficulty. Anatoli asked him
what was the problem and they told him that they were having trouble locating which part of his brain had been
affected by the conversation and finally they just turned to him and instructed him to not let anyone know that he was
able to remember this experience and as Anatoli says the next instant I suddenly
realized I was standing almost in the same place where I had been before meeting the aliens the sun was in the
same position at the same angle and the clouds seemed the same. It was as though only seconds had passed and
everything had happened in a profound sleep. Though he had an hour's long encounter and they took him back to that
same moment in time. He went home and told his wife who advised him not to
talk to anyone about this or he would end up in a mad house or worse jail. But
the next day Anatoli was still very impressed by his encounter. So he talked about it at work. And as Anatoli says,
during a break in the smoke room, I began to talk about the incident. The end of my story was accompanied by the
loud laughter of those who had been listening to me. So this persuaded him to keep silent, but as he says, I'm
pretty sure it actually happened to me. He did notice a few strange after effects. Immediately following the
encounter, after he left this craft, he realized that his clothes were fresher and cleaner than they had been before.
He also tried to write down his account and found himself physically unable to do it and could only relate the
experience verbally to researchers, which he did not long a occurred. Now,
researchers were very impressed by his case and his honesty. They traveled back to the location and investigated the
landing site. They didn't find anything unusual. They also brought in a couple
of psychics who were separately able to pinpoint the exact location of the encounter without being told where it
was. They questioned Anatoli in depth and at one point subjected him to hypnotic regression in the hopes of
obtaining new details. But Anatoli told the same exact story under hypnosis. Now
those who knew Anatoli considered him very honest and sincere. He had no prior
knowledge of or interest in the UFO subject. Anatoli in fact agreed to take
a lie detector test which he passed. So investigators were ultimately utterly
convinced that he was telling the truth. And as Nikita Schnee, the primary investigator writes, I would like to
stress that all the facts related in this case, incredible as they are, are
facts. All the events described actually took place and are not products of the
contact's imagination. It has been proved quite convincingly by the examination of the witness himself as
well as the landing site of the UFO. Our finding was that the case was neither hoax nor hallucination. We like that
case because it was very thoroughly investigated. The witness is quite credible. He had no need to use
hypnosis. It was fully consciously recalled and just an amazing case in so many
different ways regarding what he was told by the ETSs. him asking them to help solve our
problems and them explaining that no we can't do this. This is a theme we see in quite a few onboard encounters.
So yeah, super interesting stuff and an amazing case. Now let's move to the next
one. This one is quite well known I think in the country of its origin,
Brazil. Huge thanks to Chico for referring this case to me. I found it
super fascinating because wow, this one was very well authenticated, very well
researched. Has an enormous amount of evidence to it, including actual
photographs. So, it's almost undeniable that something really profound happened
to this gentleman. This occurred on May 16, 1979
in Bendi, Brazil. And again, this is an onboard experience where a gentleman had
long conversations with the ETSs and was shown many things and I think it's an
important case. This case comes from Dr. Liber Rojara, Franco Rodriguez, Maria
Jose Pereira and several others investigated it. It was published in the Brazilian UFO publication SBEDV
and in several other publications. It became quite wellnown. It took place in a rural area near Bendi. This is in
minus Jerus Brazil. And the witness's name is Arlindo Gabrielle Dos Santos. He
was a young farmer with very little education. It was around 10:30 a.m. on
May 16, 1979. Arlindo was hunting in a wooded area
with his two friends, Joseé Dilva and Olivera Prudente. They decided to split
up and each went hunting in different directions. So now alone, Arlindo saw
what he thought at first was a lightning flash. This was strange because it was a clear sky and was shortly later that he
came upon a clearing in the woods and was shocked to see a strange kind of glowing rectangular-shaped object only
about 4t tall coming in for a landing about 550 ft away. Now, in the past, he
and his father had seen some unusual lights. This was four years earlier while horseback riding, but those were
off in the distance, and this was close. So, he had some idea about UFOs. And Arindo describes this object. He said,
quote, "It was white and shaped like a post and two and a half palms wide and 1
and a half meters tall. On top of it was a sphere that blinked red and white. I
took my camera out and took a photo of it. Suddenly, it vanished before my eyes. Now, curious, he walked over to
the area to investigate. And this is when he saw a second object descending.
And as Arlindo says, this one was shaped like a top. It had like a little fan
turning around on top of it. Was shaped like a spear on the bottom, and that stuck in the ground. A moment later, I
heard a sound like sh and it disappeared in a cloud of smoke. I took a picture of the smoke. So he
stepped closer and this is when a third object came down. And as Arlindo says,
it looked like a wine barrel, red and white and about one and a half meters tall. It had a propeller spinning slowly
on top larger than the one on the other object. It came down wobbling from side
to side and then put down a leg like a stand for a TV set. Though this was really freaking him out. And then a
fourth object appeared. This was much larger and obviously a craft. As Arlindo
says, this one was white like snow and shaped like a large egg lying on its
side. There was a little window on each side of a little wing that looked like fins on a fish. When it was 1 and 1/2
mters from the ground, it stood still hovering and four legs came down to the
ground. So amazed, Arlindo lay down on the ground and attempted to photograph
it. But at this moment, the object sent a beam of light at him, which irritated
his eyes. He became very much terrified, dropped his camera, jumped up, and
attempted to run away. As Arlundo says, I was out of my mind with fear. I was
very afraid. I couldn't see, and I ran off, but I didn't get more than two or three steps away when something like a
magnet caught me. I couldn't move. I got very nervous and scared. I couldn't feel
myself. Then I saw two men at the egg-shaped object wearing black helmets
and coveralls. There were visors in their helmets. I wasn't feeling very well, and I couldn't make out any
features behind the visors. On their backs, they had small drum-shaped packs
with tubes that were attached to the helmets. They were wearing gloves, and the coveralls covered their entire
bodies. The two men came to me and each took me by the arm and I got even more
troubled and frightened. So at this point Arindo screamed out to them, "For the love of God, let me go." Now these
two little figures responded in his native Portuguese, quote, "In the name
of God, we are all brothers. We don't harm anybody. We only want some more
information." Now, he said the voices seemed to come from a box-like device on the being's backs, and that these voices
were low and deep. They led him towards the craft. As he got close to it, he
could feel an intense cold surrounding this craft. He saw another figure wearing a helmet standing next to a
ladder leading into the craft. This figure was looking back and forth almost
like a guard. This figure asked him if he had seen the quote zirka. Arindo did
not understand this word and asked them what it was and they said it was a communications device which they had
apparently lost. He asked them where they had come from and they told him we
come from the other side of the mountain. According to other translations they said we come from the
other side of the coast. So they asked him at this point if he was educated and he said no. He'd never been to school,
wasn't very smart. One of the short men took his hand, which he said felt very smooth and cool, and led him inside the
craft. And as Arlindo says, "As soon as I got inside, everything changed. I felt
I was in another world. It had a nasty smell, like dust on the roads. I saw two
other men sitting in armchairs, chairs like a dentist, and they appeared to be typing. They stood up and others came
and they started talking to each other. I couldn't understand what they were saying. So, in some of the descriptions,
he said it was actually a musty smell. There was equipment there that he couldn't understand what it looked like.
Uh, he said their speech really sounded kind of like a lot of hissing. Inside the air was very cool, very pleasant. He
said it was a large circular room about 25 ft wide with a domeshaped ceiling. A
bright light was coming from the center of this dome. On the walls, he saw a few what looked to him like colored lights
or buttons. And these men inside this craft, he said, looked human, but had
large slanted eyes, very thin noses, large mouths that went from one side of
their face to the other, and were also wearing dark, tight fitting uniforms.
So, the machinery inside he couldn't describe. It looked totally foreign to him. Another weird detail is he said
once he stepped inside, he seemed to forget everything about his own life. Now, moments later, a female figure came
into the room, which he described as somewhat heavy set, good-looking, with tan skin and long fine white hair. She
was wearing a white uniform and gloves, but did not have a helmet on. He did see
that she was wearing strange earpieces. She and one of the men, he put his hand
on Arlindo's shoulder. They led Arindo through a short corridor into another
room which was not much larger than a bathroom. One of them pressed what looked like a button on the wall and at
this point a large marble looking object shaped like a large refrigerator rose
up. Perindo was 9 ft wide, 4 feet tall, and had two screens on it. this point,
the female figure took a wand-like device and pointed it at this object, at
which point Arlindo saw colorful images on these screens. And as Arindo says,
the upper half of the box lit up and a round screen like a TV appeared. She
pointed the wand at it and said, "This is the sun. This is the moon. And this is where we are." She pressed a button
and the light went off. And then another circle on the right side of the box lit up in the same manner. A similar picture
appeared and she said, "Here is the Earth, the Sun and the Moon." And the
Earth turned and turned in the picture until it vanished. Then a little spot appeared on the top left and grew larger
and larger. This was their country. She said, "This is where we are. We come
from there and return in only a few hours." So Arlando had a little bit of a hard
time understanding what he was looking at. It was very confusing to him. He wasn't sure if these images he was being
shown were from Earth or another planet. The lady proceeded to talk about the rotation of Earth and how it affected
their ability to travel. Then they led him back to the first room. At this
point, the male humanoid took off his helmet, revealing a pretty much humanl looking face, but different. For Arindo,
his ears were pressed to the side of his head, had no real forehead, his nose was more sunken than a normal person's, a
very round head, and without moving his mouth, he told Arlando, "We are made of
the same substance, the same blood, and we live of the same kind of world as you
do." According to another translation, we do the same kind of work that you do.
Now, as our Lindo says, and I quote, "I was very, very scared, and I saw the
door open, and I tried to escape." The man said, "You can go down now, but
protect your eyes. So, I went down the ladder and ran across the field. When I got off, I couldn't move freely. I felt
restricted." Then, when I got to the end of the field, they freed me. When I turned around, the two objects had
vanished. I was feeling ill and nauseated and dizzy. I called for my
friends and they found me and gave me water to drink. Now, the duration of this encounter, Arlindo estimates, was
about 2 hours. Afterwards, he was extremely thirsty. His eyes were
swollen. He was suffering from headaches after the incident, which persisted for a few days, but he did also notice an
apparent healing. Since he was a young child, he suffered a sort of dermatitis condition with itchy white spots on his
skin. But after this encounter, these spots were gone and never returned.
Later, after he recovered, they went back to look for his bag. He had a bag
of food and other items, but they were unable to find it. Now, on May 28th, he
and his brother, Gyro, returned to the spot and were able to find four imprints on the ground where the object had
landed. You can see them here. Each of these four imprints were filled with small holes. And later, they did find
Arindo's bag in an area which they had already thoroughly searched. So, it
looks like it was put back there. Even more so, because it now had strange hieroglyphic symbols on it, which
weren't there before. They looked like they were drawn on. And according to the reports on this, they were somewhat
similar to ancient Hebrew characters or Phoenician writing, Egyptian Aramaic.
There were many attempts to decipher this writing and they mostly ended up
failing. The one researcher, Ricardo Ferrer Arantes, says that he was able to
translate it and that it is a message of upcoming calamity on Earth and quote,
"The developed races of space have the authority to lay the foundations of universal fraternity." So, I don't know
about that, but certainly interesting. This case was very thoroughly researched by numerous researchers over a period of
months. One of the researchers, Dr. Rodriguez writes, quote, "We checked
thoroughly into his character and background, and we found him to be totally honest and sincere and not the
kind of man who would make up a story like this. We talked to many people who knew Arindo, and everybody speaks highly
of him. We are convinced Arindo's case is true and that what he says happened
really did happen." Thank you again, Chico, for referring that case to me. I
found it super fascinating. The witness is so obviously sincere. It's really the
kind of case that's hard to deny and it's the kind of case that I think we
can learn a lot from. It's so interesting how many different types of humanoids they there are out there. Uh
and his descriptions are in some ways unique, but it's clear to me that we all
do share a common heritage. The ET is pretty much told this to the witness,
which is another detail that I find particularly fascinating because that
does turn up quite a bit. Just an amazing case in so many different ways.
Now, let's move to another case which I'm almost certain you haven't heard of. It has not received any real publicity.
I call this one, we are just measuring you. This one occurred on May 28, 1991
in Burian, Washington. And it's a pretty standard case in some
ways, but has some really important details to it. It doesn't stand alone,
too. There's other cases that have occurred in this same area, which is not very large, but I think you'll find it
really compelling. The witness in this case is Susan. That's a pseudonym. She is elected to be anonymous and she had a
few UFO sightings in her life, but it was an encounter on May 28th, 1991 that
changed everything. It started at 1000 p.m. when her pet German Shepherd dog
started growling and staring outside at the deck and then ran down the stairs to the basement, making low, defensive,
warning growls, and then ran back up to the sliding door by the outside deck and started growling again.
Now, Susan's home was located on the edge of a forested park in Burian, Washington. It goes down to Puet Sound.
You can see the exact area here. She had recently seen a little family of raccoons behind her house, and she
assumed that they were the cause of her dog's concern, so she didn't think much of it. She checked outside, but didn't
see anything. Now, strangely, she doesn't remember going to sleep that night. The next thing she remembers is
waking up in her bed to see a very intense bright light outside her bedroom
window. And I'll just quote Susan directly as she says, "I remember
thinking, why are the police out there? And what are they after that they are shining their spotlights on my window?
But I didn't hear sirens or radio or dogs barking or people talking." I
peeked outside and the next thing I know I was lying down on a bed or table. I
saw five beings with very big dark eyes that reminded me of insect eyes with a
big head and slender bodies. No mouth, a tiny nose protrusion, and they
communicated through my mind. One of them touched my forehead and the other two were checking my stomach while the
other two observed. The one by my head seemed to talk to me from my mind. He
told me, "They are just measuring me." A bluish beam above a bright light source
scanned my body, similar to a hospital scan. The next thing Susan knew, it was dawn and she was waking up back in bed.
For the first half of the day, she felt somewhat lightaded. And it was 28 years
after the encounter that she decided to report it to Muon. Now, at that time,
Burian had a population of about 28,000 people. It's only 10 square miles. Back
in 1968, actually, another encounter occurred in Burian, also involving
humanoids. Was on October 10 around 4 a.m. as a different couple drove down
1st Avenue South, just south of Seattle. You can see it here. Was still dark at
that hour. Now, the woman was 5 months pregnant. And I'll just quote her directly because she describes this very
interesting encounter with humanoids. As she says, "I noticed a very bright light
to the right of me behind a grove of trees as we drove down the road towards the bars packing plant. I turned and I
saw a large cylinder-shaped object hovering on the edge of a cliff behind a grove of trees with a very bright light
emitting from a brightly lit window within the object. It made absolutely no noise. It appeared to be stationary,
hovering on the edge of the hillside, motionless, and the size of a football field. I became frightened, and as I
stared at the object, I saw four entities with white egg-shaped heads,
large black eyes, and a small slit for a mouth. They were dressed in black uniforms. They communicated
telepathically to me somehow, saying, "Don't be afraid. We are just watching."
At that point, I turned to my husband and screamed, "Look, look." When we turned in the direction of the craft, it
had silently and completely vanished. Since that experience, I continue to
feel at times that I am being watched and observed on occasion. It was an eerie feeling. I have told no one about
this experience as it sounds so incredible. How could one believe me?
How amazing is that? Another onboard experience which follows the main pattern of people being taken on board
and physically examined. Totally consciously recalled. No need
for regressive hypnosis here. And it wasn't a particularly traumatic
encounter. They ETS just told her, you know, we're measuring you. So that is
super interesting to me. Uh I know that it's very scary for a lot of people to
have these experiences. But if you look at these cases very closely, you'll see that does not look like the ETSs are
intentionally trying to harm or hurt or scare people. No evidence that they're trying to take over. It's quite obvious
to me that they're very concerned about our planet. This is what they've said over and over again. So yeah, these
cases, I think, are so important in that regard because they really do answer the
questions about who are these guys? Why are they here? Where do they come from?
What are they doing on this planet? We have enough cases now, a big enough database that I think we've got really
good answers to all of these questions. And here's another case. There's always another case. And I call this one I
couldn't look away. This occurred on September 2nd, 2021. Very recent in
Wasilla, Alaska. really interesting and again very poignant case. For some reason, this one
just really kind of hit me in the heart center. This gentleman had such an
amazing encounter and he describes it in such amazing detail and I think you'll
find it a really interesting case. It was shortly after midnight on September 2nd, 2021, and Andrew, this is a
pseudonym, was outside his home in Wasilla, Washington, and he was splitting wood for his fireplace. He
usually performed this task late at night due to his job, and he was transporting a wheelbarrow full of cut
wood to his front porch and stacking it there. This is when he looked up and saw a quote striking glowing object. He said
it was bright gold hovering in the northeastern section of the sky. And the second he saw it, he became utterly
transfixed. As Andrew says, I found myself unable to look away. I didn't
feel a pressure of any sort on my body. I just couldn't look away. Quite literally. Words fail me, so please
accept my best attempt. It felt like I wasn't allowed to disengage. It reminded
me of the feeling I got once when I was bluff charged by a bear. A feeling that
something was happening that was going to happen regarding whether or not I
wanted it to. Looking away was not something my body would have allowed due
to some kind of instinctual process. though he's staring at this thing. The object quickly became brighter and
Andrew could now see that it looked almost diamond shaped was emitting tentacles of thick neonlike lightning
and as Andrew says was absolutely stunning was somehow beautiful. And this
is where I started to come to terms with the fact that something very strange was happening. It hovered in position for a
moment and then traveled at a very slow speed in my direction, stopping to hover
over my neighbor's property. It was at this point that Andrew began to hear a sound like quote fuzzy whispers in his
head. He said it was kind of like a deep static, almost subaudible, but it got slowly louder and clearer and evolved as
Andrew says, quote, into a whisper of what I can only describe as information.
Now I'll just quote Andrew directly as he says, "I was receiving a message that
without a clear language told me to stay calm while simultaneously bombarding me
with so much mathematical information that I was almost physically sick and
nauseous from it. It was like having a math stroke, layers of information that
shifted to a low sound that made me very nauseous. and I was suddenly watching my body watch the object as a second me was
drawn into it. The brightness of the vessel gave way as I got very close
about 10 to 15 ft. I was seeing an enormous golden skinned craft with zero
lines or rivets. The sound completely seized when I entered this area. I was
pulled into an opening in the lower half of the diamond. So Andrew could now see
that this craft had a dome on top. He was pulled inside of it and he immediately got sick and puked. He was
then confronted by three short gray ETs with dark eyes. He said they were
mumbling to each other with what he perceived as excitement. He started to feel a strange pressure on his back.
This caused him to lose consciousness briefly. He woke up what felt like moments later to find himself lying on a
sort of table as a wave of light swept over him, scanning his body. And as
Andrew says, I remember being physically examined by two of the gray beings, but
not partially. They almost constantly mumbled during the encounter. I could
barely hear it, but what I could hear was indecipherable. It sounded like a Middle Eastern dialect
being mumbled through a tube. The next thing Andrew knew, he was back on the ground where he first saw this craft. He
estimates he was inside for about 15 minutes. This craft was still in the
sky, but it now started to travel a quote very strange, seemingly random
pattern for maybe 15 seconds towards Anchorage and made absolutely no noise.
He was still hearing this strange staticky whispering sound, but as soon as the craft moved out of view, that
also disappeared. Andrew immediately sat down on the ground and he says he cried for several minutes. But then he
composed himself. His wife, who is disabled, was in the bedroom. She didn't see anything. He went inside and he
didn't tell her for some time because he knew that if he just blurted out what happened, it would sound like madness.
And as Andrew says, I cried several times that morning and the next day, and
I have an emotional reaction every time I try to remember or recount it. I eventually told her, his wife, a portion
of it, but I'm still terrified to tell her or anyone else about it. I had decided to just keep it to myself. Two
months later, he did finally report the encounter to both New Fork and Muon. The
head of New Fork encouraged him to contact the media, but Andrew declined because, as he says, I most certainly
did not care to be the subject of a local news story about UFOs in such a small place. Was not a large town. It
has about 10,000 people, but as it turns out, it does have quite a few sightings.
In fact, another report given to Mufon involves a Wasilla man who says that he
and at least one other witness saw what looked like a star in the sky. Suddenly, it zoomed down, hovered 5 ft off the
ground, and began to pulse in brightness. And as the witness says, after we watched it for maybe 2 minutes,
it slowly went down the road. We decided to go after it. That's when we saw a yellow saucer-shaped thing appear over
the power lines near where I live. The yellow crap literally appeared and
disappeared right before my eyes. It then appeared maybe 100 ft away and then
white orbs began falling out from underneath it. I watched as the orbs
would surround my neighbor's house. They would turn off all the lights in and around the house. Then they would light
everything up. It looked like the lights were searching the house and then they would move in. We watched that for maybe
15 minutes. So that's an interesting case and Andrew is certainly not the only Wasilla resident who believes that
they have been taken on board a craft and examined by ETSs. Consider this next
case completely separate which occurred to the lady by the name of Jennifer, again a pseudonym. She was 9 years old
in November of 1986. She had just been put to bed, but being a night owl, she remained awake and was
watching the stars through her windows when she suddenly noticed an unusually bright orange star. And after a few
minutes, it started to move and she realized that, yeah, this was definitely not a star. As Jennifer says, as it got
closer, it was giving off a lot of heat, like the sun. The next thing I remember, I was on a metal table, not strapped
down, but I couldn't move a bit as if I was being restrained. They surrounded
the table. I was screaming, and all of a sudden, my voice wasn't coming out of my mouth, but it was inside my head and so
loud. So, Jennifer stopped screaming as these beings began to talk to her telepathically. She did not describe
what they looked like, but as Jennifer says, they proceeded to poke and prod me through my belly button and between my
toes. They seemed to be trying to soothe me by stroking my forehead like my mother did when I didn't feel good. The
next thing she knew, she was back in bed, soaking wet as if she had jumped into a pool. She immediately ran and
told her mother. Her mother believed her and was a little freaked out. In fact, it was an event that they would often
talk about, but could never fully explain. Years later, Jennifer was watching TV and saw a segment about a
huge craft that was seen over Alaska in November 1986. This was around the exact time of her
own encounter. And as Jennifer says, I was frozen in shock. I looked at my
husband and said, "That's it. That's the UFO that took me." So that case doesn't
have a whole lot of detail to it, the case involving Andrew, but certainly
fascinating the way he describes it. And you can see it affected him so profoundly.
Immediately after this encounter, he breaks down crying. He's very scared to tell anybody. This is a pattern we see
quite often. It's very difficult sometimes to process these experiences.
But he did remember it fully consciously. truly amazing. Also very interesting is that there were other
people seeing humanoids in this town, which again isn't that big. So there you
go. Another amazing case of somebody taken on board.
And it's difficult to say how common these cases are, but I've said this
before. Jay Allen Heinneck reportedly said that one in 40 people have been on
board a UFO. That's a lot. And it was in 1991 that the Roper organization did a
poll and found that one in 50 people showed the markers of being a UFO
contactee. So the point is this is happening to millions of people. We we
now have a database of some tens of thousands of onboard encounters, but you
can bet it's a lot more than that. So I hope someday all humanity accepts the
fact that these experiences are happening. I think it's really important we take them seriously.
We need to move past the skepticism and ridiculing and gaslighting of UFO witnesses and give them a safe space to
share their encounters. It's one of the reasons I do this research because I know a lot of you out there,
particularly you who are watching this, have probably had encounters of your own. So I'm presenting this data in as
objectively in as a facts only manner as I can because there's so much
misinformation and disinformation and confusion and fear surrounding this subject. It's really unwarranted. It's
time that this subject goes mainstream and that we all accept the fact that we
are not alone in this universe. And all you have to do is go outside and look at the stars. And it's pretty obvious.
There's no way we could be the only ones living on a planet in this vast
practically infinite, as far as we know, universe. So that's it. Seven cases
coming from all over the world. I hope you've enjoyed this episode, perhaps learned something. I truly appreciate
it. It's because of you guys I'm doing this research and making these episodes. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And
