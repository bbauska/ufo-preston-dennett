THE UFO BREATHING POOL
Jul 18, 2020

Summary:
Jul 18, 2020
Are you ready to go swimming inside a UFO?
It's among the strangest of events that occur to abductees when they are taken onboard an 
extraterrestrial craft. They are placed in an aquarium-like tank and made to breathe a thick 
gelatinous liquid. Many researchers have investigated cases like these: David Jacobs, Barbara 
Lamb, Yvonne Smith and others. While there are several theories, the exact purposes of the 
UFO breathing pool remain unknown.

This video presents more than a dozen cases of abductees who have experienced the UFO 
breathing pool. What is it like to be placed in this liquid?  What kind of liquid is it? 
How are people able to breathe in this liquid and still survive? There are now enough 
documented cases to provide a clear picture of this unique procedure and the reasons 
behind it.

SPECIAL NOTE: THIS VIDEO ALSO CONTAINS MYSTERIOUS ORBS!

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  today i thought we'd explore a strange episode  
that occurs when people are taken on board a ufo  there are many strange experiences people have  
but this is definitely one of the strangest it's  known as the breathing pool and what a breathing  
pool is uh investigators are not sure but  abductees experiencers are placed into a vat or a  
tank or a tube of liquid and instructed to breathe  it it's apparently not water because people report  
that they are able to breathe this stuff into  their lungs it's often a very disconcerting  
certainly and frightening experience for abductees  so let's just get right into some of the cases  
uh david jacobs was one of the first to really  write in detail about this and i'd like to give  
you a direct quote from him according to david  jacobs and i'm quoting the aliens bring the  
abductee into a room with a large tank or even  a small swimming pool in it the aliens tell her  
to get into the tank the liquid is clear and at  first glance looks like water but it is not water  
the abductee is told to submerge  herself in the liquid and stay there  
she may be scared that she will drown but the  aliens reassure her that she will be all right  
she gets in over her head and then is told to  breathe she finds that she is able to breathe  
normally even though her head is underwater after  a short time she is told to get out sometimes the  
aliens dry are off but most of the time they do  not the purpose of the pool procedure is unknown  
now he says he has gotten a number of cases uh dr  jacobs he does quote one that's the case of james  
ostino who was having abductions by gray type  ets uh but he said they placed him into this  
not a very large tank it was about four feet  high uh and he they placed him in there he  
sank right to the bottom it was filled with  this liquid which he said was body temperature  
thicker than water but and he immediately  was able to breathe in it uh he said it was  
they pulled him out a short  time later and it was so thick  
he had to sort of rub the liquid off his body  with his hands so it's sort of like a gel  
uh okay another case comes from carla turner in  her book into the fringe she writes about the case  
of fred who found himself inside a tank with no  way out he was sure he was going to drown and said  
he had no choice but to finally breathe in the  water and relax when he found out he could breathe  
it's not the only case coming from carla turner in  her book taken she outlines the cases of a number  
of female abductees at least two or three of which  have had the same exact experience one was beth  
who found herself immersed in a very heavy liquid  and was amazed to still be able to breathe in it  
another is that of lisa who in october 1993  was made to enter one of these pools of  
breathable liquid this is not super common but  a number of experiencers have reported this  
uh kim carlsberg wrote an excellent book about  her experiences called beyond my wildest dreams  
and recounts a dream or a dreamlike episode in  which she remembered breathing underwater i worked  
with another abductee mike evans who co-wrote  the book the coronado island ufo incident with  
me he's had experiences his whole life he has  one very clear memory of being stuck in this  
aquarium-like tank and was able to breathe the  liquid underwater uh betty andreasen of course  
has experienced this she's uh been referenced in  a number of my videos she's had a lot of these  
very strange onboard ufo experiences uh and she  described the same thing being placed in sort of a  
chair-like device actually part of which came down  from the ceiling filled up with liquid and she was  
told to just breathe it it was very scary and they  told her that this is how they transport people  
what i find very interesting about this case  is i have another one almost exactly like  
it i interviewed the guy personally his case is  featured in my book inside ufos i call him taylor  
and taylor was had been wondering how the ets  are able to transport people and these objects  
are darting around at right angles and they gave  him a demonstration took him to a room there was  
this large chair made out of clear plastic  like a acrylic and just like betty andreason  
described part of it came down from the ceiling  and enclosed him and uh filled up with liquid he  
thought what are they trying to do drown me and  they just said just breathe just breathe and uh  
had no choice but to breathe and was  very surprised to see that he was able  
to breathe and the et's told him this is how we  transport people so that seems to be the main  
theory researcher yvonne smith has written about  these cases one in her book chosen an excellent  
book she talks about the case of mary who had a  very scary experience with the breathing pool she  
describes it very much like james ostino did about  four feet high sort of like a very large bathtub  
these gray type ets just put her right in it  and submerged her she said it was a greenish  
liquid it reminded her kind of of anti-freeze  and uh she thought for sure she was gonna die  
they were drowning her uh it was in a complete  panic until finally again she had no choice but  
to breathe and found that she was able to breathe  uh so there are quite a few cases like this one  
from england another guy interviewed personally  i call him gary his case is featured in my book  
on board ufo encounters and he had an experience  he's had experiences with grace his whole life but  
woke up on board a ufo inside one of these  tanks a number of cases are just like that  
people suddenly find themselves in these tanks  he said it was fairly large like bathroom sized  
his wife was with him and both of them were able  to breathe uh perfectly well without distress  
he saw greys walking around on a a level  above them they were enclosed in this tank  
and he also saw what he believed to be  human looking figures uh perhaps even cia  
type individuals or military you couldn't tell for  sure but they sure certainly looked fully human uh  
so yeah i mean i'm not sure what to make of these  cases there's a couple that were reported to mufon  
one is from an abductee in lufkin texas who says  and i quote they put me in a vat of liquid with  
other people they told me to inhale the liquid  for it was to replace the air in my lungs for long  
space travel again that's this theory that keeps  coming up another mufon case comes from knoxville  
tennessee a gentleman woke up around midnight  to his room his bedroom flooding with light  
next thing he knows six hours have passed and he's  waking up naked in the forest behind his house  
and goes back inside and over the next few days  or week or so spontaneously recalls what happened  
he remembers being hit by a beam of light and  pulled into an object hovering over his house  
inside he saw short elf like figures they had  pretty much human features but very tiny bodies  
and very large eyes and he says they put me into a  container which quickly filled with a green liquid  
that i could somehow breathe in even when fully  submerged it's this weird ufo breathing pool  
dan wright the director of the mufan  abduction transcription project  
referenced at least three cases of this kind  researcher barbara lam certainly has a couple  
she talks about one gentleman charles who's had  a lot of ufo experiences he was taught healing  
he was shown future disasters and of course  at one point he was put into one of these  
breathing pools his theory was that it was somehow  nutritional he was very relaxed it wasn't a  
fearful experience for him he saw other people  being put in these pools as well he was able to  
breathe inside which really surprised him and he  was also surprised that he had no fear and was  
so relaxed so that may have been induced perhaps  barbara lan has another very astonishing case  
from an abductee by the name of alice who  had a three day long missing time experience  
did not know what happened over a period  of three days under hypnosis recalled a  
very long ufo experience in which she was put  into one of these breathing pools in her case  
it was shaped like a sphere a metallic sphere  it had a little porthole but it was filled  
with this liquid it was about eight feet wide and  they put her through an opening put put her in  
it through an opening on top and she says she  was in there for at least a couple of days uh  
she was able to breathe it was very relaxing very  meditative and she kind of passed in and out of  
consciousness and occasionally she would see these  ets you know describe short figures wearing robes  
peering in through a porthole she was later  taken to a meeting with other et's and other  
humans were there there were other tanks she was  taken out she saw other people being taken out of  
the tanks as well she vomited up the liquid  it was pretty unpleasant she said but they  
dried her off gave her a robe took her and the  other abductees to some sort of alien meeting  
where they talked about humanity's problems  really our problems with war aggression
discrimination pollution nuclear proliferation  spiritual growth these kinds of topics another  
case comes from a very similar case  comes from researcher albert spateri  
a man was taken on board a ufo  undressed and put into a very large  
breathing pool he said it was 50 feet wide  with steep sloping sides kind of like a funnel  
and filled with this greenish dark liquid and i  said there was at least 15 other people in there  
uh most of them were panicking one woman was  screaming several were says it was very deep  
several were under water so to speak uh he tried  to hover on the surface he saw one man trying to  
climb out and the man was hit with a beam of light  which pushed him back in the et's told the witness  
that this liquid was nutritional he was you could  eat it it would sustain human life and you could  
also breathe in it and expel human waste in it  but it recycled that and uh the witness had the  
feeling that it was sort of like a holding tank  and that some of these people had been in there  
you know not for hours or even days but longer  weeks months or perhaps even longer than that  
uh so yeah there does seem to be some indication  that these can be used as holding tanks because  
people have seen certainly fetuses put in  breathable tanks onboard ufos quite often  
another case comes from nick redfern another  pretty prominent ufo researcher he talks about  
the case of andrea who was repeatedly  abducted by short dwarf-like humanoids  
and from the very first time and every time  she was put in one of these breathing pools  
she panicked and was very fearful the first  time i thought she was going to die she said  
this thing was had very thick liquid it re  reminded her of nail polish the smell of it  
and uh it was kind of like this giant bathtub  uh but found she could breathe in this thing  
and uh following that on subsequent abductions  she became pretty much used to it because they  
always did it and she theorizes that it's used  again to protect her from gravitational forces  
because on at least one occasion she felt herself  sloshing around pretty hard in one of these tanks  
nick redford writes about another case of a man  who actually woke up fully conscious and found  
himself inside one of these breathing pools in  his case it was this huge tube filled with warm  
greenish glowing liquid he had no  idea how he had gotten or where he was  
took him some time to get his bearing  he was floating in there and finally be  
began to recall how he had been taken into  a ufo from his home at some point he lost  
consciousness and woke up back in his home so  again we don't know what these breathing pools  
are but certainly there are theories the main  one being used for space travel researcher ron  
holtz he's a scientist has looked into these  and he believes what these breathing pools are  
are perfluorocarbons this is a super oxygenated  liquid uh you may have seen an example of this  
in the movie the abyss it allows a person  to breathe underwater much like aquaman  
it turns out these perfluorocarbons are super  oxygenated liquid they have more oxygen in them  
than the air itself 65 percent three times more  than air very low surface tension which allows it  
to sort of transfer oxygen into the bloodstream  also it has very strong wetting properties ron  
holtz thought that perhaps because of this this  would allow the ets to make very accurate volume  
measurements of the human body so yeah perhaps  there are scientific in you know reasons for this  
humans have done research into perfluorocarbons  for many years back in 1965 dr leland clark  
pioneered experiments with this involving mice  who he was able to keep alive for many hours  
underwater and i know there have been other  experiments involving larger animals such  
as sheep and even more recently there  was a russian experiment involving a dog  
who was kept on alive for a short period of  time and uh researching this is continuing uh  
in 1989 an infant girl was who was born premature  was treated with perfluorocarbons and was able to  
be kept alive longer than they expected as you may  know when a human embryo is in the womb they are  
actually breathing liquids so this is something  that our bodies are to a certain extent naturally  
evolved to do and there has been more research  in a lot of prematurely born babies whose lungs  
are not developed enough yet and so for example  thomas schaefer i did a study dr thomas schaffer  
and found that doctors were able to increase  the survival rate of premature babies from  
five percent to you know upwards of 60 percent a  vast improvement and for sure our navy has done  
research into perfluorocarbons to see if this can  help you know diving the experiments reportedly  
have not been super successful these liquids are  caused quite a bit of stress on the lungs and are  
hard to breathe for long periods of time so we  don't know exactly what these are for there's  
you know some possible my lab cases people  who are abducted by uh you know the secret  
military and put through this helmet lammer  sort of a my lab researcher talks about this  
krista tilton uh she's an abductee who was taken  to apparent underground base military base alien  
base said she saw humans uh in floating in tanks  helmet lammer talks about a case of a lady by the  
name of lisa who had this ex same experience she  said there were human military personnel there  
and she was forced into this tank of golden yellow  bubbly fluid uh and made to breathe it along with  
a number of other people so yeah this is what  we call the ufo breathing pool i did a study of  
these cases in my book not from here volume 2.  uh the purposes are unknown but as you it seems  
the explanation at least as offered by the ets  is to protect humans from gravitational forces  
this is the only explanation the ets have  ever offered though there does seem to be  
some indication that there are other purposes  such as possibly medicinal decontamination  
perhaps nutritional as some witnesses have thought  or even just storing humans a human holding tank  
and based on our own knowledge of perfluorocarbons  it does appear that this is what people  
are being submerged in at least some form of  perfluorocarbons i think these cases are important  
because they show not only they do they give  a window into you know the et agenda they show  
how advanced ets are with technology and for that  matter their knowledge of the human body so that's  
it for now that's my take on the ufo breathing  pool thanks for listening and keep having fun
