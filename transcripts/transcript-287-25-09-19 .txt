TEN TRULY STRANGE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Sep 19. 2025

Summary:
Sep 19, 2025
Firsthand face-to-face encounters with humanoid extraterrestrials are far more common than you might think. Cases like these have been reported for more than 100 years. They come from all over the world and involve a huge variety of extraterrestrials. The striking similarities between cases widely separated geographically and chronologically argue strongly for their veracity. Interestingly, many cases also contain rare or unique details of high strangeness, which reveal that we still have much to much to learn about extraterrestrial contact. This video presents ten little known cases that show these patterns, each containing fascinating insights with volumes to teach us about the alien agenda.

EIGHT-FOOT-TALL ALIENS. On August 7, 1954, two brothers were picking peas on their family farm in Saint Bernard de Lacolle, Canada, when a glowing spherical-shaped craft appeared and hovered overhead. Three 8-foot-tall humanoids emerged. The boys ran home and alerted their family, who saw the UFO, as did several neighbors. Later strange landing traces were found.

THAT UFO WAS LOOKING FOR ME. One evening in November 1966, three people observed strange lights over their home in rural Medford, Oregon. The next night, the 8-year-old son went outside and was shocked to see a 4-foot-tall dressed in sparkling blue clothes. As he fled in panic, the being spoke sweetly to him telepathically. Nobody believed him, but later, the UFOs would return.

IT WAS NOT A MONSTER. One afternoon in January 1967, an anonymous engineer was walking in the woods near Riachuelo, Chile, when he saw an odd light through the trees. Approaching, he was shocked to see a saucer-shaped craft hovering in a clearing. Moments later, a strange-looking man appeared. He had white skin, long white hair and wore a transparent white uniform. He re-entered the craft which left quickly.

HE LOOKED DIRECTLY INTO MY EYES. On the night of August 18, 1971, Jonah was camping in the forests of Carmel Valley, California, when a gray alien entered his campsite. It approached the witness and established a telepathic connection. It then placed an object beneath a log and left. Later, the witness retrieved the object which turned out to be a book.

WE CLUNG TO ONE ANOTHER WITH FEAR. On the night of August 18, 1978, two young brothers were driving near Harvey, Michigan. Suddenly a craft appeared overhead, and looking out at them from a window in the craft were two humanoids. Terrified, the two boys fled the scene. Arriving home, they reported the sighting to the local Air Force base. Shortly later, the UFO returned over their home.

IT RETURNED EIGHT TIMES. One evening in August 1978, the Martinhos family of Fuseta, Portugal, were shocked by the appearance of a sphere-shaped craft hovering right over their home. Over the next two months, the craft returned at least eight times. On one occasion, it landed, and humanoids emerged. Later, it hovered next to the neighbor’s home. A lady looked inside and saw two aliens.

FATHER AND SON ALIENS. Looking outside his living room on the night of August 6, 1980, Matthew saw strange lights outside his home in rural Mauston, Wisconsin. Stepping outside to investigate, he saw a massive craft hovering overhead. To his amazement, two humanoid figures were looking down at him. As they moved off, Matthew had the impression that the two ETs were father and son.

SOMETHING ALMOST DIVINE. One night in August 1993, Carol was 7 years old and enjoying a party with family and friend outside their home in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. Suddenly a huge craft appeared overhead, Looking down through one of the windows was a humanoid figure. Most of the group ran away in terror, but Carol and her mother watched in fascination, with a strong sense that the ETs were friendly.

SOMETHING VAGUELY HUMAN. At 2am one night in June 2001, two friends drove along a remote road in rural Ballard County, Kentucky. Suddenly their headlights illuminated a strange pale-skinned creature crawling in a ditch by the road. They stopped and it stood up to reveal itself as a gray alien. They took off in fear, and the gray began to chase their car down the road.

I COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING. On June 15, 2022, Jeff stepped outside his home in Albemarle, North Carolina, to smoke a cigarette and walk his dog. Suddenly a strangely shaped craft appeared in the daylight sky. He called out his girlfriend and both watched it move off. The next night, the girlfriend stepped outside and was confronted by a short humanoid figure with large dark eyes.

Ten cases, each taking us on a journey deep into the heart of the UFO phenomenon, each revealing what it’s like to have a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid, each with something to teach us about life beyond Earth. These cases are the tip of the iceberg. There are countless other cases, showing us undeniably that humans are not the only intelligent life in this universe.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs and the
Paranormals. I love talking about the humanoid cases. I find them endlessly
interesting. There's so many of them and I think they have a lot to teach us about what is going on with
extraterrestrial contact on this planet. The title of today's episode is called
10 truly strange humanoid encounters. I've chosen 10 cases that are not
wellknown. I'd be surprised if you've heard of these, but I think these cases are important because each of them has
unique elements, really strange features to them that are either very rare or
completely unique. Whether we're talking about the type of extraterrestrial
that's being seen or the clothes they're wearing or the way they behave or how people react to them, all of these cases
definitely have something to teach us about the nature of extraterrestrial contact. These cases cover eight
decades, reaching all the way back to 1954
up to 2022. So, we'll go on a journey through time and of course across the world. These 10
cases come from far-flung places on this planet. There are three from outside of
the United States, including Canada, Portugal, and Chile, and seven from
within the United States, including California, Kentucky, Michigan, North
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
So, I hope you find this episode interesting. These humanoid cases are just so fascinating to me. So, let's
just get started with the first one. First case I'd like to talk about today I call 8 foot tall aliens. This one
occurred on August 7, 1954 in St. Bernard de La. This is in Canada. This
case is super interesting because it does have quite a few witnesses. There are also landing traces. It's very well
documented and the type of ETS described is very unusual. This case was
investigated by researcher Adolf Ditmar. It did enjoy some minor publicity. It
occurred in the small town of St. Bernard de Laol. This is outside of Hemington, Quebec, Canada. This is a
small farming community, but it does contain an animal reserve which could in
some way be connected to this encounter. It occurred on the night of August 7,
1954. The Koopal family, consisting of Phipe and Irene Kal and their eight sons,
experienced an extraordinary encounter with a UFO. It began in the evening
after they ate supper when two of their sons, Gabriel and Henry, aged 13 and 11,
rode off on the family's horse out into the fields near their homes. They
dismounted and began to pick some peas out of their fields. And suddenly, this is when they heard a sound, quote, like
bees. Gabriel looked up and saw a glowing multicolored 9- ft wide
spherical-shaped craft, which was descending towards the ground, not too far away from their barn, and about 150
ft away from them. Now, this object stopped and hovered just a short distance above the ground and quickly
turned black, at which point it sent down a lad-like shaft towards the ground. One of the boys described it as
a, quote, "a black cable with a square thing hanging, making like a ladder. An
opening immediately appeared, and a very tall man emerged." Both boys at this
point became badly frightened. In fact, Gabriel, the older brother, grabbed his younger brother, Henri, and they jumped
up on their horse and both ran towards the house. Henri looked back and shouted
out, "I see a big man coming after us." So, this craft moved to a different
location and actually landed near the barn, and two other very tall figures
could now be seen. In an interview about 11 days after the event, the boys
described these beings, these men, as about 7 to 8 feet tall, wearing
skintight black rubber suits. They said they were well-built, and one carried a
device in his hand, which the boys described as looking like a machine gun. The men looked human, but had quote
great big round eyes and black hair that was quote not combed like the men around
here, cut differently. And it wasn't very long. The two brothers dashed inside their home after seeing these
figures and informed their family who rushed out to come see. None of them could see any humanoids at this point.
They were gone, but they did all see this object hovering in the sky, which now appeared as a glowing orange sphere.
and it remained there for more than an hour, actually moving around to different locations on their property
and in the neighboring area, touching down briefly on the ground several times. And there were other witnesses.
In addition to the Kal family, several other people saw this craft, including
Charles Edgar PH, you can see him here, and Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Luri, whose
home the object hovered over for just a brief amount of time. Later, Charles P
examined one of the sites where this object had touched down, and he found what looked like skid marks on the
ground and a 30 to 50 foot wide circle of flattened grass. So, that's an
amazing encounter, and it's not the only one in this area. Nine years later, in the summer of 1963,
nearby Hemingford would experience another dramatic sighting when around 1000 p.m. one evening, a married couple,
the wife's younger sister and brother and a couple of friends were all sitting on the porch of their home. And as the
witness says, we heard a sizzling sound. Up over the trees, we saw a huge round
object about the size of a bungalow flying from south to north. It was more
pear-shaped than round, about 200 f feet above the popular trees, coasting along,
barely moving. In fact, it had about 12 or 15 windows glowing with bluish light.
The windows were about 1 and 1/2 ft square with sharp corners about 6 in
apart, all in a line around the middle. The outside was a grayish flat silver,
not shiny. It coasted past the house, sailing over the bush, picked up a
little speed, and we watched it for about 5 minutes total until we couldn't see it anymore. We were all amazed. We
were sure we had seen a flying saucer, but we figured no one would believe us. I didn't tell anyone about it. This was
a small town. I didn't want to be laughed at. Now, two months later, the witness did hear a couple at the local
restaurant talking about a UFO they had recently seen and described it in the
exact same details. So, it was clear to her that someone else had seen this thing. Now, she didn't say anything to
them, but she didn't disbelieve them either because she says her own encounter convinced her of the reality
of UFOs. As she says, "I still have a very clear memory of it. Now I drive
trucks at night and I always look up. You don't forget a sighting like that. You watch for another one. If I'm
outside, I'm always looking up. What a fascinating case. I think there has to
be a reason that that UFO, those ETs were visiting that particular area.
Perhaps it was because there's a nature reserve there. We do know that ETSs do
have an interest in preserving the biological life on this planet. So perhaps that's the reason. It's very
hard to say, but the behavior of the UFO floating there for one and a half, two
hours, touching down in various places in this field really makes me wonder what they're up to. A really amazing
case. Now, let's move to the next one, which I call that UFO was looking for
me. This occurred one evening in November of 1966 in Medford, Oregon.
actually occurred over a period of time. We do see a number of cases where a UFO
shows up and this is followed by a much closer encounter. That's exactly what
happened in this case. I found this case particularly interesting because of how
the witness described what the ET was wearing. So, I think you'll find it an amazing case. This case does involve
multiple witnesses, but the primary witness reported his case on the condition of anonymity. So, I'll use the
pseudonym Eric. He was eight years old at the time of his encounter and lived with his family in a desolate,
mountainous, forested area outside of Medford, Oregon. One evening in November
1966, his mother and their landlord all noticed strange lights in the sky. And
as Eric says, they were all different colors of the spectrum and danced, revolved, zigzagged, climbed, and
descended. The show went on for an hour until they just got tired of looking at it. Nobody at the time knew anything
about UFOs and just thought they were helicopters. So, it was the very next night that Eric's family had a big
party. There was a band playing live music at their house. And around 11
p.m., Eric's father asked him to go outside and retrieve his cigarettes,
which he had left on the sideyard picnic table. It was a dark night, so Eric grabbed a flashlight and headed out and
into one of the strangest experiences in his life. I'll just let Eric describe it
in his own words as he says, "All of a sudden, I noticed a brilliant blue
sparkling at the base of our tree." I slowly walked up to the tree and a
three-foot tall being was standing there. The being had a white skin mask
over his entire head. It was tight fitting like a lady's nylon stocking.
There was no nose, mouth, or ears, and the being was wearing wraparound sunglasses. They were slightly farther
apart than our sunglasses. The blue sparkling that attracted my attention
was the coat that the being was wearing. It was a blue sequin jacket with a high
collar, and the jacket came down to his knees. His blue jacket radiated blue
sparkling action even in the dead of night. He was wearing gray dress pants with a crease down the front and cuffs
at the bottom resting on top of black boots. He was also wearing black gauntlet gloves. His arms seemed to be
very long. They went down to his knees. He stood motionless in front of the tree trying to camouflage himself. I got
scared, dropped my flashlight, and ran back to the house. Now, any thoughts that this being might
be a miniature human wearing odd clothes were dispelled by what happened next. As
Eric says, "I spun around to go get the flashlight. I ran up to the flashlight,
looking up at the being, hoping he wouldn't harm me, grabbed it, and fled with terror. As I did so, the being
communicated with me through ESP, and said, "Please don't be afraid." in the
sweetest way that anyone has ever spoken to me. When he said this, I felt a pull
or tug on my forehead forcing me back. But I was so terrified that he couldn't
control me. I went back inside and told my father that I saw a monster and couldn't get his cigarettes.
Now, Eric's father did not believe him and ordered Eric to go back outside and get the cigarettes. So Eric, terrified,
ran as fast as he could to the picnic table and scooped up the cigarettes. He quickly glanced at the tree where he had
seen this figure and the surrounding area, but this little three-foot tall being was gone. Now, as Eric says, and I
quote, "This story gets even more strange. I buried this incident in the
back of my mind and pretty much forgot about it until in 1971
I happened to see a book on UFOs in my junior high school library. I thought to
myself, "What is this?" I started reading it and to my shock and horror, it described what I saw years earlier. I
became a UFO fanatic, reading everything I could find on the subject. I would
spend hours every night watching the stars, wishing that I could see them again. I even started dreaming about
aliens and their flying saucers. So, this went on for some time, and then, as Eric says, one night it
happened. Says Eric, an orange glowing dome-shaped UFO was 400 yardd away from
me, hovering 100 ft above the ground in a subdivision, waving a bright spotlight
down on the ground, searching for someone. A woman in the area pulled over and got out of her car and slammed the
door. As soon as she slammed the door, the UFO took silently off diagonally,
leaving a fluorescent blue vapor form underneath the UFO. A white smoke ring
came out from under it simultaneously, making a sonic boom. Then the UFO writed
itself, then went through a spectrum of colors, then simply disappeared.
One full second later, the UFO reappeared two miles away. It stayed there for two seconds, then wobbled off
and disappeared in two seconds over a mountain range 20 m away. Without a
doubt, in my mind, that UFO was looking for me. I would love to follow up with
the witness on this case cuz I suspect he's probably had further encounters.
When someone has a humanoid encounter, it's rarely a one-off. Sometimes it is, but it's clearly not in this case. And
this case does show the pattern of a person being profoundly affected. Really, it changes their whole world
view. It's a fascinating case on many levels. And here's another one which I
found particularly interesting. I call this one, it was not a monster. This one
occurred one evening in January of 1967 in Ria, Chile. I like this case because
the witness is a professional. He's a trained observer. He describes his encounter very clearly. Also, this case
is not wellknown. In some respects, it's a fairly typical account of a UFO
landing and a humanoid being seen. But again, the humanoid is quite unusual,
and this witness was affected very profoundly. I always wonder when these
craft land and ETSs come out what exactly they're doing. Is this a display? Is this intentional? Is this
designed to contact the witness in particular? This case raises these kinds
of questions. This case was first published in the Santiago Chile newspaper La Tersera and it was later
picked up by the Argentinian newspaper Lacronica and also appeared in Lumiere
Don Lanui and in the Flying Saucer Review. The witness is Mr. C. He's
anonymous. He's a professional engineer. He requested anonymity because, as he
says, to avoid complications of being considered mentally disturbed. It was in
January of 1967 that he was on vacation and staying with a relative at the small
town of Riao, Chile. He enjoyed taking frequent walks in the forests
surrounding the town. And late one afternoon, and after walking for some time, he sat down on a fallen tree log
to take a quick rest. And as Mr. C says, my attention was suddenly drawn by a
powerful ray of light. I felt a dazzling sensation, and for a few moments, I had
those white dots that one sees when one's eyes look at the sun. I thought it
was a camera flash, but this sort of purplish luminosity remained in my retina. Afterwards, just as I was
preparing to leave, I noticed a strange brightness in a nearby place. I thought
that people on vacation in those places had lit a campfire. But to my horror, I
saw a fantastic vision, that of a flying saucer. I had never believed in these
stories or visions, and the versions given about flying saucers had often provoked jokes from me. Terrified, but
conscious, I tried to approach the craft. It was about 35 m in diameter,
that's 100 ft, rusty in color. It didn't touch the ground and had neither doors
nor windows. The saucer appeared to be made of a single piece without any orifice. An absolute silence, it lay
there, seemingly part of nature. The only thing that seemed abnormal about it
was the sensation of gentle warmth and the impression of suspended energy, such
as one observed on a deserted road under the burning sun. tenths. I was expecting
some monster to emerge from within when suddenly the saucer moved a meter to the
left without changing its distance from the ground in any way. My tension and
nervousness were great. My body felt stiff. The moment I tried to move, the
saucer rose slightly and something imprecise appeared. A sort of appendage
that quickly disappeared. So it was at this point that the encounter moved from a close encounter
of the second kind to a close encounter of the third kind. Because as Mr. C
says, I saw a being appear in front of the saucer. Was not a monster and it had
emerged as if coming from thin air. Its height was about 1.5 m, that's 4'9 in,
and its way of looking and leaning was like that of humans. My attention was
drawn to its transparent costume or suit which covered it down to its feet without any folds. It wore neither
helmet nor shoes. The skin on its face was very white, and its hair was long.
With its rather prominent jaw and flattened nose, it carried no instruments, and the arms of this
strange creature seemed glued to its body. I would have liked to speak to it,
but the fear of a possible attack held me back as I was very afraid. Without
anything lifting it, and without using a ladder or any other means, the being,
which was below the machine, disappeared inside it. Shortly after, the craft
seemed to inflate and emitted a strong purplish glow like the one it had upon its arrival. I rubbed my eyes to see
better. The disc had become an incandescent red, but it emitted neither
heat nor noise. It then began its vertical ascent at great speed, so still
very frightened, the witness went home as quickly as he could. He decided not to tell anyone, as he feared that people
might react badly. He returned to the site the next day to see if he could find any traces left by this craft or
its occupant, but he found nothing unusual. The experience did leave him
feeling ill for a few weeks, and it was this that prompted him to send a letter to the local newspaper describing his
experience. That's another case where I would love to see a follow-up with the witness. I have lots of questions for
him. Has this affected him for years afterwards? How does he feel about it?
Has he had further encounters? What does he think about all of this? It's an
amazing case. Now, let's move to the next one. This one is so unusual. I can't say I've
heard one quite like this. It does involve grays, but the behavior of the gray and the things it did are very
unusual, if not unique. I call this case, he looked directly into my eyes.
This occurred one evening in August 18, 1971 in Carmel Valley, Cal, California
in a pretty rural area. It's a really profound encounter with some aftermath
that I have seen before, but the encounter itself is so unusual. The witness to this encounter has requested
anonymity, so I call him Jonah. At the time of his encounter, he was camping
just off Kachuga Road between Kamsat Road and Trampa Canyon Road. You can see
it here. This is one mile from the Jamesburg Earth Station. It was a moonlit night, August 18, 1971,
and he was hiking back to his campsite when he saw a strange glow or orb of
blue light that appeared to be crossing the bridge over the creek just about 100 ft from his campsite. Now, as it reached
the center of the bridge, he could see that it was in fact a tall, slender figure, and it was carrying a plain
white bag of some kind. This creature moved closer and before Jonah knew it,
it was looking straight at him. And as Jonah says, I drifted into a more calm
state. The closer he came, I was drawn into his mind. Then I remembered
something. I may have gone somewhere because I have an image in my mind of turning off the bridge towards my
campsite. And at that moment, I saw a flash of his lower body and noticed that
the suit he was wearing was a neutral bluish gray, but it had tiny sparklings
all over the surface. I also noticed the belt at its waist. At first, I could see
nothing but a dark silhouette with a lighter facial area. When I was coming out of my blank mind, I could see a
little better, so some time could have passed. As he sat or kneled next to me,
I became aware of his hand on my chest. He stood up and turned and looked
directly into my eyes, and I watched a yellow light or energy pull back into
his eyes. In that instant, I clearly saw its eye area, and I looked through what
seemed to be an eye covering. There were very large irises, which took up most of
the area, and what seemed to be light, large, angular eyes. was four to 5 ft
tall, a thin build, a large cranium with large angular eyes. After a short
moment, he turned and walked away to the half log I was using as a table and lifted it up to put something under it.
The being then walked away, and Jonah fell asleep. Now, Jonah doesn't remember much after this, and in fact, the last
thing he consciously recalled at that time was just looking up into the being's eyes. So he did not remember
this last part until about a year later when he returned to the area to visit
the site again. And as he did so, it was as he says as if quote, "A window opened
in my mind and the scene became clear that something had been up under the
table." So before he even stopped the car, he began running towards the site saying, "There is something left by the
being." As Jonah says, I ran up to the log and lifted it up to find the bag.
Upon opening it, I pulled out the book, Learning Castellian Spanish. I wondered
why a language book. Now, Jonah does not report reading this book or trying to learn the language and says only that he
eventually gave it to an artist friend who unfortunately lost it. But he does
say that following his encounter, he experienced some profound psychic abilities. As Jonah says, I do not know
of others who have had a close contact experience have reported any change in mental capacities. I have always had
short glimpses into the future and a couple of paranormal experiences before my experience. Afterwards, I seem to
have a strong sensitivity to others thoughts. And in fact, Jonah provides a
few examples of this, including picking up a phone before it rings, singing in a
song just before it appears on the radio. He started practicing Buddhism and meditation, and he found that he was
very proficient in remote viewing and could visually see people in other rooms
very clearly or sense someone staring at him. On one occasion, he felt his
ex-girlfriend who practiced Wikah trying to cast some kind of spell on him. This
was the impression he got. So he called her up and she confessed that she and
her friend had in fact cast a spell on him in an attempt to get him to join their quote coven. So he just told her,
"Please don't do that again." He was definitely affected by his encounter. as
he says indeed something did change after the contact I don't see time and
space or life and death the same we do see that pattern of people who have
direct contact with extraterrestrials having a lot of paranormal and psychic experiences both prior and after that
pattern is definitely showing up in this case and it's really interesting to me
how the after effects of an encounter usually involve a person's psychic
abilities increasing to a great degree and of course changing their whole world view on what is possible in this
universe. But to me, the most fascinating aspect of that case is the fact that this ET dropped off a Spanish
book for this gentleman. Such a shame he didn't learn Castellian Spanish. Maybe
that would have led to some else going on. Hard to say. It's another case where
I wish there was wish there was a followup on it because I really wonder what's going on in that particular
interaction. So now let's move to the next case. Fear
is often a big issue in UFO encounters. We see it over and over again. There's
quite a few accounts in this particular episode where people are very fearful just by the appearance of a UFO and
humanoids. That's absolutely true in this case. I call this one, we clung to
one another with fear. This one occurred one evening in August 18, 1978 in a
rural area of Harvey, Michigan. And this is an interesting case to me because it
isn't a one-off. These two brothers had a very close encounter, and for some
reason, this UFO was showing a great interest in them. For what it's worth, this is my UFO story. This quote comes
from the witness who as a teenager had a pretty scary encounter with a UFO that
he will never forget. He's anonymous. I'll call him Thomas. That is a pseudonym. At the time of his encounter,
Thomas, age 17, lived on his own in a cabin along the Shaklay River in Harvey,
Michigan. This is not far from the headarters where the river feeds into Lake Superior and just north of Ki
Sawyer Air Force Base. It was around 8:00 p.m. on August 18, 1978.
Thomas was driving with his younger brother, age 12, along a country road
about 2 miles from his cabin. And as Thomas says, coming around a corner that
lined around a field, my brother and I saw this discshaped silver aircraft that
hovered with no sound. Now, per Thomas, this craft had a flattish shape with a
dome on top. And as he says, a window seemed to be the front top half to a
fourth of the craft. It appeared that two human forms were in this window with
a panel in front of them, like a desk or a control board. I say human forms
because they seem to have a round shape for a head, shoulder and arms, and a body trunk. I could not see faces,
clothing, skin, nor hair, just the shape of a human form. Two, I believe, in this
window of the craft. This craft was that close, just above the treetops. I'm not
sure if it was adrenaline from fear, but my lips rolled on my teeth. Not a drop
of saliva was in my mouth. I slowed for only moments, I'm sure, and drove away
very fast with my heart pounding. My brother and I never uttered a word. The
duration of this sighting was no more than 3 to 5 minutes. So they continued the drive to the cabin and Thomas
immediately called KI Sawyer Air Force Base and reported the sighting to them.
The officer who answered the phone told him that they had not seen anything on radar, but very interestingly added that
if the craft was truly just above the treetops, it would be invisible to
radar. Now, Thomas's brother was so frightened by the encounter, he refused
to sleep on the couch in the one room cabin, as he normally would have and insisted on sleeping with his brother.
Now, the windows in this cabin had curtains that were too short to cover the entire window. It was shortly after
Thomas reported this sighting to Sawyer Base and they had gone to bed that a brilliant light shone in through the
cabin window. And to their shock, the UFO had returned and it was directly
over their cabin. As Thomas says, "I swear this craft hovered over my cabin.
My little brother and I just clung to one another with fear. The light from this craft shone through the windows of
the bedroom." I was used to B-52s flying over constantly and never had this
happen before or after this incident. From that day on until about four years
ago, I've had dreams, nightmares of UFOs in the sky there down by the Shaklay
River. My brother and I didn't and don't speak of this incident. I'm now 42 years
old and he's 37. We both have families of our own and have not experienced
something like this since. Something did happen. We could see human forms in a
window-like windshield on this craft that hovered silently and we couldn't explain it and still can't. So, for what
it's worth, this is my UFO story. Everyone doesn't have one. I do. Budos
to the witnesses for stepping forward and speaking about their encounters. As we know, the vast majority of witnesses
don't talk about it. And these witnesses themselves rarely discuss it, even with
each other. This just goes to show how difficult it can be for some people to process a UFO encounter and how
profoundly it affects them. So, my heart goes out to all people who have these
kinds of encounters and have difficulty dealing with them. It's one of the reasons I do this research. I think
knowledge will dispel fear and once we know what's going on, it's a lot easier to deal with. So now let's move to the
next case. This one is truly astounding. I call this one it returned eight times.
This occurred throughout August and October of 1978 in Fucetta, Portugal.
This case is so amazing. There are so many witnesses, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions.
I mean the whole deal. and so many accounts of this UFO returning again and
again in particular targeting this one family or so it appears. So there's a
lot to unpack with this case. I think it's an important one. There's a lot of evidence to this case. It involves
multiple witnesses, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, and physiological
effects on the witnesses. It all began around 11:30 p.m. one evening in August
1978 when Maria Jose Martinhos, age 41, stood
in the courtyard of her home located on the outskirts of Fusetta, Portugal, not
far from the fisherman's quarters. There's also a large mining area just a few kilometers away. Now, suddenly,
Maria saw a glowing red light hovering among a grove of almond trees about 50 m
from her home. She called out to her son, Victor, aged 17, to take a look,
and he came outside, and as soon as he did, this light rose up from the ground and began to approach their house. They
could now see that it was a circular craft about 2 m wide with a small rectangular opening at the base. The red
light was coming from this opening and it was bright enough to illuminate the entire surrounding area. The surface of
the craft, they said, was a metallic gray and on the upper backside of the object, they could see a triangular
protrusion. Now, when this object continued its approach, Maria and Victor
became frightened. They turned off the light in their courtyard and hurried into the house. And to their shock, this
object approached their house, coming to within 1 meter of it, illuminating the
entire room. They watched as the rectangular opening slowly closed, and
the red luminosity of the object decreased, while the entire object became enveloped in a glowing white
light. The dogs in the area started barking furiously, at which point the
UFO returned back to its starting location among the almond grove, hovering about 10 m high and stayed
there. Now, during this time, the electric circuit breaker in the house was tripped at least four times. Three
other people in the neighborhood also saw the object. As Maria says, the light
seemed to hypnotize us all. It was a kind of numbing effect. In fact, her son Victor became so
frightened he actually wet himself. After an hour and a half, the UFO turned off its lights. Then it moved at high
speed towards the railroad tracks, moving over them and out to the ocean and was gone. That night, they skipped
dinner. And in fact, her son Victor went straight to bed and fell asleep. Now,
over the next few days, Maria said she experienced quote pains all over her
body. This forced her to go to the doctor and get medicine. Over the rest
of the month, day after day, this object came back at least eight more times.
Each time hovering directly over the Martino's residence, usually at midnight
and remaining to 1:30 a.m. One time it did arrive at 9:30 and left about
midnight, so it usually stayed about an hour and a half or even longer. On one
occasion, Miss Martin Hos's nephew arrived at the house by motorcycle at around 1:00 a.m. and this object zoomed
towards him, emitting something resembling flames from its underside. This caused the young man to run
screaming into the house. Now, later, the family did learn that children in
the area said that they saw this UFO land and some beings dressed in gray
jumpsuits emerged. Though investigators were not able to confirm this or get any more details, events were still in
progress because it was at 1000 p.m. on October 15, 1978
that another family, Antonio Viegas Menona, aged 71, and a well-known local
clairvoyant, and his wife, Leonor Diaz Martinez Vasquez, were at their farm,
which was next door to the residence of Maria Jose Martinos. So Antonio and his
wife Leonor observed a brilliant red light coming through the windows of their home. They rushed outside and to
their amazement only 5 m from their house and right above the ground bobbing
slightly up and down was apparently this same craft which they described as a gray metallic circular object spherical
pretty much identical to what the Martino's family had seen. They said it was 2 m wide. It had the same
rectangular opening at the base which emitted an intense red light which illuminated the area for about 50 meters
around it. They said it was totally silent. When it appeared, the dogs in the area began barking. Now Antonio was
deeply frightened by the appearance of this object and he hid behind a wall. But his wife Leonor was more curious
than afraid and despite her husband's warnings, she approached this object to get a closer look. And peering inside
through the opening, she saw something amazing. She described seeing two darkcoled armchairs. And standing in
front of the chairs were two humanoid beings. She said they were 1.8 m tall.
That's 5'9 in. They had strong robust bodies, and each of them were wearing
one-piece gray jumpsuits and gray helmets with two large round lenses
where the eyes would be. She was about 1.5 m away at which point this object
rose 5 m upwards 15 ft and then moved 100 m in a straight line then zigzagged
around two almond trees and continued off over the railroad tracks which were located just 400 meters from the house
and moved off towards the ocean. At that time Leonor's brother in a different area also observed this object as it
disappeared over the ocean and was gone. There's still a lot of questions about that particular case. Why was this UFO,
these ETs returning over and over again? I wonder if perhaps it's because there
is a large mining complex near this area. Something is drawing these UFOs to
this area. Could be the people themselves. It's very hard to say. Really unusual ETSs as well. Not your
typical grays that we often hear about. Hard to say for sure because the witnesses didn't get a really good look
at their actual appearance, but definitely a fascinating case on many levels. And here's another one that I
found particularly poignant and profound. I call this one father and son
aliens. This is a single witness case relying pretty much solely on anecdotal
testimony, but the witness does provide his firsthand account. I always love it
when we can hear directly from the witness. This one occurred on the evening of August 6, 1980 in a very
rural area of Mustin, Wisconsin. And it's just a fascinating account of a
gentleman seeing a UFO and humanoids very close up. The witness in this case,
Matthew, that is a pseudonym, was 21 years old. He had just quit his job as
an industrial painter and moved back into his parents' home located on North
19th Avenue in Mustin, Wisconsin. You can see it here. This is a very rural
area, and their house was particularly rural as it was nestled among the woods at the end of a very long curved
driveway. It was around 11:30 p.m. on August 6th, 1980 that Matthew arrived
home. His parents had gone to sleep, but his mother greeted him, showed him some food that she had prepared for him, then
went back to sleep. Matthew sat in the living room and was eating the food, and
he could see a large picture window that faced their driveway. As Matthew says, I
noticed what appeared to be a light shining at a downward angle at this bend in the driveway. My first reaction was
that someone had inadvertently driven down our driveway and maybe went off the driveway trying to turn around at that
bend. However, seconds later, everything that was white in the house, including
my white shirt, began to flues, just as it would under an ultraviolet black
light. I stood up and walked closer to the window. In the distance, I could see
a very tiny blue light pointing in my direction. The light then angled
downward as if it was searching the ground. It appeared to be coming from above the tree line and also appeared to
be coming closer. So it was clear to Matthew at this point that this was not a car and curious, he stepped out the
front door and stood on the east side of the house where he had a good view of the driveway. It was a dark, clear night
with many stars. And this is when he saw something unusual. As Matthew says, I
stood there looking around and heard what I would describe as a combination of a buzz and a hum above the trees. I
backed up to view the open sky area above the house. I then noticed something was blocking out the stars and
was moving slow and steady. I was somewhat confused because this thing was
big, like a large barn size, absolutely no lights of any kind, and too big not
to make a louder noise. I could not make out much in the darkness. The front of this object appeared to be vertical and
flat. The front had many black panels that sort of absorbed any light. The
object was moving very slow, almost walking speed or slower. As the object
moved overhead, I spotted a dull orange glow coming in my direction. It appeared
to be small, maybe four feet by 4 feet, a window with orange interior lighting.
Two beings stood in the window. The window was just at their waist level and
just above their heads. One large being stood and had its arms on the shoulder
of the smaller being next to it. I could not make out details except that the
heads appeared more round and the body shape was very skinny. I was stunned,
frightened, and wanted to run inside to wake my parents, but all I could do was look up in disbelief and shock. I
watched the craft or object pass over the house, and I saw all the stars again. The object went over the trees
and towards the north and disappeared. However, I could still hear the sound of
a soft hum for quite some time. Now, Matthew says that these two figures were definitely looking down at him. And as
he says, I also had the feeling that the beings looking down at me were father
and son and that they were just exploring. The next morning, he tried to tell his parents about his amazing
encounter, but they were not receptive and told him that he must have been overly tired and seeing things. So, as
Matthew says, after that, I never really spoke about the incident. This sighting
happened many years ago, but I finally want to tell this story before I get too
old. It's clearly a burden for many people who have this kind of experience and find themselves unable to share it
with their closest family. Such a shame. I think the UFO coverup has really
pulled a number on all humanity. People actually believe that these cases can be
explained away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. And then when they have
their own encounter, it's such an incredible shock. Obviously, those explanations don't hold water. There's
far too much evidence. There's far too many cases to explain them away that way. I'm absolutely convinced obviously
that we are being visited by extraterrestrials. And I think the cases themselves speak
very clearly towards this. And you can be skeptical of one case or 10 or 20 or
100, but there's literally thousands upon thousands of humanoid cases and
really good evidence that they number in the millions. So that alone, I think, is a good reason to take these accounts
seriously. And here's another one. This case was really interesting to me
because again we see people reacting very emotionally but on opposite ends of
the bell curve. Some people being absolutely overjoyed and excited while others reacting with extreme fear. I
call this next case something almost divine. This occurred one evening in
August 1993 in St. Mary's, Pennsylvania.
This is a multiple witness case. quite a few witnesses. A really fascinating
encounter. You call the witness in this case Carol. That is a pseudonym. She was only six or seven years old when she and
her family and friends had an encounter that would convince her forever of the
reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials. It was a warm summer evening in late
August 1993 around 10:15 p.m. as Carol, her mother,
and a group of about 10 people were in the backyard of their family home in the small town of St. Mary's, Pennsylvania.
They had a bonfire going, and Carol and four other kids were running around their forested backyard playing
flashlight tag. Carol had just been tagged again and feeling sullen about
it, decided to stop playing and instead go roast a marshmallow. And this is when the UFO showed up. Carol apparently was
the first to see it. As she says, "I was the first to spot it, come down, and
suddenly be right over the top of where a gazebo and bonfire were. It was a
hexagon-shaped craft, maybe 40 ft wide by 15 ft, maybe a bit larger, with a
green light at each of the hexagon-shaped points, and a red light on top of a pointed dome. It came
silently out of nowhere from the northern direction of the sky. It was a giant, completely silent craft hovering
above us. It was about 100 ft from us. I
pointed at it and said something like, "Look, a UFO." Then everyone else saw it, too. The adults came out from under
the gazebo, and we all stared at this object for many minutes. Now, to Carol's
amazement, several of the people there reacted with fear. After just a few moments of watching the craft hover
overhead, they became scared, dashed to their cars, and drove away. A few of the
kids who lived next door went straight home. But Carol's reaction was different. As she says, "I didn't feel
like missing a moment of the scene in the sky. I stood there with two other kids who stayed, a brother and sister
who lived on the street. My mother stayed as well." Within about 10 minutes of the craft being there, it ended up
being just the four of us. My mother didn't seem very surprised or concerned.
Now, in fact, her mother nonchalantly said, "Yeah, that's a UFO. Don't worry,
they aren't going to hurt us. They're just curious. Now, Carol was more amazed and astounded
than anything, though she became aware that the eight-year-old neighbor boy started crying and screaming in fear.
She didn't pay attention as she was riveted to the UFO, especially because of what she now saw through the windows
of the craft. As Carol says, I couldn't take my eyes off the craft. I kept my
eyes glued on it, taking in every detail I could. I didn't want to look away even
for a millisecond. As it silently hovered over us, it would tilt a bit to
the side, showing its windows on the upper side of the hexagon-shaped dome, one window for each side. The windows
were a yellow white light. I could see a faint silhouette of one being's head looking down at us. I could definitely
see something head-shaped looking out the window at us. Now, by this point,
the neighbor boy was hysterical with fear. He was having a full-blown panic attack and was screaming over and over,
"We're all going to die." His sister vainly tried to explain to him that they
were quote, "nice aliens, like the cone heads," she told him. But the boy was having such a hard time that Carol's
mother decided to drive him home. Harold didn't want to leave, but the boy refused to walk the short distance to
his home, which was just down the street. And as if sensing that the witnesses were about to leave, the craft
zipped up into the sky and headed to the east over the woods. So Carol, her
mother, and the two neighbor kids piled into the car, and as they drove off, Carol saw a group of about 15 people
standing in the parking lot of the gym next door to their home, staring up into the sky where this craft had just been.
They drove the boy home and Carol's mother had to explain to the boy's mother why he was crying and hysterical
with fear. Returning home, Carol searched for the craft, which was of course now gone. She fearfully worried
about their three outdoor cats. Her mother said, "Don't worry, they're fine." Later that night, afraid that the
ETs might come back, she began locking all the doors. But again, her mother acted nonchalantly and told her not to
worry that the aliens were quote just curious and wouldn't hurt us. The next
day, Carol tried to visit the two neighborhood kids, but their mother refused to let her see them and said,
quote, "Never ever mention anything about that night to my children again."
And she explained that her son had stayed up all night crying. Now, although they had been good friends,
that encounter ended the friendship and Carol never spoke to them again. Carol,
however, was amazed by the sighting. And in fact, she drew pictures of it. She was glad to have seen the UFO and the ET
inside it. And as Carol says, it felt like everyone just wanted to forget it
happened, except my mom, who just acted like it wasn't really weird to her at all. I will never forget the event and I
felt at peace and blessed by the sighting. I felt I had the opportunity to learn a mystery of the universe. I
felt I experienced something almost divine. I've known since then that there really are alien spacecraft that come
and observe us. Carol would later have a few other sightings and weird experiences, but none ever compared to
this childhood sighting. And as she says, "Looking back at how my mother responded and to this unique talent she
was born with that led her to be a very talented professional artist, I wonder
if they were interested in her. And I wonder if my first experience had not been her first experience. She seemed so
calm and relaxed the entire time. I found that I had the sense of peace and
serenity when I had my other odd experience as an adult. I can't explain
how my mother and I knew that they were only curious and meant us no harm. But I was sure they meant me no harm. I can't
explain why I felt that serenity. But I felt such peace that I'm not sure the
feeling fully came from within me. I have only felt that level of serenity in
nature and when that craft was present. How amazing is that? I mean, you have so
many witnesses. I really wonder if the mother did have other encounters because
the way she was reacting so nonchalantly certainly speaks towards the possibility
that this was something she had experienced before in her life. It's truly a fascinating case and shows how
difficult it is for people to process an encounter like this. Once again, we see
it wasn't a oneoff. I suspect that that was your typical UFO display where ETSs
come down and basically announce their presence with the intention of just letting people know that we're here,
that UFOs are real, that we're not alone. Hard to say for sure, but there's quite a few cases that fit that pattern.
Now, let's move to the next case, which again is very unusual. I call this one something vaguely human. This does
appear to involve a gray ET, but its behavior is really odd. This occurred
one evening in June 2001 in Ballard County, Kentucky. And like many
encounters, this one occurred while two people were driving late at night in a remote area. This case comes from
researcher Nathaniel Brlin, who published in his book Crawlers, a Conclusive case book. It's a pretty
brief case, but it's quite unusual. It involves two witnesses. One is Kimberly
Ashley and the other is her friend who uses the pseudonym Blake. It was one
evening around 2:00 a.m. in June 2001 that Kimberly and Blake were driving
along the back roads of Ballard County located in western Kentucky. Kimberly
was driving and Blake was in the front passenger seat. They had just turned onto a gravel farm road. There was a
large field with a tree line about a mile away. And this is when Kimberly noticed something very unusual. As
Kimberly says, I caught sight of something white and vaguely human crawling in the ditch. As we passed, I
hit the brakes, thinking it was a person who needed help. Now Blake also saw this
creature, and when Kimberly hit the brakes, he completely freaked out and shouted at her, "Are you crazy? Don't
effing stop. As Kimberly says, I looked in the mirror and I saw that it was
standing up. Even though it was still in the ditch, it was as tall as the stop sign next to it. It took a step towards
us and I hit the gas. As we drove away, I saw in the mirror that it had dropped
to all fours and was crawling after us. It crawled like a lizard down the road after us. No matter how close I was to
it, I never got a good look at it. It was fuzzy, like it was constantly out of
focus. When it crawled, it moved like a lizard. Hands and feet on the ground, elbows and knees up and out, wiggling
side to side. I'm not sure why, but something about it makes me think of it as male. Maybe the height. I didn't
start pulling away from it until I got up to about 40 mph. How about that?
Amazing, right? And here we have one witness who's ready to stop and take a closer look. is interested and curious
and the other witness is absolutely freaking out, totally scared and just wants to get out of the area.
This is again showing how fear plays such a powerful role in many people's
UFO encounters, hoping we can overcome fear. Overcoming fear has so many
benefits in every area of a person's life. Again, knowledge is power.
Knowledge dispels fear. It's really important we learn what's going on here so we can move past the fear surrounding
the subject. I honestly don't think it's warranted. Okay, let's move to the last and final
case in this episode. This one is also super interesting. In some ways, it's
typical, and some ways not. We do see the pattern here of people seeing a UFO,
and this is followed up by a much closer encounter. I call this one I couldn't
believe what I was seeing. This occurred on June 15, 2022 in Alba Marl, North
Carolina. And this is a really amazing case where a young couple had an extraordinary UFO encounter followed up
by a really closeup humanoid sighting. There are two witnesses to this case,
Jeff and Maria. Those are pseudonyms. their boyfriend and girlfriend and lived in a home in Elba Marl, North Carolina
when they had their encounter with a UFO and then a humanoid. The encounter began
with a sighting. Jeff went outside to have a smoke and walk the dog. It was around 1000 a.m. on June 15, 2022.
As Jeff says, I went out to have a smoke and walk the dog when I caught something
out of the corner of my eye, and I watched it get closer. I knew it didn't
look right. It was flying just above the trees about a mile away, slowly getting closer. When it got close enough to
comprehend what I was looking at, I realized it was not anything I could recognize. Not a plane. was rectangular
in shape, but it had an odd shape, like a big chunk of mangled metal, halfcloaked with orange, yellow light
along the bottom side of it. It looked like it was trying to halfcloak itself, but it wasn't, and it moved slowly over
my head. So, realizing he was seeing something he could not identify, a UFO,
he shouted out to his girlfriend, "Come look." And as Jeff says, I wasn't even
thinking about taking a video or yelling from my phone because I couldn't believe what I was seeing. And she came out and
watched it with me as it was just coming over our heads. It slowly moved across the sky and slowly ascended into a
cloud. We both waited to see if it would come out of the cloud, but it never did.
So both Jeff and Maria were amazed. Little did they know the most amazing part was yet to come. As Jeff says, the
next evening, my girlfriend was walking the dog. There was a big fig tree in the middle of the yard, and she saw a small
being looking around the tree or bush. It was a grayish green color with big
black eyes and long skinny arms. The dog started to freak out, so she grabbed her
and ran into the house, put a blanket over the kitchen window in case it was looking at us. She ran upstairs and told
me we were uneasy for a long time until we finally fell asleep. So, the
coincidence of seeing a UFO and then an alien being one day later was not lost
on them. As Jeff says, the entity sighting was a day after the UFO
sighting. I don't know if what we saw was alien or some kind of government involved craft, but I believe my
girlfriend when she says she saw something hiding behind the bush. All I know is I've never experienced anything
like that so close up. I've had UFO sightings in the past and after, but
nothing like that right in my face. I so wish I would have thought to tell my girlfriend to grab my phone, but I
wasn't thinking about that. It was just so unexpected and dumbfounding that I
didn't think about it. I just want to get my story out there so that we may be able to figure out what's going on with
all of this. Another amazing case. It's funny because so many people who have
these encounters never even think about taking a photograph. It's usually the
last thing that's on a person's mind. They are just so flabbergasted by what
they're seeing that they don't even think about taking a picture. which is such a shame because we could really
have a lot more photographic evidence. Thankfully, the photographic evidence on this subject is mountainous.
A lot of it currently is littered with fakery, AI, Photoshop, and things which
make it very difficult to find the actual genuine photographs. But the
evidence for this subject is absolutely overwhelming. It's not just eyewitness testimony by
any means. There's photographs and films and landing traces. There's animal
reactions. There's electromagnetic disturbances, physiological effects, radar. I mean, we're seeing a lot of
evidence in just this episode alone, which just goes to speak of how much evidence there truly is because these 10
cases represent just the minutest fact fraction the actual number of UFO
accounts. So, there you go. 10 cases from all over the world reaching back to
the 1950s all the way up to the 2020s showing again how ubiquitous this
subject is taking place pretty much all over this planet. So, thank you guys for
watching. I truly appreciate it. I hope you found this episode interesting and perhaps learned something about the
extraterrestrial presence on our planet. I truly appreciate you guys watching. So, thank you, thank you, thank you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for the truth. It's up to you to find it. And most important of all, keep having fun. And I'll see you next time. Bye for now.
