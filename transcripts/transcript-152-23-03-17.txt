INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACTEE PART SIX: FLIGHT SCHOOL
Mar 17, 2023

Summary:
Mar 17, 2023
How would you like to fly a UFO? It’s not as unique as you might think. In fact, contactees all 
over world are reporting this kind of experience. According to the "FREE" study, about thirteen 
percent of contactees say that they have piloted a UFO. Researcher Grant Cameron has written a 
book (Sky Pilots) profiling dozens of cases!

In January of 1973, fourteen-year-old Dolly Safran had a missing time encounter with a UFO over 
her home in the Florida Everglades. This was not Dolly’s first encounter; this had happened many 
times before. But this time was different. After the encounter, Dolly sat down and meditated and 
was able to fully recall what happened. And what Dolly remembered astonished her. She had been 
taken onboard the craft and was given the opportunity to work directly with the ETs. Dolly 
agreed, and the ETs asked her what she would like to learn. Dolly asked if she could learn how 
to pilot the UFO craft. The ETs agreed. So began Dolly’s experiences as a UFO pilot. She began 
having fully conscious encounters where she was taken onboard and trained how to fly the UFO. 
The craft is an alive creature embodied by a fifth-dimensional entity that Dolly calls “Tlera.”

Dolly first had to be tested, physically, neurologically and especially psychically. After that, 
she was taught all about the gravitational and magnetic field lines of planets and how the aliens 
harness the energy of a planet to maneuver their craft. Dolly then sat with the grays and went 
through their flight school, watching and learning all the procedures and processes involved 
with piloting UFOs. 

After five years of intensive training, Dolly was finally ready for her first flight. She sat 
down in the pilot seat, joined psychically with the craft (which is itself an alive entity) and 
traveled to another planet beyond our own solar system. Says Dolly, “You can actually feel 
yourself becoming weightless. You’re magnetically charged. Your body becomes somewhat 
weightless. That’s what it feels like. You’re not constrained by anything. You become part of 
the thing that you’re in.”

Flying the craft is done without any instrumentation. They are all driven psychically. “Learning 
to fly is the same no matter what kind of craft you’re in,” Dolly explains. “Navigation on a 
craft is a little bit different, depending on where you are and what you’re doing. If you’re in 
the atmosphere of a planet, you’re going to fly different if you’re going to travel over a 
dimensional shift. So different applications of the flying occur at those times. If I’m 
dimensionally shifting, I’m using hard telepathy, all telepathy. I don’t guide the ship 
manually in any way. It’s all telepathy. I’m becoming a partner mentally with the craft, 
with the engines of the craft and with the systems of the craft.”

Dolly learned how to fly the craft interstellar distances to virtually any point in the universe. 
This is done through a process the ETs call opening a “light gate.” This allows them to traverse 
vast distances in a matter of seconds. “A giant flash of light opens up,” Dolly says. “One of 
the reasons we can’t see out is because it’s so brilliant it would probably blind all of us, 
including Tlera. Because he has sight sensors. So, we’re protected from it. But there’s a 
brilliant flash of white light around us. And we go through it. We actually jump and go 
through the light. And when we do, we are no longer in this dimension. We’re not in any other 
dimension. We are in the in-between place. We are in a doorway, and it’s instantaneous. It 
happens within a split second. I can feel a shift, and so can Tlera, and so can everyone else 
onboard that ship. You feel it, you know it just happens. It rips right through you. It’s like 
-- you know when an elevator’s coming down, and you’ve got that jump, that weird gee force? 
That’s what it feels like. Because it can disorient you. There’s a lot of electromagnetic 
energy all around you. And it happens that fast.”

Dolly’s experiences with piloting a craft are among the most extensive on record. She reports 
traveling all over the Earth, across the solar system and to many distant parts of the Milky 
Way Galaxy and beyond. She has had fun joy rides, very serious missions, close-calls almost 
resulting in accidents and much more. In this video, Dolly talks about her lifelong experiences 
working and living with the ETs and piloting their craft for various missions. Dolly is able to 
explain exactly how the UFOs fly and what their agenda is on this planet.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal. 
As you can see I've got a very special episode. Today we're doing another 
interview with Dolly Saffron. The subject of my book, "Symmetry A True UFO Adventure". We've already 
done a number of really interesting interviews. Five in fact. Where we've talked about how her 
experiences began as a little girl in Florida. In the Everglades. Where she had a lot of contact 
moving all the way up to age 14 where she had her first fully conscious onboard experience. 
And we've talked about the different types of ET's. She's seen the photographic evidence. She's 
gone to some of the places. The worlds that she's visited. We've covered quite a bit in 
his previous five interviews but this is number six. And I call this one interview with a fully 
conscious, "UFO Contactee Part Six: Flight School". That's right we're going to be talking about 
how dolly was given the opportunity to learn how to fly these craft and her experiences 
with being tested with that trained with that learning how to do it the first time and some 
of The Many Adventures she's had with this as you may know if you've looked into some of my other 
YouTube episodes or read some of my books this is not unique people are taught how to fly these 
craft but Dolly's experiences with this are really extensive certainly the most extensive and detail 
that I've ever had the opportunity to hear about so we're just going to do a deep dive into that 
and we're going to learn some new stuff that's not in the book because that always happens every time 
I talk to you Dolly so first of all let me just introduce you this is Dolly saffron thanks so much 
for coming onto the show again welcome I'm glad to be here thank you for the opportunity hey the uh 
honor is mine yeah I'm excited Dolly because yeah your experiences with all of this are so amazing 
and I have heard it before but not to the detail that you've provided so I thought we would just 
start with you know your experience at age 14 1973 I think it was yes and uh they asked you you know 
how do you want to work with us is there anything you're particularly interested in and you said yes I would love to learn how to fly these craft not really even expecting that they would say yes 
uh so uh I thought we'd just start there and yeah have you describe you know what 
that was like when they said yes and how they tested you because we did go into a little bit 
in the book it wasn't just yes you know sit in the seat let's do it uh it was a whole involved 
process of learning you know first of all seeing if you or even qualified I guess or um have the 
yeah the capability to do it so yeah how did that unfold when you they said 
after that and yeah after that initial session with them they gave me about two weeks uh to 
prepare myself because it wasn't going to be an ordinary contact I was going to be physically 
checked out physically and mentally and uh so the next time I was on board I was given 
um several physicals and mental checkups and they were looking basically at my uh the Neurology 
of my brain uh whether my synapse were in good condition and if I was wired well to my own body 
my own body plays a significant role in this how I react to things what my reflexes are capable of 
doing and how much I'm capable of the handling in an experience that could potentially be critical 
and how I would react to that my body they wanted to know that I was physically fit enough to endure 
what I was about to learn and they checked everything on my heart my lungs my muscles 
my everything all of it this took them about two three weeks oh wow and at the end of that 
um I was brought back up and sat down and it was explained to me that I did meet the 
their standards and then the next set of tests were basically psychic after that they needed to know how well developed I was how much they were going to be investing in uh 
teaching me to employ fully employ my abilities and work with another psychically to link up 
with and whether I was compatible with this entity or not and that would have been too long um it's a lot of being the ship okay it's a natural entity yes
extensive work that they did with me and I had for a good time before we moved beyond that 
um can we dive a little deeper into that because here's a question I have you know they're talking to you psychically telepathically the whole time right there's a lot of that sort of stuff going on 
when you're on board would you say your abilities are more in tune or more how would I put it 
enhanced when you're on Craft as opposed to being here on Earth your are you activating it more are 
you using it more you know not an enhancement as much as as it is that I am psychic I can't 
hear them and they pretty much uh take over the conversation they they're they're psychically 
coming onto me and hearing what I have to say I'm not summarily broadcasting fully to them yet and 
they wanted to see how well I was able to employ myself my own abilities so that they heard me on 
my own and uh there was a little bit of work that I had to do with that I was already broadcasting so that they could hear me but it wasn't as quick or um the communication level has to be even in 
other words I had to learn language I had to learn Uh custom I had to learn uh how they react 
to things it's a mutual two-way street and that I had to become one in communion with them and that 
took a little bit of work that was one of the first things that they taught me in my training was to bring that level of my understanding them up and once I reached that and I was comfortable 
with them then then the next phase of training began and that would be linking with tawada 
when I okay linking with tolada and uh required my ability to remote view there's a second level 
of remote viewing that most people don't realize that they're capable of doing and that is I'm able 
to remote View to a source a space and enjoying with talada in that space it's an electromagnetic 
field and we literally allow ourselves to enjoin mentally and I become him and he becomes me and 
um even though my body is autonomously still operating on its own me I'm enjoined with him 
and what happens to me when that happens is I feel what he feels I see what he sees and when he's in 
craft and dwelling and craft with me that way I become the craft with him I can feel it breathe 
I can feel it move I can feel what's outside of it my eyesight no longer operates independently 
through my own eyes I see through his eyes and the craft systems eyes I feel with the system 
all of it that's why the craft is basically an uh an organic entity itself because it has to 
neurologically join up with the entity Operator just like I'm enjoying my body and my brain to 
and operate this entity here in my physical being I become that with him on Craft right this makes 
sense to me because this is exactly what Julia that's a pseudonym told me oh gosh I think I 
wrote about her book and or her story in my book wondrous uh there was a chapter in there about 
her which was called a grayling named sen and she said when she hooked up telepathically with him 
he was in his ship and she could see through his eyes everything he experienced she experienced 
in vice versa and that's when he started doing all these Maneuvers and she said exactly it was 
like she was actually there right into his eyes so that would be an advanced form of remote viewing 
I guess or linking up blinking yes remote to link yes and once I achieved that the next phase of my 
was understanding how the craft itself is built and works and operates what's going on on that 
craft physically as well as mentally and how it operates and I had to learn a lot of math I 
had a lot of physics I had to learn what uh the type of fusion that they were using to 
um use this element that they burned to create a graviton wave and once I understood that that's 
part of what's happening to me while I'm in with Pilates I can feel that all working colada has 
total control over the energy of the craft I have control over where we're going and 
directional and I help open light Gates it takes the two of us together to open a light gate 
um so the next thing I learned after that was the craft itself and how it operates and then once 
we got that I was on board with him and I learned the basics of movement in the craft I had to learn 
Direction I had to learn speeds uh how to maneuver how I physically was enjoined in this craft and 
it became an extension of my mental body and I was helping to steer it with my own mind I was 
helping to slow it down or lower or raise it or go skiff I was learning what it felt like to have 
electromagnetic fields around me and the fields that were so you know that were surrounding me in 
in Union with the fields that we were encountering when we were in inciting 
a magnetosphere on a planet the electromagnetic guidelines or field lines of that planet how they are and they're all a little bit different 
um yeah yeah they're not all exactly the same uh but you feel them you see them and I learned to 
see um it's almost like a heads up display but it's a lot of showing me in real time the lines 
themselves I can see the energy of them through his eyes because he's more advanced than I am he 
absolutely sees them and uh reacting to them they move suddenly they shift suddenly they rise or 
lower suddenly this is not a fixed system inside this magnetosphere with these guidelines there 
it's like being on the ocean in a boat and you have to learn to Pilot with the movement of these lines and negative or positive storms can change it uh the sun itself can come problems the sun 
can shoot off a flare or incoming uh coronal you know wins can shift them it's like being an entire 
environment that you here don't see hear or smell but we do on craft this way because they're that 
advanced and I'm yeah we're talking a little bit about this in the book where you actually went to 
their planet and learned with some other Pilots as well yes in a classroom environment where 
they went over and over and over yes different scenarios yes different ways magnetic fields 
and gravitational lines and all the stuff works there's a corollary to this Pilots here who are 
surfing the air you know they're flying on on top of the air in a fixed-wing vehicle um it's not the 
same as an electromagnetic environment that I'm in but there is an electromagnetic component to 
a pilot's life in the seat while they're flying this planet they they also have pockets of uh 
dead air they have turbulence everything and they have to join up with that and their their reflexes 
play 100 into that they learn to feel things and see see them and know when things are coming in 
and encompassing them and so there are there are tactics flight tactics so I learned to with these 
students uh when this is happening you do this so when this is happening you drop or when you're losing a guideline you go straight up you get out of there okay you have to have the reflexes to do 
that sometimes people see UFOs dancing around in the sky and they're like what the hell is going on that's what's going on they've got uh a lot happening to them while they're up there and 
if you see them dancing or doing weird things they're not as much putting on a show to you is that they're surfing this and they're having to stay you know uh so this explains this motion that 
we see like yes all around us yes the pendulum movement as well or following exactly we feel 
yeah there's some uh to that there is a um the Earth itself heaves and breeds itself and it it 
can shoot up electromagnetic energy from its core and it'll heave out and you can feel it or it'll 
drop you can feel that as well it's amazing it's very much like being on the ocean very much or in 
the air flying a regular airplane yeah we made an interesting uh point to me once that said we're 
not actually flying in the in the traditional sense uh they don't call it flying is that right
okay anymore I wanted to wonder if you could describe a little bit about the seat you sit 
in because is that seat normally designed for Grays and how does it fit you and I mean you 
drew it I'll picture it it uh talada can alter the seat to fit anybody who sits in a tall short heavy 
whatever and uh it's so what I drew is how I fit the seat what it looks like for me um the first 
time I ever sat down when it was still for a gray and he hadn't changed it yet and they realized oh you got to fix the chair for her it was kind of funny and I was like I don't think this is gonna 
work um I have two pads under my feet and they are to stop me from electromagnetically charging 
uh it's like a fair day cage under my feet I have a field around me and this is a very big craft in 
the smaller craft we almost have a real Faraday cage about us um it's a field and it protects 
us from being electrocuted that means death if you're electrocuted you would die and so 
it stops me from doing that I also wear nothing that will charge I think the suit that I wear is 
text me that and my hair is not down like this I'm it's pulled back very tightly 
um there's a gel that I put in it that helps not conduct electricity or static over me and it's 
either ponytail they give you a gel kind of thing or is that something that's a gel it's a type of 
gel yeah it washes out easy but it protects me from charging they give it to you is my question 
they give you an actual gel to put in or is that something oh oh wow so they give you an actual 
flight suit and a gel that's very interesting all right so uh is the seat comfortable very it's 
um it's I mold into it and it uh will adjust to me as I'm flying like if I 
was to drop suddenly like oh you know come back down I'm held in it somehow you know it 
keeps me connected to it so I don't break contact with it because to do that would 
shoot me with electricity you wouldn't believe so the seat holds on to me uh it doesn't let me go 
um it's so comfortable that if I have a backache one day it'll pop up my uh it'll puff up behind my 
lumbar spine and give me a little lumbar support it nose the craft knows I mean once you're 
connecting mentally up with it it feels what I feel anyway so it's correcting for me all the time 
it's a very good ride it also helps my circulation I don't get um you know I you sit that hard and 
flat on something for a long time you can develop problems in your circulation to your legs and it's 
gauge to help keep me my blood flow to my legs uh going you know I have good circulation 
in the chair oh no this explains me of you know uh partially experience 
where he actually you know left the I guess you called the exam room went on the corridor turned 
One Direction or another I think was right into this other little room which as it got to the center became transparent all around he saw these stars and there was a chair and 
he sat down in it and there was these little knobs and buttons and he started pressing them and the stars were moving around and I'm wondering are there any buttons or knobs 
on the seat that you were in because I would have presented itself to him by the pilot something 
that he was familiar with help him understand to to try it in other words he wasn't mentally 
connecting with the crowd per se but the craft gave him the opportunity to do something that 
felt familiar to him to teach him that he could do these things look out blah blah that kind of thing 
when human beings go on board and they see things like that it's basically the craft accommodating 
them it's not necessary for the craft to operate that way it doesn't really use them but for sure
because when you went on at age 14 and you actually got to fly that first time they gave 
you a little sort of joystick device or a little one it's about that long 
it's about tapers down protect you can
you give a little bit and it connects to my Consciousness with tolada so that I could 
join with him without knowing how and it was really cool all right so after going through 
all this you know learning and then sort of testing uh you actually got to sit down 
next to was it the AI Grays or yeah gray and I had a tall gray with me who was the pilot also 
began the process of actually learning how to employ what I had learned it's like becoming a 
you're going to become a surgeon you have to get in there you know all hand-eye motor coordination 
linking up mentally to put physical use Mental use to what you've just learned and to employ it often 
over and over and over until it becomes a habit you know not even thinking about it and just do 
it without even thinking now and it took a while to do that there's tears in that type of training 
there's kind of two different things going on here when you're firecraft right there's what 
I guess you would call interplanetary Travel yeah outside the magnetosphere at the planet all right 
so is that differentiated from the beginning were you learning both interesting I had to learn both to operate because we mostly train when we travel we like gate between 
that were going and come in were Stellar Interstellar very close to a planet 
or way back out and then we fly in and then you have to transition into their magnetosphere and 
into their atmosphere and it takes a little bit of doing how to do that because we're changing the way the ship is operating we're going from a nuclear
needed energy source to battery after that once we come into magnetosphere we change over the 
batteries because it's too hot you can take what we are driving with in on you it's too hot we're 
talking over 7000 degrees outside the craft alone or anything and it's so bright you couldn't look 
at a burn across here all right so are you hearing any noise when this is all going on
you're outside the ship with colada so yes I can hear density we don't really fly we 
don't have a we don't react to the air mass that we're in do nothing because I can hear 
things operating around me that are coming in at us on frequency level that are electronic 
from this planet it's incredible this is a very chatty place there's a lot going on here and we 
can actually hear it this is coming off this planet and clicking chirping uh that kind of 
thing over here TV sometimes we hear all kinds of things music it's just because I'm where we're at 
what we're doing and a lot is going to allow I mean unwise into signals that I'm hearing 
okay so when you're flying over a planet do you have like displays that show like the magnetic 
fields or you know what I mean a little the temperatures mental heads up display that comes 
down before me mentally that that is projecting to me and I can see every satellite in the sky coming 
down here I can see debris I can see birds flying in your atmosphere I can see whales swimming in 
the sea there are different levels of density that I'm looking at and we avoid coming in contact 
with those as we fly it's a very very populated place here and we have to be careful how we'll 
come through not in the business of destroying the technology that belongs to somebody else so 
it's a it's a concentrated effort to come down safely that's another reason you see a zigzag 
and many reasons why they do it because they're avoiding objects as they come in oh wow so did a 
lot of your training take place here in Earth's atmosphere or other places as well since I got 
good at it it's definitely you're doing trained here as well yes okay so you're sitting next to these this great these Grays I guess the top would you say medium gray and AI gray yeah Grace 
in a tall way right all right and but they're the ones who are actually in the pilot seat at this 
point and and you're just linking up with them at the beginning once I became proficient at flying
uh stupid he can control the craft that well and so they allowed me to eat watched me watch dark 
me through the whole thing made mistakes during my training I have learned the hard way a few times 
uh not to the point that I crashed across anybody any problems but yeah I've had a few close calls 
they taught me a great deal don't do that again pay attention don't lose con you know don't lose 
uh Focus the accused of being a very serious person all the time and that's the training 
that I've had I can be very very single-mindedly point I won't let you along with it and that's 
my training at work I can't help myself that's the way I am and it's taught to me 
so you know this went on from age 14 up to age 19 before you actually got to sit down and do 
it yourself I own that's correct yes can you describe that first time in what it was like because you said there's an energy ball you know people talk about the little purse that you see in 
the Anunnaki carrying it was part of my training and all that so it's all connected to that 
The Source where I connect with talata it's an electromagnetic
definition it stands it's about this big it's more than a baseball 
it looks metal although I'm not positive 100 what kind of metals are employed in it 
but it's electromagnetic it has a power source in its seed and when I initialize it I have a 
in my hand um I've been turned on and it led to life when you see those hair glyphs and 
you see the watch with the Daisy in it you know or whatever it is they've got that's their key oh mine was implanted and uh looks stupid walking around with a watch like that 
all the time so mine was implanted in my hand they decided it was better off in my hand and 
um do is have a purse just like the ones that you see on the pilot and I open my purse it 
doesn't exactly look like that that's a beautiful representation of it mine's a little bit more 
sick than that and they open it up and I take the ball out with my hand this hand 
while it's in my hand I make the connection to it I hold it across my chest too little 
there's a arm that comes up on the other side with an electromagnetic hook 
and once I initialize the ball it leaves my hand on its on it exactly jumps up and then 
it expands and expands and then it'll gone up to that hook to hold it it's about this far 
from the hook at all times but it's there and it's a it's a space on like for magnetic field 
space where I now remote view to it I go into it I put more Consciousness into that ball a lot is 
already there waiting for me and that's how we fly outside the magnetosphere I don't need it in 
in our space here but I need it outside essentially to light gate that is a magnifier 
of energy into one of my book use it together to light gate to go to different places all right 
so can you describe more about what a like it is because you know people use terms like wormholes 
and portals and that's I think in essence what they're trying to describe is more what 
you're talking about light gate but uh you know we're hoping so you spent her not within humans 
sorry I can't perceiving them they're so high up in the frequency down course so low 
uh you couldn't even know how to use them they're unknown to humanity because you're not using your 
abilities you can't see or hear them number one and then the second one is you have to 
be very very advanced know what it sounds like and to generate it in your own brain 
it took me a long time to learn how to do that talata brought me through it first it is assumed 
that I couldn't even describe to you it is a frequency that is unbelievable and I mean about 
probably a year or more is that correct exactly correct because it's a very specific frequency 
that we generate together and it literally opens a dimensional route opening between dimensions 
and then we engage I know the coordinates I'm going to go through this with as to wherever 
it is we're going and I employ that ability as well I am the keeper and the gate shutter 
and open the gate with tolada and then once we're on the other side of it I let go and it shuts 
I'm in a long line of other craft and we're all going through one together we all employ our abilities together because it has to be much bigger and the last person through shuts the gate 
we're trying to do that as well it is very fast it's a milliseconds through hold our 
breath when we get there because there is no air we become inter-dimensional once we employ it we 
are already out of this Dimension as we create this thing and we're interdimensional as well 
we're non-dimensional we're outside of everything once we get through and then wherever we end up we
themselves back because we're always in the third dimension when we travel we get to where we're going everything I everywhere I go in this universe is in the third dimension 
all right so here let me just see if I have this correct so what basically the light gate is a process of generating huge amounts of electricity to a point that it opens up into it
okay so is this going into like the fourth or fifth or sixth or is this beyond that 
go through the Fifth Dimension that's why tallade is so substantially aware for us and why they 
help us is their technology that in this Dimension who was able to learn it is the fifth dimensional 
frequency that we use and we go right through to it uh it's it's too fast and it's it's very
been taken to mention like
a handful of times in my life and Donna first time I went to I had to hold me up because I 
see everything in that Dimension you see everything in that Dimension I can see through to the third dimension from The Fifth Dimension and when you can't even explain it 
made me it's like the first experience on Craft I wanted a computer you're stopping me um and I 
only stayed there for about three minutes that's all I could take and they brought me back out 
um me an opportunity a few times after that to train to go into it because they felt like if I 
did that I would take the jump through the light gate much better than I did because I had first started experiencing really really weird symptoms of going through that legate I would puke I get 
dizzy I almost want to pass out and they had to get me past it so they were bringing me into Fifth Dimension to get me used to what it's like well that's what I was going to say so what exactly 
does it feel like when you you know because you're there in the craft and it's all third dimensional but then the gate opens up and you go through it and you come back out what does that feel like 
does it feel like you lose all cohesion with your physical right up it my molecules like um
you know it's there you see it but it's longer physical you become light
so you can travel any distance through a light gate because we can go any distance it one of 
the things I had to learn was coordinates in where I am I'm an idetic memory I'm one of 
my talents in life said I remember everywhere I've ever gone I never get lost I employ that 
and learning where I'm going to go somewhere I have to I've already been there to know where 
it is so part of the training is another or a pilot to chew them teaches you where that 
is and then you jump with them a couple times and then you got it and it's in your mind and you know 
this is critical is without the ability to do that you can't call it a craft
come on everywhere I go and I have is that I'm absolutely top where they are I can go at any time 
underlies how truly integrated you know travel and 
these crafts themselves technologically speaking are with psychic abilities and 
other dimensions I guess is a way of putting it so the craft themselves are partly I think 
you mentioned this once if I remember correctly partly built in other dimensional ways especially
when they exists here and they're trying to make it now and they're never going to make it it's 
it's to be in that Dimension and then they ship it in with the craft time okay so another um point I kind of wanted to go over was when Science Fiction it's all about 
faster than light travel and if you know your science and you know your physics it's absolutely 
really impossible to go speed of light because the faster you go the more your mass increases
so you're not traveling at the speed of light by any means right going through a 
light gate that takes a millisecond to get me from one space to another it's described here 
I'm fine Representatives folding space okay we're going away from here to here 
it's folding space and you can get the gate really close this way get through so you've gone this as many miles in a millisecond and 
you generate the light the light already knows it's there it's all part of everything and you 
land there okay you know what I have to describe that what I'd really like to do is read a short 
quote to you from this gentleman I interviewed I'm using a pseudonym his name is Carter I have not 
publicly revealed his story yet it's coming in a forthcoming book but he started talking about this 
experience he had uh it actually was on Hawaii where he was with his wife off grid in a cabin 
and the whole cabin filled with white light twice actually they woke up sometime later I think 
having had missing time he had a mark on his left arm she had one on her right both in the same spot 
and she he's like did you have any memories what happened she's like well yeah I remember being in this weird craft and I think I saw gray and so forth and he remembered something really 
interesting as well and this is what I'd like to quote it's just about a minute long but it reminds 
me Dolly so much of how you described becoming one with a craft and how they're flown psychically 
because that's what it sounds like happened to him and I'll just quote him here as he says this 
whole thing just unfolded in my head I'm hoping you can quote on this or you know comment on this 
this whole thing just unfolded in my head I was like almost a specialist kind of pilot and I my 
Consciousness had been put into this UFO type of machine my Consciousness this machine was so 
sophisticated it was like a living nervous system that needs a living Consciousness to operate it 
just like our physical body I was test piloting some kind of new system it was like I was immersed 
in it I was inside I was the Consciousness inside the living wiring of this thing it 
was very complex as complex as a body just look at all the systems in the body and the layers of 
complexity for digestion circulation and so forth was like that but when I think of it it was like 
it was all golden it was like everything was made of gold filaments everything was golden and clean 
and super precise and yet living it had a living Dynamic to it it was super responsive to your 
Consciousness whatever I was thinking so yeah he had the feeling like he was learning how to Pilot 
these craft and how he described it reminded me so much of what you're saying that it's not only 
like a living system but you're psychically joined to it to a degree where you you 
almost lose your own well not lose but join with the awareness of The Craft 
so does that sound familiar to you what he's saying absolutely yes
so what do you think about his description of it being like all gold filaments and super clean and 
precise absolutely he's precise that's right everything lights up in uh the golden color
much the perception you get in it it's golden right wow that's very cool so 
you did this the first time how how did you feel afterwards exhausting it Adam
realize that the um gravity I was doing in that moment 
was not something I was going to play it was reality to me yes I said the gravity of it was 
all-encompassing and it sat me down emotionally and down for a few days I was immensely
kind of describe it it's uh to write through your own chest you know right where you live and 
um I think thankfully that moment on what I was doing it compelled me to 
not screw up after that that's how serious it was that's how emotional 
it was that's how unbelievably cool it was and it made me realize that I'm this big
you know and I was like Namaste okay you know we're good and it's amazing our teenager learning 
all this stuff well you're 19 pretty much an adult but still a teenager and there were other 
people you had learned with as well you made an interesting comment that most of them were woman 
is that right women women brings women put it correctly the female physiological mind 
more flexibly good she's feeling and doing in her body 
the hormone axis the chemicals that we produce that sort of thing makes us physically quicker 
Minar that's only one aspect of it though because we are all consciousness 
and outside of our bodies Our Consciousness is capable of anything you are doing specifically 
good but your brain how you are in this iteration in this life that you're living now is tuned to that so when you're in dwelling in the craft you're thinking with a female 
side the males are thinking with male mindsets and it doesn't matter what I'm doing in this 
laptop I'm still going to be a female if I was to be born again and I went to puddle it again and 
it was a male I would be less likely to get the seat because of that I but there are male Pilots 
sorry absolutely because you can learn anything if you have a mind to do it you can do anything 
and it's a fact all right so after you learn how to do this and you're comfortable to do it you started doing more complex things like flying with other people is that right I mean 
in terms of other terms of Jew first a couple and then you know being part of a fleet right 
yeah getting on board we're um uh many aspects of this I mean we're not just flying outside of 
a craft in our own craft we have to board other craft to travel great distances sometimes or just 
need a break and we'll go on to a large craft to take a break so you have to learn how to get on the ship with them and if there's a lot of us doing it there's a real learning curve there 
you know knock somebody down and you don't want your field to bother their field and think precisely so coming down and on this planet we're dealing with what's in 
the air here and it's not just airplanes and jets the animals that are in the skies
did you ever take any like just fun Joyrides like I just want to do something for fun
um the information give them an idea of what you're doing at like a flight plan 
they give you a time that you schedule it and then you go there are definite set rules I can't display to anybody I have to be stealthy to this planet I 
have to be really stealthy if it's another planet in another system there are planets that are wide 
open and you can just go Joyride in anywhere you want to go sort of like a place go have fun even 
within the sisters but you're time limited to that because when you're outside of magnetosphere your radiation is not your friend it's not a friend to the craft or talata and either and so yeah well 
one guy interviewed Tim from Louisiana described how they took him on board and up to the control 
room as they call it the place of movement and they were describing how they do it and he had the 
impression that these were young kind of teenage Grays if you will that they were still learning 
and they were like let's try this let's try that maneuver and they were having a good time with it absolutely days like that yes I wanted to flex my mind out I wanted to flex my abilities and you can 
only do that by pushing yourself congrat those are the days when it gets a little fun so I want to 
read another really short quote because there was a guy that I interviewed in in this book on board 
UFO experiences Jay Gardner who had an experience very much like yours I think he was 14 or 12 
actually 12. uh when he was taken to the planet Saturn like you described and at one point they 
sat him down in the seat and he had they gave him what he just perceived as a sort of a joystick but 
here's what he says happened I took the controls and accidentally drove the craft right into 
the ground I could see the Rocks we were passing through the rocks and there were all these sparks 
flying dirt and everything and at that point the actual pilot took back control of The Craft 
uh so is that something that can happen can you actually go physically into the ground
different phases of power around this and we're employing different modalities of flight 
and uh and uh we can be esprial in other words non-dimensional we go outside this Dimension we're 
here and we're there at the same time we can't go through things I can go through any building 
go through the planet itself although we don't go deep but we can we can go into the water 
um go sit in the trees if you want to um have you done all these things then
have you um ever like gone like something comforted the ground okay I I managed to not 
do that one thank you but uh yeah I've done some really I'm uh you know you just go up and you're 
there and it's uh mind-blowing because you've seen it when you're doing it and you're thinking that's gonna hurt go right through it yeah I think you described one incident I don't know if this was 
in the book but I heard another guy online talking about how he was taken on board of craft but this 
craft actually came right into the house and visit so next thing he knows he's on board even though 
uh they didn't pull him up and it came into through the house yeah and when 
I was when I was older I was in the house one night it's after my father passed away laying there and I'm thinking you know I've never actually got to see y'all come through the wall 
you know Tyler's laughing at me and uh I said no seriously I want to see you come through the wall and I begged for days and then one night I got the answer uh Thomas said you have an incoming 
okay cool it's not a white light that lights you up it's a red light and you see them I 
see them anyway coming in as a red glow and it literally came right through my bedroom about 
put down not the whole crowd shown in the room but the bottom half of it did and it came right through the house real slow laughing the whole way through and I was just like oh my 
God is that what people see and sometimes people do get to see that happen because they're picking them up that way they'll pull you in and they'll go right through your house 
to get you and I've never done that I've never done that that's how I do my pickups it was cool 
as hell yeah they can go through anything yep so when you go like into the water what's that 
like does it do you feel it or is there anything no well you know you're in water in other words 
you know when I'm in the sky I know when I'm in the air and I know when I'm close to the ground and I know if I can you know going through the Treetops or whatever perceive it water 
is different because you go you almost want to hold your breath when you're going in because you think because you can see the water you're going into the water I don't feel a splash I don't 
feel the the barrier of the water it's just air to me I'm going through it and um we go down to 
a depth and we will sometimes cool off that way so that we can make a physical pickup then pull 
the craft down and it's too dangerous for them to come at us when we're that hot no it's not it's 
kind of cool but we also open blankets underwater most people don't understand that a lot of people 
report I saw a light under my boat everything went up that's the light gating operation hello
have you ever chased the transition to some worlds where their water worlds 
we do Transition from water to water world and I like date water and go through that way
happens a lot I mean I'm sorry that I find is near the Lakes I've gone into the Great Lakes 
quite a few times to one gate yeah so when you're flying like there's 
you know Interstellar travel which is opening a light game boom you're there but then there's interplanetary or over planet and you're surfing the gravitational field lines um so when you're 
doing that there's no buttons or knobs you're just doing connecting mentally psychically 
all right so that's including no transistors no there's no what's the word I want to use 
the computers there are no digital anything on watercraft 
if the system is separate because cloud is running them psychically he's part of the craft and he 
doesn't need connections between things he's the whole crop that we're done so no I don't need 
any of that it's all mental all right have you ever chased a car down the road well you're like
I saw because they do that there's always a Third Kind okay when I was young 
young okay this was in what 76 77 it came out I'm still very young then and I got the idea 
looks like fun and this is one of those things that I pushed the gate with it and we were out west no Midwest okay Indiana it was one of those long bodak roads you know 
hardly anybody out there and we saw a car nothing hmm came down and I just sort of followed him for 
a while until he real and I put lights patterns on so I think that was the car first and the guy from us and I was like do I keep up you know so I chased him for low on I went above him and then I 
went in front of them and stopped and he's I mean you spun the car around a little bit trying to 
stop and he's just staring at us and I was like okay enough enough we're going and I left and 
right here you talking about things I silently think about these incidents in my life and 
I'm like waiting to hear that you know somebody describe that so I don't talk about it too often but that is one of the months that I did yeah yeah well this is what I mean when I say I always learn 
something new because you know this is a lifetime of experiences for you it's really impossible to cover in one book it's really why I wanted to do this interview today because there's so much to 
learn about all of this so we've covered a lot I was wondering if you could talk a little bit 
more about some of the close calls you've had or like you know have you ever missed a light gate or have you ever you know dropped you know the gravitational field lines become too wonky I mean 
could you describe some of the more weird close calls you may have had just a couple examples
we were uh daylight and field guideline and then we set the 37th parallel 
that it just went left like by several hundred feet simply and had nothing under me 
if my instinct is to jump power up do a power up you'll see the whole craft will light up 
instantly and I go from Battery straight to nuclear at that point I'm I want my I want my 
ability to use my own gravitational ability to get on there and dropped about six thousand feet 
I was way up there and I just dropped and felt it I physically felt it I was like you know but I 
we got it going then I could hear it too loud in the background going good good good good good catch good catch because it got hit by surprise too this one just shifted all the way to the left 
that secure the only be Jesus out of me okay and I realized oh my God we can crash you know this 
is not a joke if we had hit with no field craft would have busted up it would have been bad and 
people would have been hurt under me that's scared the hell out of me it left a mark in my brain don't do that became uh Ultra aware after that I mean my brain was constantly uh
I didn't like that and it served me well trust me another thing that happened to me is through a 
light gate I ended up going to someone I wasn't supposed to I didn't know I don't know how I messed that up I was young I ended up in summer I wasn't supposed to be and it was a big shock to 
me and then on the other side of that gate and stabilized on it well and to what it was dead 
silent sat there for a few minutes and he said well are we gonna go or not and I was like okay I 
had to recapture myself because I thought how did I make that mistake I got debriefed on that one 
they literally sat me down and said what were you doing what were you thinking they wanted to know every second of what I was thinking to get me to the wrong place and I got worked on a little bit 
with that you know don't do that again that could be bad so yeah that was a big one for me I felt 
like me for a while you know I was berating myself everywhere like it scared me let's see what's 
another dumb stupid thing I'm done come in get ready to juice up in other words light up power up 
you have to bring the batteries up they drop down somewhere that's why you see a bottom part of the 
craft that's sort of like Lord that's the battery packs coming down in the bigger craft and uh
just powered up and and that causes a problem with your field okay if you got something 
sticking out on the craft it can mess with the field somewhere and that caused a wonkiness 
getting out of the atmosphere that was a weird day for me too it's just these are 
just stupid things that happen to you until you learn not to forget to do them all right have you 
ever like knocked out the electronics of someone's house accidentally or something like that yeah
properly the craft has a definite the EMP that the craft produces is
the field of it Clarity on the crafts even more at the South or Easter West whichever way we're turning and 
directing or using the field lines if you're facing something directly facing something the 
NP is in front of you in whatever Direction you're going and when you're incoming you're 
coming down you turn away from it you turn around from it I don't need to see what's in front of me to guide this craft you know components when I was younger I impeding the entire neighborhood
a car on the highway and they're just suddenly going oh my God you know and you worry about them crashing because when the car goes dead and the wheels are moving it goes dead and the wheels 
are moving and they can't you know if you don't have power steering that's great because you can 
but if you have power steering they're kind of screwed so yeah yeah I care about that and yes I 
accidentally knocked power out yep has anyone like tried to photograph you when they weren't allowed 
like that closer I am to you the less likely you're going to get a picture 
we hold out at about three thousand if we're 3 000 feet away from you get really good chance of 
getting us on film anything closer in than 3000 feet you're not going to because your camera your digital camera even the film itself can't handle that radiation and it'll knock it out 
uh it'll stop it dead we know what you're doing we know you've got a camera in your hand and you 
know you're pointing it at us we don't want you to see us we turn to face you so that you can't so 
we allow the MP to just knock it out again yeah this is all really interesting to me because you 
know when you first start talking about piloting The Craft I had heard this before and was really even more confirmation for me certainly when Canadian researcher Grant Cameron 
put out his book Sky Pilots which you know basically presents I think it's more than 
a dozen cases of people who've describe the same sort of experience so would you say this is something that I commonly teach other people how to do or there's more than 
I guarantee is lots of us they want us and they want if you have abilities and they 
single you out for them you have a very high chance of being offered this opportunity and there are plenty of people on this planet who have taken that opportunity I'm not the only one 
do they not have their own Pilots I mean why would they need to teach us or is it is the situation is unique and one of the situations that we're facing here is that 
we're at the end of the cycle and they're going to need a lot of craft to pick up a lot of people at the same time better for us a human opens the door the card get on now 
prepped everybody for this they've been sending mental messages to everybody on this planet that they're coming then they will happen will come down and remove Community from the planet 
because it will not be safe here anymore and it's coming to that soon rapidly it's better for you 
not to see grace sitting there going hey how you doing you better if you see me hey how you doing 
time to go and from me beforehand too I mean that's one of the reasons I'm talking 
is I want you to understand that this is we're all being trained to help in our Excursion our 
in our saving ourselves that's an important fact everybody needs to like connect to we're 
just going to come here and do everything for us not and not buy a long shot no they're not they want us to use our abilities they want to listen to what they have to say they want us to mentally 
prepare what's before us and pay attention to the truth because this situation is Israel
yeah so yeah this is ultimately the purpose of why they agreed to teach you is because you know there 
is a purpose behind all this it's not just fun and games absolutely you know it's not why me and nobody else it's um I'm one of a lot of people here that have disability and are working it 
all right so I want to begin to wrap this up because we've been talking almost an hour now 
and I want to give you the opportunity to sort of you know give what the et's message is to all of us and how important I think it's you know basically having to do 
with the development of our psychic abilities to help overcome what we're facing but yeah I mean however you want to wrap this up I want to give you that opportunity because 
this is a big part of your experiences is flying craft you know scooping up people to 
examine and heal them and guide them and counsel them and so forth but uh yeah I mean what is the 
et's message to because I believe you wanted to sort of close with that Humanity has seen
yes things are going to be difficult is there going to be explosive in front of 
us and cataclysmic in front of us we're we're awesome people like them we are the children and 
we have a lot of ability you know and innately we know it we're good um but you have to choose 
for yourself where you're going to go with this and it's important to think about it critically 
this side for yourself everybody each one of you in either no I'm just gonna stay as I am 
copacetic whatever happens or you can embrace dance make this leap to make this journey within 
learn with love and you have to do a little bit of work yourself beforehand it's not hard to do 
you just have to decide to do it first decision in that and the very first decision you must do 
learn to decorate yourself what's going on in this world because right now it's 
a jingle on the surface outright wine fantasy that is not real happy joyful 
and knowing that you have an opportunity before you to do great things for yourself 
yourself of whatever woes this world is performing here because you're gonna go on a journey if you 
so too that's the message it's time what your mind which way you want to go really 
think it through take a day sit down man let the universe talk to you let ET talk to you listen 
to what they're saying oh yeah well that's really encouraging actually this is a message I've heard 
about other contactees certainly have told me this sort of thing about the Sky filling with 
craft on warnings of you know hard times ahead and all the stuff that you're saying is certainly 
familiar to me but it's really wonderful to hear in such detail and such positive terms 
that's just it's just really cool and really remarkable that we have these people out there 
who are working so hard to help us through this transition and I think it's important that people 
know and like you say try to sift through all the lies of the disinformation the false narratives 
our governments are putting forth and look to the truth look to science look to your own experience 
and this is something that's available to anyone right and anyone can reach out to these guys
very cool anything else you want to add just happy joyful 
days in front of you to work for yourselves and your families and
pain Consciousness regain the ability to reach and tap your own Consciousness and then hear 
others as well it's a beautiful thing to do and it's fun very slow I can't tell you how 
much fun this was for me all of it I can only imagine I mean wow it's fun driving 
a car so to say my other car is a UFO that's a bumper sticker I've seen is and have it be true
it's just really amazing so yeah thanks dolly that was awesome and I definitely learned some stuff 
and it was certainly really interesting and we did Cover part of this in the book symmetry A true UFO 
Adventure so if y'all want to read more about Dolly's experiences definitely check out that 
book but yeah Dolly huge thanks to you I really appreciate you coming on to the show very much
all right that's the show for tonight guys thanks very much for watching I truly appreciate it and 
as I always like to say keep searching for answers keep looking for the truth and most importantly 
keep having fun right Dolly absolutely all right bye guys
