OUT OF BODY EXPLORING: MY OWN EXPERIENCES WITH ASTRAL PROJECTION
Jul 11, 2021

Summary:
Jul 11, 2021
In 1984, following the unexpected death of my mother from a heart-attack, I began having unusual experiences. First I saw her spirit appear to me as an apparition. Then I started having lucid dream-like encounters during which she would visit me in my bedroom. Then I started having out-of-body experiences.

Astral projection experiences have been reported for thousands of years, but I had no idea that anyone could have them. After working hard to learn how to have out-of-body experiences, I began to leave my body, explore the physical world, fly and walk through walls and more. I soon began to travel to the Other Side and had a wide variety of incredible experiences such as: meeting my mother and taking a tour of the heavenly realms, meeting with spirit guides, learning about past lives, basking in "the Light," learning in the Akashic Library, rescuing lost souls, and so much more. 

This video is the story of how I learned how to leave my body, and the wonderful experiences I had on Earth and in the many higher dimensions on the Other Side. I also present methods that anyone can use to have their own out-of-body experiences.

Is astral travel dangerous? What are the obstacles? Can anyone do it? What are the benefits? What kind of experiences can you have? What happens when you leave your body and travel into other dimensions. This video answers all these questions and more! Would you like to have an out-of-body experience? Are you willing to at least try?

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Welcome to another episode of UFO's in the paranormal.
I have something a little different for you today. Today I'm going to be talking about my 
own experiences. Specifically, my own experiences with astral travel and out-of-body exploring. 
So, todays episode is called "Out-of-Body: Exploring My Own Experiences". This is something that's very 
dear to me. Something I've really worked hard to do. I've talked about this quite a bit 
on various radio shows and podcasts. But this is the first video I've put together. 
A number of you have requested that I do this. So, I am just going go ahead and do it. 
so before I get into the actual experiences let me give you a little bit of background about how this all rolled out for me uh as you may know I started out a complete skeptic 
in ufos and anything paranormal and how it began was really on october 13th 1984 
i received a phone call that my mother had passed away of a massive heart attack at age 49. this was 
of course as you can imagine devastating and it was then that strange things began to happen to 
me it's just a few weeks later at the service for my mother that I saw her spirit her ghost 
i did not think that's what was what was happening when it occurred I saw her appear as a full-color 
apparition in front of me and I thought to myself wow I i must be delirious with grief 
i am seeing things I am losing my mind I didn't tell anyone I didn't think ghost or spirit 
i just thought I was hallucinating due to grief I now believe it probably was her spirit 
and that's sort of the first thing that happened and it wasn't long after that throughout 1985 
and 86 and even into 1987 I began having very vivid dreams I've never really been a big dreamer 
but I started having dreams where my mother would come into my bedroom I would wake up and 
look at her in complete shock and say what are you doing here you're dead and she would smile at me 
and sort of telepathically let me know that no she was just fine that everything was all right 
and this happened over and over again uh more than a dozen times for sure 
and I found it really quite confusing because I knew on some level that this was her 
it was the same every time she'd walk in I'd wake up I'd be completely shocked and she would just 
kind of look at me and smile and then I would wake up for real so this was sort of a false awakening 
i didn't realize it at the time but this was probably a lucid dream or a pre-lucid dream 
any rate I really felt like this was her I mean I could just tell by the quality of her presence 
because on the other hand I didn't believe in life after death so I was really conflicted both 
of these things could not be true either I was going crazy or she was really visiting me so I 
wasn't quite sure how to handle this and when it kept happening I started to look for answers I 
read books by carlos castaneda by jane roberts I read books about dreams and I stumbled into 
the subject of lucid dreaming and that's when I thought okay perhaps this is what's happening to 
me I am having lucid dreams so so I started to read more and more books on dreams and tried to 
learn how to become lucid in the dream state how to wake up while in the dream and I did not find 
it easy I kept trying and I couldn't really do it but events marched forward and in 1988 or I'm 
sorry 1986 I had another strange awakening this was on november 17 1986 I was watching the news 
and the newscasters came on and there was a pilot apparently who had seen a ufo over alaska 
i didn't believe it for a second I thought this pilot was lying I thought he was crazy deluded 
misperceiving but I remembered my brother had seen a ufo and I kind of made the mistake of asking him 
what he thought of this pilot and what had he seen and my brother mark described an incredible 
ufo encounter and I knew he wasn't lying and it didn't sound like he was misperceiving 
so I started asking more questions found out a number of people within my family my friends my 
co-workers had seen ufos and uh it was clear to me that there was something going on here so this 
was pretty much earth shaking for me really shattered my world view I had to re-evaluate 
everything I thought I knew ufos were real and it soon became clear that it was more than that 
because a lot of the people I knew who hadn't they were not only seeing ufos but seeing aliens having missing time these were some major encounters and some of them were describing 
ghost encounters as well I thought to myself well that happened to me people I knew had described 
near-death experiences precognition dreams that come true clairvoyance telekinesis levitation 
i thought to myself what's going on here so I started reading more books and had a real 
big adjustment to my world view I started interviewing people and this is when I found a book by robert monroe called journeys out of the body 
robert monroe is well known for out-of-body exploring he's written three best-selling books 
on this subject and his first book described his own experiences and in the end of the book 
it had exercises on how to do it I thought okay this sounds a little peculiar a little bit scary 
but I'm certainly willing to try it it sounds very very interesting if a person can leave their body 
and explore the other side which is what he said perhaps I could find out if there was life after death first hand so I started doing these exercises this is basically meditation 
relaxation exercises visualizations affirmations this sort of thing I'll get more into this in a 
bit uh and to my surprise these exercises worked I immediately started having a lot more dream 
recall started having pre-lucid and lucid dreams for example one dream I woke up to find myself 
on the kitchen floor somehow I'd fallen asleep on the kitchen floor floor and my head was stuck 
under the cabinet and I pulled myself to a standing position and I was very confused 
because I thought to myself how the heck did I fall asleep on the kitchen floor this makes 
no sense and I was very tired very disoriented and I managed to stumble back into my bed 
and as soon as I hit the bed I woke up and realized that this was a dream but I thought 
i was awake so this is sort of a pre-lucid or lucid dream and uh I continued to do the exercises 
that robert monroe outlined in his book and it wasn't long before I had my first full-blown 
out-of-body experience I remember it vividly it was february 7 1988 it was during the day I 
went to lay down in bed for just a few minutes I was a little tired that day and laid down on 
my stomach when suddenly my body felt really heavy and I almost passed out but I didn't I was awake 
but I felt these strong electrical feelings pulsing through my body sort of a vibration 
and robert monroe talks about this he calls it the vibratory state the vibrational state 
and I knew instantly that that was what was happening to me uh he said it would be like 
a mild electric shock and I thought to myself mild I feel like I am being electrocuted and for 
a little while there I thought perhaps I'd stuck my finger into the electric socket next to my bed 
and this went on for a good 30 seconds to a minute when suddenly there was a pronounced sort of pop 
and I felt a swooping sensation and I lifted up out of my body and went across my bedroom 
through the hallway and into the bathroom and I stood in front of the sink grabbed the 
countertop and looked into the mirror and there was nothing there and I became extremely excited 
and I shouted to myself I'm doing it I'm doing it I'm actually doing it I was amazed of course and 
was only conscious for maybe a minute before I was pulled back into my bedroom across the hallway and 
into my bedroom sort of uncontrollably pulled right in back towards my body I was shocked to 
see a short man standing next to my bed and as I kind of floated by him I grabbed him and spun 
him around by the shoulders and tried to look into his face to see who he was and my vision blurred 
and I got pulled horizontally over my body and I plopped back into my body I instantly woke up I 
was so excited I was so happy I had actually done it I mean I could have levitated with glee I was 
really excited and I doubled down on the exercises and it wasn't long before I had another experience 
these would usually happen on weekends when I could sleep late sometimes happen spontaneously in 
the middle of the night and these beginning ones were always very short the second one was pretty 
much the same exact thing I popped out of my body flew across my bedroom across the hallway and into 
the bathroom again and was pulled back into my body the third one was a little scary actually 
i woke up one night and found myself standing next to my bed and I was had a lot of vertigo 
i was pretty disoriented but really dizzy and finally I got my bearings and kind of fully 
woke up and I looked down in bed and I got a real shock I was lying there under the covers and at 
the same time I'm standing next to my bed and I got a real cold chill a feeling of dread swept 
over me and I thought to myself I've died I am dead I am a ghost I was not happy I was actually 
really frightened and I immediately dived back into my body felt a very peculiar sensation of 
filling up my body and kind of wiggling into place and woke up and I almost forgot what happened 
but suddenly it popped back into my mind and I smiled I was really happy I had done it again 
so this was enough for me to become hooked and I really started doing a lot of meditating 
and trying to do this over and over again and I did I i started having regular out-of-body 
experiences often very early in the morning I would feel the vibrations or just suddenly pop 
out of my body and I'd be floating in the middle of my room and I would become so excited so happy 
i get immediately pulled back in I mean literally these were five second out of body experiences and 
finally I learned to extend it to about 20 seconds 30 seconds to a minute this took several months 
and then I had to learn how to move how to see often my vision would be cloudy 
and I had a hard time focusing everything looks a little different when you're out of body but 
by practicing I was able to do that I had to learn how to move initially I would try to flap my arms 
and wiggle my legs and I would just kind of dangle there like a spider in the middle of my room 
and it was really frustrating and confusing and finally I learned how to move was through a matter 
of will power you would just sort of focus on moving and you would whoosh move across the room 
and that's what I did this was pretty much the first year or two of my out-of-body experiences was learning how to calm myself down emotionally learn how to see and learn 
how to move and after I did that this is when the fun really began I started to explore the house 
i would walk through my bedroom door it's a very peculiar sensation 
and explore the living room and when you're out of body everything's really beautiful there's sort of a weird glow everything has a little bit of light coming off of it and it's very peaceful 
very I mean it's very hard to describe it's very calm it's kind of a lonely feeling too 
because there was no one else out there it was just me as near as I could tell I did not have a 
spirit guide that I saw not like those first two times I think that's perhaps what that man was 
but at any rate I sort of learned how to extend it to a minute to two minutes to 10 minutes 
to upwards of an hour and I became more courageous got you know more courage to go outside 
i would run through the back door the glass sliding door uh which is a weird sensation I 
can tell you feel it throughout your whole body it's kind of like diving into water 
sort of you there's surface tension and you pop out on the other side it's really cool actually 
sometimes I would just fly straight up through the ceiling and hover above the house about 50 feet 
100 feet up and start flying around and I can tell you flying is worth the price of admission to this 
it is so much fun so I spent a good year just doing loop-de-loops and flying around the house 
and sort of exploring the backyard I did of course tell my family I was trying to explain to them 
that ufos were real and some of them weren't happy about that because they did not believe 
except for those who had seen it and now I'm telling them that I'm going out of body and 
several of my brothers and sisters and I had a lot I you know I'm one of six kids 
and my father and I was telling them I'm having out-of-body experiences 
and they were looking at me like I was crazy and I'm like no no for real honest to god I am and uh 
they just kind of shrugged and said okay you know that that's nice okay 
i couldn't convince him uh and my experiences continued I started to explore the physical world 
more and more I would kind of float down our road our street there down the driveway fly around 
super beautiful it's a lot of fun and at one point I got the courage to go farther and do more and 
more stuff for example we have telephone wires near our house I would always fly around them but 
i had read other books on astral travel by this time I was buying all the books and several astral 
travelers said you go ahead fly right through them you can't be hurt you're out of body you're not 
physical nothing can hurt you and so I finally got the courage and I flew right through the telephone 
wires it was a little scary but there was a blast of light a little buzzing feeling buzzing noise 
and I was out on the other side since then I've done it many times and I usually feel nothing 
sometimes I'll be flying to get out through the ceiling or the wall and I'll bounce right off of it that's always a surprise uh sometimes you barely can squeeze through it 
and you almost get trapped and sometimes you just slide right through it easily sort of depends I think on your level of awareness or the density of your astral body 
so I did this sort of thing for quite a while 1991 my first thought about experience I was let's see 
22 years old pretty young man I moved out of the house when I was 25 to a condominium complex in 
canoga park and that's where I continued my explorations mainly of the physical world 
sometimes I would call out for my mom and see if she would come and she never did but 
there were a few times where I popped out of body and to my utter shock there she was 
and I would run up and hug her and uh was would be overjoyed to see her 
she never really said much at least I couldn't remember it sometimes she did talk but I would 
forget what she said when I woke up but what would often happen is I would see her and I would 
remember being with her on a nearly nightly basis all these memories would come flooding back to me 
it was really quite confusing because I felt like I was living in two worlds 
we it's hard to describe but I would come back to my body and I would forget all of that 
memory I would remember remembering if that makes any sense but the actual details would 
escape me until I got out of body again and then all these memories would come flooding back and I 
would think to myself well I must be a mistake and my mom's alive and this is where I live 
until I would pop back in my physical body and I'd have to readjust again so in the beginning it was 
really quite confusing and somewhat dreamlike and I wondered I started to wonder perhaps these are 
dreams perhaps I am going crazy I knew I wasn't because there was a lot of books on this and 
what I was experiencing matched what other people were writing about but what happens to you it is 
a little disconcerting so I tried moving objects I never could I would fly over to my friend's houses 
uh to you know other family members homes and try to get their attention they could never see me 
i was an absolute ghost so it was really quite frustrating I couldn't move objects I couldn't 
get anyone's attention but I devoured it that I was going to get proof that this was real 
and one day I was out of body early one morning and I'm flying around 
behind my condo uh where there's sort of a cement river the la river 
totally encased in cement and I'm flying along it when I see this weird patch of soil on the ground 
i thought well this is a hallucination this has got to be at least partly a projection or a dream 
because the river is completely composed of cement and what I was looking at was a huge 
patch of soil with grass growing on it I saw seven up cans some water bottles and I 
thought well I know what I'm going to do I know exactly where this is it's not far from my house 
i'm going to fly back into my body and I'm going to go over here and check it out in real life 
so that's what I did I flew back into my body and I woke up wrote the experience down 
got a strong cup of coffee and vowed to drive over there I could have walked but it would have taken too long so I took my car and drove over to this section of the la river 
and uh climbed down to the edge and looked down and got a real shock 
there it was exactly as I had seen it in the out of body state and I can tell you that's a peculiar 
feeling seeing something that you've first seen out of body in a location that you haven't seen 
before and then looking at it physically and yeah I proved to myself that this was in fact 
real so from that point I started doing more exploring of the physical world I would fly 
over canoga park in southern california I'd fly over the freeways I'd go thousands of feet up it 
was scary sometimes because I thought well what if I fall but kept reminding myself I'm out of body 
uh you can't be hurt and I would fly farther and farther away I flew all the way to a 
friend's house in san diego that was all kinds of fun normally when you're flying around it's 
maybe 5 or 10 20 miles per hour but if you reach for a farther destination something weird happens 
you sort of teleport and boom you're there and uh I was at my friend's house and I tried to 
get his attention I couldn't so I just kind of flew around his neighborhood there and I 
think it was ocean beach in san diego and I couldn't get anyone else's attention either 
once I was staying at his house I flew all the way back to my condominium so yes you can travel far distances and I did a lot of exploring of the physical world initially 
one thing I read about from robert monroe was that he visited the moon uh he and some of his uh 
friends I guess or the people he's taught how to do it his students and uh they said that there's nothing there but craters and dust I wasn't 
so sure because you know I had been reading about ufos and possible artifacts on the moon 
so I just you know that was on my bucket list for sure and one evening I woke up spontaneously I was 
already out of body that's how it sometimes happens and I was flying upwards around my 
condominium and I looked up and there was the moon it was a full moon and I said oh all right 
let's go to the moon and I did I said okay take me to the moon let's go and I sort of focused on it 
and it was taken a long time at this point I could stay conscious maybe five ten fifteen minutes and the rate I was going I knew I would not make it there unless I sped up 
so I really really focused on getting there and suddenly zoom I was it's 
going much faster there was a shift and I was suddenly I was there it filled up my whole 
field of view and I came in for a landing and I was stood on the moon and I thought to myself 
all right um this is amazing I mean I'm always thrilled whenever I make it out of body it's 
truly exciting and I thought to myself well no one's ever going to believe this 
and I didn't tell anyone because it was just too wild and who would believe this 
but there I was on the moon looking at the craters and the dust and it was very gray with sort of 
tones of white and gray and I'm flying around a little bit just exploring and looks pretty much 
just like you know you would think the moon is not much there uh really beautiful starkly beautiful 
and then something caught my attention there was a little sort of hill ahead of me 
and to my surprise a section of this hill had a little dome in it sort of on the edge there and 
it was perfectly smooth I could instantly see this was artificial it was made out of the same stuff 
or apparently it looked like the same sort of moon rock stuff but it was very obviously artificial 
it was way too smooth so I made a beeline for it and went right inside and it was rather large 
and hollow and there was a room inside sort of long-ish and there was a lot of laboratory 
equipment a lot of highly technological equipment there was rows of this equipment and tables 
and my vision started to go in and out a little bit but I looked up I came up to one of the tables 
and I saw that there was a person lying on it what looked like a young man maybe a child 
and I tried focusing on them and I got a real shock because what I saw was 
not good what I saw was it looked like there was some sort of genetic experiment going on 
and that there was sort of like he was part animal part human so this did not make me happy 
i became really upset and I tried to destroy the place sometimes when you're out of body you can 
you feel like you're opening doors or moving objects but you're not you're actually moving sort of the astral duplicate like I'll run to my front door and I'll open it 
and then of course when you wake up the next morning the door is not opened so there's a astral 
duplicate of the physical world uh is what I found out from reading and firsthand experimentation 
so that's what I was doing I started destroying what I could and that eventually woke me up 
so yeah you can explore the physical world and it's all kinds of fun but at some point 
you do get drawn to the other side because that is the astral body's natural habitat 
in effect you're not really astral projecting you're projecting when you're in your physical 
body because your real home is on the other side that soon became clear to me and the astral body 
is also called the desire body or the emotional body and once you go out of your body you'll find 
out why because your emotions are much stronger when you're out of body there is no filters
and your emotions will hit you like a ton of bricks any emotion that you've suppressed whether it's fear or anger or lust or 
you know the deadly sins all of these anything you've suppressed will come roaring out in full 
force and I got over the fear barrier pretty quickly I had a lot more trouble with you know 
being too excited overly excited but once I started popping over to the other side uh 
emotions would get the better of me and I had a lot of trouble with anger uh with gluttony 
and with lust so I want to talk a little bit about lucid dreaming versus the out-of-body experience 
there's a lot of discussion in this in the out of body literature and some people think 
they are completely separate phenomena some think that they're related something to the same thing 
i think they are essentially the same thing uh because when you are lucid dreaming you 
are out of body the only real difference is when you're lucid dreaming you're perceiving 
the environment around you as being a mental projection a hallucination and when you're out 
of body you're perceiving what you would call the real world or the astral equivalent of it 
so essentially they are the same thing but it's sort of a different state of awareness I've had a number of lucid dreams where I've walked through a wall and popped out into an out of 
body experience so you can project from the lucid dream into an out-of-body experience and I've had 
out-of-body experiences where I fall back into a lucid dream and there are some which are so 
similar it's difficult to tell the difference but at any rate what often happens is when you 
try to get to the other side you will go into this area which robert monroe called locale 2. and this 
is where thought rules thought rules the astral plane what you think will appear in full color 
so you have to be really careful with your thoughts and what you're thinking and what you're feeling because it will manifest and for me my first real problem was 
anger I'm not really an angry person I didn't think I was but definitely I had some issues with 
this apparently and for me how it would manifest was I would find myself in a grocery store 
and this isn't unusual this is something many astral travelers will tell you that they find 
themselves inside grocery stores for whatever reason this is a thing I think perhaps it's 
because grocery stores have a lot of life force in them with all the food I don't know it's very 
strange and I would find myself in what I perceive to be the local market or the local supermarket 
sometimes it was a completely unknown grocery store at any rate I would go crazy and start 
throwing bottles ripping open packages breaking windows tipping over shelves 
clearing shelves of their items and just basically destroying the place until I somehow got rid of my 
waves of anger not sure where they were coming from but this is what 
i went through and it was a real struggle for a good several months and it wasn't only that 
another thing that would sweep over me was hunger I would become insatiably hungry I think this 
might be tied to past lives where I've starved to death because past lives is a big thing as we'll get to but I would pop out of body find myself in a grocery store and I would start going 
for my favorite foods or I'd pop out find myself on the other side and I just manifest a table 
filled with my favorite foods which were usually sour cream and onion potato chips brownies chicken 
pieces neapolitan ice cream these sort of things and I would just gorge I would rip open a carton 
of orange juice and drink the whole thing I'll rip open the bag of potato chips and eat all of them 
it was inhumanly possible to eat this much food and it feels real and it tastes real I mean these 
chips were crunchy and delicious but they would sort of end I mean you could not fill yourself up 
the food would sort of disappear right around your neck kind of that's how I perceived it 
and yeah I would just eat as much chicken as I could or brownies or whatever I could think of 
candy and a lot of it and it uncontrollably so I went through that for some time and never could 
quite appease my appetite but at some point uh just it stopped happening I sort of got through it 
and another real powerful thing they had to get through was lust and this is a bit embarrassing so 
i won't get too into it uh but yeah I would become overcome with feelings of lustful you know sexual 
energy this is definitely a big thing with astral travel many astral travelers will talk about this 
robert monroe went into some depth with this and he said he would always just avoid you know having 
sex sex on the other side and move on uh I did not I wasn't able to do that so I just kind of 
go in and partake and it's all kinds of fun yeah I actually really enjoyed it but at some 
point that stopped too it sort of became less interesting than the other things you can do 
because there are all kinds of really cool experiments you can do when you're out of 
body it's not just flying and walking through walls and exploring the physical world or the 
moon or what have you you will pop over to the other side at some point because again that's 
the natural habitat for your astral body and I started doing all these experiments 
i would try to get to the other side I wanted to meet my mother so I'd often call for her 
and she would never come occasionally she would just appear and I would see her but usually no 
she was not there and neither were my spirit guides most of the books that I'd read the 
astral travelers like robert monroe and others had spirit guides which led them all over the place 
uh I did not perceive any so that was a little puzzling to me and I put that on my bucket list 
but one time I popped over to you know this sort of locale to this lower astral plane 
and I found myself in a field and I popped down and there was a ball an astral 
bull and it freaked me out because this was a very large animal and it looked quite threatening 
and no sooner had I landed in this field when this ball charged me and pinned me to the ground and 
it was actually pretty scary but I kept just I confronted this as a hostile entity which is 
what I guess you're supposed to do and I said nice ball you know nice ball and it disappeared and I 
found myself out of body back at my father's house where I first became lucid often when I'd be out 
of body I would pop over there and that's where I would find myself and so I was pretty happy I was 
started singing I manifested a box of chocolate candies and I ate the whole box and then I woke 
up so weird things happen um I'm a huge uh in I've got a huge interest in disasters and shipwrecks so 
uh I decided I was gonna go visit the wreck of the titanic or the actual incident if I 
could go back in time and see it because I've heard of other people doing this sort of thing 
and so I popped out of my body and I'm flying along in this very cloudy place which is sort of what I often see when I'm trying to get to the other side 
and uh I felt like this tiny speck with these vast clouds below me and it's taking a real 
long time even though I feel like I'm booking it at hundreds of miles per hour 
and I can feel my consciousness beginning to slip away I know I have only a few minutes left 
and I was getting very curious as to what was below me underneath these clouds so I finally just 
dived through the cloud layer and I came out into a field filled with prehistoric looking plants 
and ferns there was lots of water fields of dry grass and I came in for a landing and I'm looking 
around trying to identify where I might be or when and the first thing I noticed was there was 
a lioness just about 20 feet away from me and she was in this pounced position you know like 
ready to pounce and I barely saw her because she blended perfectly with the dry grass and I was 
about to fly away because this was alarming even though I know I'm out of body and I can't be hurt 
i still don't want to be eaten by a lion but I wasn't fast enough this lion pounced and its jaws wrapped around my neck and I felt it sort of biting my head off 
and that wasn't enough for me to leave that was pretty frightening and I wonder if this is perhaps 
a past life because this sort of thing starts to come up when you do out of body exploring and in 
fact uh I started going to a lot of past lives and what I found was you're often taken to the death 
scene or the most traumatic emotional incident in that lifetime which is often the death scene 
not always there was one time I called for a past life I was out of body and I said okay take me 
to see a past life and suddenly this scene came roaring at me and I was inside of it and that 
was a woman who was about to be raped and murdered I remembered it and I didn't want this to happen 
because I remembered it and I didn't want to go through it again so I do what I always do when I want to get back to my body which is wiggle my fingers and toes 
move my uh hands and open and close my eyes blinking furiously and that drew me right back 
but yeah I've recalled a number of past lives uh once I was killed in the holocaust 
i was put on a bus ran to a pit and shot in the back of the head and fell into the pit 
and another time I was in civil war times I was a young black boy who had done something wrong 
or escaped and was locked up in this southern mansion I'll never forget the feeling of looking 
at how rich it was inside this house because where I lived was not like that I can tell you that it 
was very poor just a shanty and inside this house there was lots of leathers and shiny woodwork 
and plush carpets and I was locked in this room and I decided to test the door to see if it was 
locked or not and it was unlocked and so I opened it and I'm creeping through this house and I see 
the front door and I'm about to make a beeline for the front door and get out of there when I see 
this old woman in a rocking chair looking at me and I thought shoot I'm caught I am dead and she 
looked up at me she saw me she smiled and pointed to the front door and motioned for me to go 
so I will always love this little old lady this white woman who let me go free and I ran through 
the door and I ran and I found my family I found my big black mama my brothers and sisters I was 
the oldest in that lifetime that incarnation so this sort of thing happens quite a bit it's 
really cool you get to explore your past lives I was a soldier on a ship that sank I had another 
lifetime where I was a native american in the wild west I guess you would call it 
and uh boy they I was just a little kid and they treated us like dogs 
the white men they looked down on us as if we were animals but what I remembered in that lifetime was 
meeting my uh scout I guess or my uh teacher and he took me on a spirit quest with two other 
young kids we were all about nine years old and we had to perform all these tasks such as tracking 
him and we we had this sort of ra rucksack or this backpack we filled with stones and we had to climb 
a cliff and make it to the top and uh I was the last to do it but I did it and I was so so happy 
and I will never forget this man who taught us how to do this this native american I love him and I 
always will so yeah the past life exploring is all kinds of fun another thing you can do I read 
is if you say your name when you're out of body something really strange is supposed to happen 
i thought okay well this should be interesting uh and I said my own name and nothing happened 
and I did it a few times and nothing happened and finally one time I did it again and it was really 
cool the whole earth around me started shaking I was projected upwards into the sky all these 
firecrackers and skyrockets started exploding all around me I felt like I was in a snow 
globe filled with these really pretty golden flakes it's really cool so yeah that was fun 
you can do all kinds of really interesting things you can practice creating objects
you know build forests and mountains homes uh one way to sort of build control is to create a radio 
or a tv set and you turn it on and you adjust the channels and you watch tv your own out of body 
television so I did that and that took a while to learn how to control but I did it uh once I 
turned on the radio and tried to to you know make some songs play and I was able to get here jim 
croce moving on down the road uh cher the song was do you believe in life after love and then 
i changed the station to the eagles and it was fly like an eagle so there was kind of a message there 
in those songs I think it was really cool or I would create a typewriter which kind of made me 
laugh because I do typing for a living I did it that time and the last thing I want to do is type 
when I'm not getting paid but I was out of body and yeah I created this typewriter and it feels absolutely real things feel 100 physical when you're on the other side 
it feels absolutely real in fact it feels more than real colors are much more beautiful 
one thing I heard was that if you stare at your body it will disappear it will fade away 
i thought no that's that can't be true but this is what robert bruce said he's a pretty well-known 
astral traveler he says just lift your hands up and stare at them and they will fade away 
so I did I lifted my hands up and I examined them and they were much younger than normal they were 
blemish free and slowly they faded away and I became this little tiny ball of light sometimes 
i would create a mirror and look at myself and I saw that all my hair had come back by age 25 
or 30 I had pretty much lost most of my hair not when I'm out of body my hair 
comes back to its full length and uh yeah it's great and uh I'm muscular I'm buff I'm young it's 
amazing it's really cool sometimes I would say just shut up take me where you think I need to go 
and that was always interesting and unexpected one time when I did that I was pulled out of the 
physical world into the what I presume to be the astral planes into an astral forest 
uh felt like a rain forest and there was this beautiful blue stream and it was just filled with 
life energy and very healing so that was fun and I started to wonder about spirit guides as well 
so I would call out to meet my spirit guides and the results were always kind of strange and confusing to me one time I called out take me to 
my spirit guide and I was plopped into this hallway and there was a doorway at the end 
i whipped open the door and there was my brother mark and my sister-in-law christine and the room 
was filled with all kinds of cool stuff bottles and books and just neat stuff and I ran up to them 
and I laughed I'm like did you guys know you're my spirit guide and they seemed as amused as I was 
i did the same experiment and the same thing happened there was a hallway I whipped open the door and there was a young woman there looking at me mischievously with a smile on her face 
and at that time I was actually trying to reach my higher self and I looked at her I'm like are 
you my higher self and she didn't answer one time I called out to meet god like I want to see 
god I was popped out of body I was in my living room I said I want to meet god and this 
very powerful force pulled me right up through the roof it was so powerful I was knocked unconscious 
and I woke up a short time later in the best mood I've ever been in I felt so good I should 
have tried to levitate I probably could have I felt great so yeah there's all kinds of really 
cool experiments you can do I had heard about uh near-death experiencers going down this tunnel and 
basking in the light uh and I wanted to do that and sure enough I went through this tunnel and 
came out and there was this huge bright all-loving all-knowing light and I went towards it I didn't 
get to go very deep inside of it but I sort of sort of did I got to the edge of it and I was just 
soaking it in and it was awesome you get a real feeling of peace and love and all knowingness 
and I could have stayed there forever but I didn't I got pulled back into my body 
another thing I heard about was the akashic library and this is supposedly quite high up 
on the higher astral planes and what I found out is it's quite complicated you have your physical body your ETheric body which is your aura your astral body or the desire body 
and it goes up from there you have your mental body your causal body your akashic body your 
buddhic body your atmo body these are all sort of different levels that you can go to 
and akashic and it was pretty high up there the akashic library supposedly where all your 
lifetimes are recorded every action in the universe is recorded in this huge library 
and I wanted to do it I've read of other people who've done this and I thought if they can do it so can I and uh I called out to go to the akashic library and I hit this black barrier this 
huge giant black wall which I couldn't get through and I pounded and pounded against it and scratched and sort of dug into it and finally I pried open 
this tiny little pin prick of a hole and this divine white light shone down on me 
and I sort of made the opening bigger and I squeezed through and I popped out into this 
very high vibrating realm and it was really cool because I could feel anything that was bad in me 
any guilt or greed or sadness or anger or any negative emotion was completely filtered out I 
had I was left like pure and clean and it was amazing I saw my mom there actually this is a 
later experience so that was really cool that was the first time I didn't feel so worthy and I 
sort of immediately went back but I went back again and did it again uh same sort of thing I had 
to scratch through this barrier and I popped into this higher realm which was absolutely beautiful 
it's very pastoral lots of nature and I looked over ahead of me and there was this beautiful 
sort of lake sparkling like diamonds and a huge building beyond it with pillars and it was 
gorgeous it looked kind of like roman architecture big big tall pillars like the capitol building
and uh there was a little bridge and I kind of flew I my mom was there I'm like can you come 
with me and she said no you have to go alone and so I flew towards it and was really entranced by 
these pillars which look like rose quartz they're huge and they sparkle with this unbelievable light 
this sort of inner light I got pulled inside pretty quickly down this corridor which was 
quite wide and there were open doorways I did perceive that there was someone guiding me 
but I couldn't see them and I was pulled into this room that was pretty small your average 
sort of living room it was perfectly square it had what looked like windows or mirrors or screens 
on the various walls on three walls and I was looking at them and uh I focused on one 
and images started to appear and it was a person it was a man and then a woman and then another man 
and then another man and then a woman and images of different people started flashing by at very 
high speed sort of like you're flipping a deck of cards and I knew instantly what I was looking at 
were my past lives and although I couldn't really focus on who these people were the message was 
that you have a lot of these past lives and it was really amazing really cool and I'm just watching 
them whizz by just completely humbled and amazed when suddenly it stops on one of them and it's 
this beautiful man with sort of silvery gray eyes it's very handsome bald wearing sort of a robe 
and I had the immediate sense that this was me in a future life this was me fully enlightened 
and he sort of stepped out of this screen and stood before me and that was about all I could 
handle I was overcome with the emotion I remember falling to my knees and kind of looking up at 
him and just absolute humbled and amazed and uh wow I mean it was just such a wow moment for me 
that I could barely handle it and uh I couldn't handle it actually I got pulled back into my body 
so that was one of the best experiences I've ever had I did try to find my spirit guides often when 
i was exploring the physical world I heard that your spirit guide is behind you so if you turn 
around you will see them so I would be flying around astrally and I'd quickly turn around 
and to my shock there was a coyote and I had a real distinct impression of a native american it 
and it would dart off and I'd chase after it and it would always elude me I must have done that a 
half dozen times before it became sort of futile and I stopped trying to figure out who this was 
but yeah I think we do all have spirit guides so all kinds of really wonderful things you can do 
but my whole real uh purpose was to try and meet my mother and one day I popped out of my body 
and I was in my living room trying to decide what to do when I saw that I wasn't alone there 
was this beautiful black woman there and she's very attractive she had uh sort of uh braids and 
dark skin and was dressed in a really nice dress and I kind of quickly zoomed up to her 
and wanted to ask her who she was because she looked familiar to me I like sure I knew her but I could not place her and she just grinned at me ear to ear grabbed my shoulders spun me around 
and pushed me on my back through the wall and I was very startled I went right through my 
wall of my living room and I popped out into another place it was a very strange place 
uh it looked earth-like it was looked like an outdoor cafe really with big flag stones 
little tables where people were sitting and talking there was a little wrought iron fence 
surrounding this little courtyard it was really pretty I'm wondering is it you know where is this 
is this france what's going on and I remembered my brother and sister were trying to buy a house 
so I said take me to their new house and boom I'm in front of coming down into this house 
i remember it vividly there was a cliff behind it a red tile roof so I explored that house for a 
while and finally came out the other side turned around and memorized it never did see it again 
but flew upwards realized I wasn't breathing like this is strange I'm out of body you don't 
need to breathe this is very weird and then I remembered I wanted to call for my mom 
and so I shouted out mom mom mom where are you mom I'm here come and boom she appeared 
and this was the biggest reunion I've ever had with her she looked totally beautiful a little ball of light just appeared there um she looked amazing 
and she looked so young I mean she died when she was 49 she had gray hair some wrinkles 
but now she looked younger than me she looked like she was about 18 20 years old 
her hair which had always been black in my memory was now light brown and she looked gorgeous I'm 
like mom you look beautiful and she smiled and we hugged and I tried not to completely lose my mind 
because this was the kind of reunion you just
dream of in your greatest dreams I had lost her tragically and and now she 
she was there and we hugged and hugged and hugged I didn't want to let go 
and finally she you know kind of we separated a little bit and we're holding hands and she 
i just stared at her and she says you haven't seen anything yet not in so many words but sort of gave 
me that message and took me by the hand and we flew towards the other side we popped out in 
this other area which was very strange it was this landscape filled with little dark stones 
for miles and miles around she manifested a vehicle an american luxury car she sat in 
the driver's seat I sat in the passenger seat I left my butt off I'm like what's this and she's 
she was laughing at my reaction she said just wait I've got something to show you again not 
in so many words but just mentally and we zoomed off in this car and hit another barrier sort of 
the veil between the worlds I guess and we popped out into what I now know to be the heavenly realms 
and I cannot describe to you how beautiful this area is this is where we all go when we die 
and uh it is a beautiful natural scene with forests and flowers and fields and rivers 
and it's gorgeous the grass is so green the flowers glow with an inner light everything 
glows with light there are no shadows here at all everything glows and the air itself sparkles the 
atmosphere hugs you and loves you you could not be in a bad mood if you tried uh in this in this 
astral plane and uh we came for a landing in this field and I'm just looking at it totally amazed 
my mom is looking around looking at me and enjoying my reaction and I look at her and 
i'm like wow this is amazing and she takes my hand and we fly over to the end of the 
field where there's a little stream a little creek and we land inside of it 
she wanted to show me this and I was amazed at the texture of the water because it was very cool 
very wet you could feel it but it didn't get you wet in the same way water gets you 
wet here because as soon as you'd lift a hand or a leg out you were dry again 
and it felt really just a really silky texture and she's laughing at me as I'm sort of feeling the 
water and she takes a piece of algae and throws it at me hits me square on the chest and face 
like mom she was always a little bit mischievous a little bit of a jokester 
and she threw another piece at me I'm like okay it's war and I scooped down 
grabbed some algae and I threw it at her and we had a little water fight for three to five minutes just splashing around in the water and uh it was all kinds of fun 
and really interesting because yeah as soon as you step out and we did we stepped out and went 
to the side you're perfectly clean again it just comes right off of you you're not wet anymore 
and she was dressed in shirt and pants and so was I she never really was big on dresses and 
i was just amazed I'm like wow this is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life 
and she said just wait I've got more to show you again not in words but in just a mental impression 
and she grabbed my hand and we went flying upwards into a higher plane and we hit another barrier it's hard to describe but it's sort of like
hitting a curtain or hitting like the surface of a pool and diving into it 
but are a high a higher energetic sheet and we popped through it and I couldn't believe my eyes 
this was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen it was this vast
field of quartz crystals is what it looked like uh some of these crystals were 
quite large the big of a house somewhere small like a boulder somewhere rock-sized somewhere 
like fine sand some of these were translucent perfectly clear others were sort of opaque 
some were shining light others were sort of just reflecting light but it was absolutely gorgeous 
i had never seen anything so beautiful ever and I just couldn't believe my eyes had no idea that 
anything this beautiful could exist or that there was a place like this I was dumbfounded and my mom was thought this was very amusing because I just couldn't I kept 
just shaking my head with complete awe and what was really interesting is my vision changed I am 
slightly nearsighted but you can see absolutely perfectly on the other side or even the second 
you pop out of body your vision is absolutely crisp and clear but it was even more so here 
you could see the kind of detail you cannot see here on earth there's much more detail 
and not only that you have 360 degree vision panoramic vision which was really 
disorienting to sort of see everything all at once and uh it's made me a little bit dizzy at first 
until I started to get used to it and another thing I noticed was you could look off into the 
distance and you could zoom forward and see it in great detail so I started playing with that 
looking at you know a ridge that must have been I don't know a mile two miles away 
and zooming in and just examining these crystals uh and it was just white crystals in all 
directions it was really really pretty and finally I look back at my mom she's sitting up on one of 
these very large crystals she's got a really good posture she always did she's just looking at me 
very patiently grinning ear to ear smiling at my obvious awe and enjoyment of displace 
and I'm looking at her thinking you know thank you oh my god this is amazing wow and she points to the ground and she says look at the ground and I did and she did 
this little trick she turned it bright orange it was brightest orange in the center and sort of 
faded as you're going outwards to about a three foot circle that was just bright bright orange 
like wow that's a cool trick and she says go ahead and pick some of this stuff up and eat it 
put it in your mouth and eat it I'm like what she said go ahead she motioned pick it up pick up it 
was like sand pick it up and put it in your mouth I'm like okay you're the boss so I bent down and 
i scooped some of this stuff up you could feel it it's like fine sand and I put it in my mouth 
and wow it was amazing it exploded with orange flavor not really orange candy or orange juice but 
that flav I mean it was twice the flavor of orange juice it was so orange I couldn't believe it it's 
just exploding with flavor and crackling and popping and swirling around in my mouth it 
was the most amazing taste sensation I have ever had in my entire life and she loved you know she 
loved my reaction I was totally awestruck and she laughed and I'm like wow that was amazing 
and then she took my hand and we flew back to the pastoral realm the heavenly realms and we sat down 
on this little bench there's these pathways and benches and flowering trees and grasses there's 
other people walking along and you know singly or couples or small groups everyone's really nice 
uh everyone's really happy and we just sat there and talked for a little while I forgot much of 
this conversation unfortunately but what I do remember is it soon became time to go 
and she pointed up at the sky and there it was filled with these white fluffy clouds it's really 
one of the few times I've actually seen sky blue sky it's usually kind of whitish and just 
really really bright I never have seen knight on the heavenly realms 
and she pointed to the sky and spelled out in fluffy white clouds I love you I love you I love 
you and I'm like wow I love you too and I started to feel this force pulling on my body I could kind 
of sense this tunnel opening up behind me it was my turn time to go I had to go I didn't want to 
but it was clear that it I had to leave and next thing I knew I'm hurtling down this tunnel like 
people in near-death experiences describe and I popped out in this lower realm I manifested 
a dream journal and I wrote everything down and I had to pop down several levels and kept 
manifesting a dream dream journal not my real dream journal but a dream dream journal because 
i just sort of stepped down this memory because this is a rather high astral plane 
which took me a while to get to but after that one experience I've been back many many times and uh 
it's awesome every time I'm there all my memories come flooding back I go there you know regularly 
practically nightly I think we all do actually uh and when I'm there all my memories come back 
i remember everything I wonder how I could have ever thought my mom was dead because she's not 
and I even get to the point where I forget the physical world I am living there and then suddenly 
i am pulled back and I am plopped back in my body and then I remember oh shoot 
i'm actually living on earth not there and much of the memory leaves me I'm never able to take back 
all these memories I just remember remembering but I keep keep going back I still go back 
uh and I see a lot of people there too including my family members who are alive and it's very 
strange because I finally became really curious about this and I walked up to my brother stephen 
i'm like do you know that you're out of body and he says oh yeah yeah I know I'm like oh okay 
um well you're having an out-of-body experience are you going to remember this he says no I won't remember I said well how could you not remember if you're conscious here he says 
i don't know I just won't remember I'm like why don't you try to remember he says I won't remember 
and we had a little bit of a argument about this I'm like well try to remember and he says I can't I won't I'm not going to remember so stop trying to ask me 
and I sort of gave up and called him up the next morning he of course he did not remember 
and I tried the same with my sister victoria I'm like another time I saw her there like victoria 
you realize we're on the other side and she's like yeah yeah we're in the in between place is what she said I'm like oh okay that's an interesting way of putting it and I'm like do you think you'll 
remember she says no I'm not able to remember I'm like but how can you say that how can you say 
you're not gonna remember if you're talking to me right now while we're here she says I just don't 
have the ability I'm sorry I'm like well I'm going to remember if I can remember you can remember 
and she said well I'll try but I won't I'm like how about I try and help you and so I 
manifested a ufo I created a ufo by just thinking you can create anything on the other side 
so I made a ufo and it was a good one it was this huge silver saucer with colored lights 
she looked at it and went wow so did I it was amazing it looked like this ufo and I said do 
you think you'll remember that and she said she might and uh we went you know I went back 
to my body and I called her up and she had no memory of it whatsoever so I've tried to 
do this and have never succeeded in getting any of my other family members to remember 
so that's quite frustrating uh but at one point our dog maxine passed away and I thought well I'd 
like to go see her and I popped out on the other side in these astral realms and she came running 
up to me she's a very reserved dog and uh pretty old when she died you know hobbling around and 
she had all her vitality back and she ran up and she licked me on the face which was something she 
would never do she only licked you if she was in a really good mood and uh you had to really 
convince her and to like give me your paw or you know lick me and she she came zooming up and 
licked me and I saw our other dog clyde and uh he also was really young and vital and it's amazing 
so I would visit them regularly and the last time I visited maxine she came running up to me 
looked up at me and said hi preston and that knocked me over um she talked to me in english 
i laughed really hard uh I did not know this was the thing I've since found out that yeah your 
pets begin to learn how to talk so that's really cool and I can tell you with complete confidence 
that you will meet your loved ones who have passed away on the other side it's really amazing 
one time I popped out on the other side and there was a family friend rex a black man 
who was somewhat ill would cough a lot and uh you know this sort of thing 
and didn't have great posture but I looked at him he was standing upright he looked healthy 
and glowing so brightly his skin which was really quite dark looked almost white 
and I'm like rex what are you doing here and he looked very bewildered really confused 
didn't seem to quite understand what was happening and I just looked at him and sort of 
looked at him in an amazement and said hi and that was it and came back to my body and I thought well 
i guess I should call him uh he's really my father's friend not mine I don't know him that 
well but I didn't have to call him because we got a call that rex had had a stroke a severe stroke 
and as far as I know he doesn't remember having a near-death experience but that taught me that even 
people who don't remember having a near-death experience probably do so that was really cool 
so you will meet your loved ones on the other side and one more thing that I would like to mention 
is rescuing lost souls this is something that's quite common with astral travelers 
they will come upon people who are earthbound for whatever reason whether they're drug addicts 
or had a traumatic death or are attached to their home they remain earthbound this is a huge problem 
and I thought gosh you know I've never done that I didn't think I had done that it turned out I probably was doing it because here's what happened I sort of put out popped out of my body and gave 
that command like I want to rescue a lost soul and I found myself being taken to this home and I was 
pulled down into the crawl space underneath the home and there was a little girl there a very sad 
heartbroken crying little girl blonde hair blue eyes she must have been about six seven years old 
and she was all curled up and crying and broke my heart I'm like oh you know honey 
what's wrong are you okay and she looked at me with sad eyes and I said would you like to fly 
i can take you flying because this is something I would sometimes do I would come upon people 
who I thought were on earth and I would take them and fly them over to the other side so I 
probably was rescuing lost souls because this is something I'd done before without really realizing it I would come upon people and be like you want to learn how to fly I can show you 
and I'd fly them over and uh she looked at me and just kind of shook her head she was really scared 
i'm not sure she trusted me or who I was she had no idea who I was but uh I was determined 
to help and I was wrecking my brain like what to do and I hit upon an idea I said okay 
how would you like to see your mom I can take you to your mom and her eyes widened a little bit and 
she didn't quite smile but she sort of brightened up a little bit and nodded her head I said okay 
i'll take you to your mom here take my hand and we'll go right now and she took my hand and we flew upwards real quickly and I took her to the other 
side I lost track of her as soon as we hit that area I tried real hard to follow her but 
apparently this is hard to do I've read about this that watch very carefully 
what happens because they will probably disappear and that's exactly what happened 
once we got to the other side she was gone so I thought well I did it so that was 
good enough for me and uh yeah I've since had probably hundreds of out-of-body experiences 
uh these experiences that I've talked about so far from 1988 to about 2003 
and I wrote these experiences down that I've presented here in my book out of body exploring 
a beginner's approach so if you want to learn more about these experiences I would definitely 
recommend checking out this book because I've had a lot of these experiences and I've kind of 
glossed over a lot of the details because this is a long story I mean these are hundreds of out-of-body experiences I've had thousands probably and since then I've gotten a lot better 
i've really only touched the surface of the things you can do I mean I've never seen my silver cord 
prior to this I did that I went and visited enlightened masters I visited healing temples 
on the other side I was able to have shared out-of-body experiences with someone else 
who is really good at it boy she took me on some incredible journeys into outer space and 
into the past all kinds of stuff I was able to explore the physical world more I went to area 
51 I went inside I went inside the malibu anomaly the sort of undersea base off the coast of malibu 
i actually went and visited the hellish realms the lower astral planes which was 
really cool met all kinds of ghosts and stuff and yeah I have currently having all kinds of really 
amazing adventures which I'm putting together in another book so that's going to have to be a video 
for another time but hopefully I'll get that one out soon enough but all these other experiences 
that I've talked about are yeah again in my book out of body exploring a beginner's approach 
and I cannot recommend trying this enough it will absolutely change your life 
it will wake you up psychically uh you will start having all kinds of dreams which come true 
clairvoyance uh past life recall telepathy I can't tell you how many dreams I've had 
which have come true are just spontaneous visions I'll just tell you one or two one 
involved uh an earthquake I woke up right before an earthquake occurred 
and boom it hit and uh this sort of thing a lot of a lot of dreams come true it's 
really quite a long story uh but I really want everyone who hears us to at least give this a try 
and if you think it's scary or dangerous it's not it's as safe as sleeping and in fact what 
i've found is a number of cases where people have actually been healed I've documented some 20 cases 
of people been healed of physical illness some of these serious and chronic illnesses others minor 
but yeah it's a very healing experience the only real obstacle is laziness skepticism and fear 
so if you just take the time to do it you can do it if you believe you can do it you can do it 
and if you overcome your fear it's quite easy and the benefits are unbelievable you basically 
just about double your lifespan because all this time you're spending unconscious 
or not remembering rather because you are conscious on the other side you can have access to 
that and basically have all these really wonderful experiences you can live out any fantasy you want 
it is absolutely amazing the benefits are unbelievable it completely erases your fear 
of death so that alone is worth it and there are no special qualifications 
i've done this under the influence of alcohol it's not as easy but it can be done
and you don't have to fast or be a vegetarian or lose weight or be a monk or a priest or a yogi 
anyone can do this most people will have an out of body like experience at least once in 
their lifetime flying dreams are really half remembered out of body experiences many dreams 
or half-remembered out-of-body experiences you won't become lost you won't become possessed 
you won't go too far away or anything like that because you are always get 
pulled back into your body by your silver cord it's absolutely as safe as sleeping and
let me just tell you real quickly how to do it because it's not hard and there's quite a 
bit of literature out this I've refined it into three or four simple steps and the first step is 
physical relaxation this is where a lot of people I think fall short because it's difficult to relax 
you want to relax to the point where you can't feel your body this is best done at night as 
you're going to bed or even better early in the morning when you wake up so if you allow an extra 
hour of sleep that's a really good idea and just relax your body to the point where you can't feel 
it or you feel certain sensations like heaviness or lightness or numbness or tingling or vertigo 
ultimately what you want to feel is a vibration the vibratory state and it can be mild or can 
be very powerful like a jet engine roaring through you so don't be alarmed if you feel a lot of power 
pulsing through your body it's a really good sign that you're primed and ready to go out of body 
so just relax relax relax sometimes takes me as long as 20 minutes other times I just plop down 
and whoosh I'm out but I think that will come with practice the second step would be mentally 
relaxing we have a sort of stream of consciousness that's constantly going through our heads 
we are thinking thinking thinking on multiple levels we're thinking of the songs that we 
heard we're thinking of the movies we saw we are thinking of the work we have to do everything that 
we have put off or procrastinated we're thinking about that the arguments we've had all of this is 
flowing through your head on multiple levels so you want to kind of just mentally relax 
emotionally relax center yourself and watch your thoughts once you've physically relaxed 
you turn your attention 180 degrees ignore the environment and look inward at your thoughts 
until they start to turn to images you'll see colors and lights you may hear voices that's fine 
it's a good sign it means you're you're mentally relaxed and you're about to slip into the dream 
state if you're not careful but don't do that if you have to you know lay on your back or sit in an 
easy chair whatever you have to do to not fall asleep do that and maintain your awareness and 
the next step would be affirmations and by that I mean you say to yourself I am 
going out of body I am out of body right now I will remember everything that happens 
tonight I remember everything take me out of body appeal to your spirit guides 
so you really want to sort of affirm that you are going to go out of body 
and you have to really focus on this and by that I mean sort of wrap together your imagination 
your intention your willpower put it all together intend to do this want to do it desire it feel it 
use your willpower and really just focus on it and affirm that you will go out of body and you 
will remember everything that happens and then you do the last step which is visualizations now that 
you're physically relaxed you're mentally relaxed and you've told yours you know you're focusing on 
wanting to do this visualize yourself rolling out of bed that works pretty well another one that 
works really well is visualizing yourself running as fast as you can just running that will pull you 
right out of your body another would be visualize yourself on a swing set going back and forth 
anything that involves movement will work visualize yourself spinning like wonder woman 
just spinning in place visualize yourself on the bow of a ship going up and down in the waves 
visualize yourself on an escalator or an elevator visualize yourself holding onto 
a balloon and being pulled upwards visualize a rope hanging down from the ceiling and reaching 
out and grabbing it and pulling yourself up I've done all of these methods and all of them work 
and there are other methods one way is to visualize yourself standing in another place 
perhaps a natural garden that you love a room you know really well 
another place that's not your bedroom your living room a friend's house any other place and suddenly 
it will coalesce around you and you will find yourself in it another really good method if 
you're having trouble with this is to focus on a deceased loved one I call this the love bridge 
just call out to a person who you love or know who has is has died who is on the other side 
and imagine what they look like what they sound like what it feels like to hug them call out to 
them ask them to help you and they will come and take you to the other side this has worked for me 
a number of times call out to your spirit guides we all have them we all have people 
on the other side who love us dearly and are working very hard to raise our awareness this 
is how synchronicities and coincidences happen and they are there for you so absolutely try that 
another thing that's really important to do is keep a dream journal out of body experiences are very closely related to dreams many dreams are out of body experiences 
so you really want to focus on remembering what happens to you at night each morning don't move 
just lay there and remember your dreams you want to get to the point where you're remembering three 
or four dreams per night and that's when you'll start to have lucid dreams that's when you'll 
start to have precognitive dreams that's when you start having real dreams the purpose of dreaming 
uh you'll will become apparent to you because you will wake up and become lucid in the dream state 
and now I just want to give you one last instruction and this is the real clue 
on how to have out-of-body experiences and I guarantee it will work if you do it this is a guaranteed method and all you have to do is try it and it will work 
and this is called reality testing critical thinking uh throughout the day you want 
to look around you and see if there are any anomalies anything that doesn't look quite right 
almost every dream you will have will have some sort of anomaly to it your driveway will 
be facing the wrong direction the color of your carpet is wrong the couch that you used to have 
is now there in your living room there's a window where there isn't one some anomaly something that's just different and not right the pink color is wrong 
the kitchen is too big your you know it could be anything and uh each dream has this and this 
is designed by your higher self to wake you up to make you question reality and see if you are 
dreaming or out of body so you want to start doing this during the day 
at least three times a day preferably much more ten times a day would be ideal 
make it a routine anytime before you eat anytime you go to the bathroom anytime you do any chore 
spend 30 seconds doing this looking around and seeing if there are any anomalies 
it will feel ridiculous at first because you know you're awake when you're awake but this is the problem when you are out of body everything is so real so vivid it never occurs to 
you that you could possibly be out of body and you are so you really have to start questioning 
reality and looking around and asking yourself is it at all possible I am dreaming 
is it at all possible I am out of body and if there's even the slightest doubt the slightest 
you are you are out of body and one way to test this if you don't see any anomalies 
is to jump up and see if you levitate it's going to feel a little ridiculous but try it just jump 
up and if you're not in a place where you can do that take an object like a pen and drop it 
and it will float normally it will just drop it might kind of go down really slowly but if you're 
on the other side it will float it can be any object a little tennis ball you know an eraser it 
doesn't matter just try to lift something up and drop it and see what happens another thing you can 
do is try to push your finger through your desk or perhaps the wall just push your finger through the 
wall and see what happens if your finger doesn't go through the wall that means you are awake in 
the physical plane but if it does boy you're going to get a shock because at one point it will so if 
you do this 10 times every day while you're awake what will happen is you have developed a routine 
and you will continue this behavior in the out of body state in the dream state and what will happen 
is you'll be at work or something at the office or doing your chores cleaning your house or whatever 
it is you do during the day and it'll be like okay I'm gonna do this ridiculous exercise and jump up 
and to your shock you will levitate or whatever object you throw up into the air will float 
or you'll suddenly push your finger right through the wall and it will be an incredible revelation 
it will be a mini enlightenment and suddenly everything will just fade away 
and uh you will realize that you were actually dreaming or out of body and often you'll find that 
you're floating above your body right above your bed in your room or you might be completely on 
the other side because we all go to the heavenly realms as near as I can tell on a nightly basis 
so this is the ultimate exercise that will work it's guaranteed but you do have to do it 
you absolutely have to try this and three times a day is probably sufficient but it will work much 
more quickly if you do it 10 times a day and that is the real key to learning how to go out of body 
and from there you can learn how to move how to see and start doing all kinds of wonderful 
experiments and visit your deceased loved ones go to healing temples learn about your spirit guides 
your past lives heal yourself physical illness the things you can do is absolutely amazing 
and that's why I wanted to do this video because it completely transformed my life I absolutely love this it's something I will never give up because it's truly enriched my life to 
an unbelievable degree and I cannot recommend it enough I really really hope that you guys at least 
try doing this and I guarantee it will change your life for the better and that's why I wanted to do 
this video because it's like discovering a whole new world and I guarantee you will love it you can
