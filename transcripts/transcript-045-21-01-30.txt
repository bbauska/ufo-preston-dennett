THE MYSTERY OF ANGEL HAIR
Jan 30, 2021

Summary:
Jan 30, 2021
Angel Hair: it's a mysterious cobweb-like substance being ejected from UFOs. Despite countless numbers of UFO encounters, reports of Angel Hair are exceedingly rare. But in a handful of UFO sightings, this mysterious material drifts down from the sky like cotton candy, covering trees, bushes, fields, homes, cars, telephone wires...everywhere.

This video presents more than twenty UFO events involving Angel Hair. Some of the cases include:

1952: Oloron, France. A large mother ship and thirty UFOs blanket the town with huge volumes of a stringy white substance.
1953: San Fernando Valley, CA. Jets chase a silver sphere, which ejects enough Angel Hair to cover a two block area.
1954: Tuscany, Italy. A football game with 10,000 fans is interrupted by UFOs which swoop down and release a glittering, white, flaky substance over the crowd.
1954: Marysville, OH. More than 60 students and teachers at Jerome Elementary see a UFO which covers not only the entire school, but a six-mile radius around them.
1955. Whitsett, NC. More than 120 students and teachers at Whitsett Elementary experience a dramatic UFO display involving enormous quantities of what looks like cotton candy. One student even tries to eat it!

And this is just the beginning. Cases reach back many years and continue to occur today. 

In most cases, Angel Hair dissolves and evaporates in minutes, or upon contact. In a few cases, however, there are immense quantities of the stuff, and eyewitnesses are able to preserve precious samples. In a few rare cases, Angel Hair has been subjected to scientific analysis. And the results are astonishing. 

What is angel hair? What is it made of? Why is it being ejected from UFOs? Is this just the "exhaust" from flying saucer engines? Is this material being intentionally ejected? Most importantly, what is it made of?

This video presents the evidence as we know it so far. Angel Hair is important because it is tangible, physical evidence of the existence of UFOs. Read more about these cases and more in my book, "Not from Here: Volume 2."

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and the title of today's presentation is the mystery of 
angel hair also known as chevro de la saint-vierge in france or in italy spun glass it goes by 
different names but it's described as being this sort of cotton candy spiderweb like substance 
that's ejected from ufos what's very interesting is when you consider the number of ufo sightings 
these angel hair cases are very rare there's only a handful really and we still don't know exactly 
what it is or how it's formed so that's why I wanted to do this video and just explore some of 
these cases i've collected about 20 cases from all over the world a few are well known some I don't 
think are well known they're certainly all very interesting and provide sort of a unique insight I 
think into the ufo phenomenon first case I want to talk about is actually very well known and 
this occurred over oleron france it occurred on october 17 1952 and involved many many witnesses 
one main witness is jeanne ivey prejean he was the superintendent of old around high school and was 
in his home with his family and they ran outside and saw this very large cylindrical shaped object 
it was quite some distance away but was even more astonishing is there was about  30 other objects darting around it and these objects were hovering they were moving zigzag 
formations and sometimes would make sparks of electricity like bolts of lightning going between 
them and as all this is going on this weird angel hair substance started to fall as jean evay says 
and i'm quoting a cottony cloud of these strange shapes was floating against the blue sky all these 
strange objects left an abundant trail behind them which slowly fell to the ground as it disappeared 
so there was a lot of it was hanging on trees on roofs on telephone wires 
it was described as being very gossamer like with fine fibers of wool or nylon 
and it lasted several hours actually a bunch of people saw this they gathered samples of it 
and rolled it into little balls at which point it would become gelatinous and evaporate 
the gym teacher gathered a huge handful of stuff and said it was covering the school field 
another teacher took a sample of it and tried to burn it and it kind of burned very easily like 
cellophane is how he described it the science teacher monsieur poulet was able to gather a 
big 36 foot long strand on a stick and he wound it all up on the edge of end of a stick and it 
just simply evaporated so while they did try to save samples they were not able to 
this substance evol dissolved fairly quickly in their case it did last a number of hours but uh 
completely dissolved following that and pretty much a good portion of the town of oleron 
saw this but it was also seen by people in neighboring areas a bunch of hunters 
in the joe's bay valley saw it and also in the nearby town of juranse they also saw including 
the mayor of the town so this was a very widely viewed incident and it got a lot of publicity 
researchers later found out that the nearby radar station at mont demarc 
actually caught these objects on radar detected quote unusual activity 
so that was good verification corroboration uh despite this there was quite a bit of skepticism 
uh people said oh perhaps these people saw spider webs and uh this of course upset the 
witnesses and certainly didn't explain how this this substance was able to dissolve so quickly 
nor did it explain the ufos but the whole incident did get a lot of publicity it was in newspapers 
and it's a very early angel hair case and really one of many all across the world it was only 10 
days after the ola raw case when there was another very similar incident not too far away in gayak 
france this occurred on october 27 1952 at around 5 p.m one lady she was in her home when she heard 
her chickens outside acting strangely she ran outside and described pretty much what the other 
witnesses saw a huge cylindrical shaped object with scores of flying saucers zigzagging around it 
there were about 1200 feet in altitude so pretty low and uh we're out there for quite some time 
long enough for her to call out her neighbors in fact by the time these objects moved away more 
than a hundred people had seen them the whole display lasted about 20 minutes and during this 
time it sent down volumes of this weird substance angel hair witnesses described it as looking sort 
of like spun glass wall and when gathered again it became gelatinous it turned jelly-like and 
just dissolved and no samples were saved however again they did get official confirmation from the 
local weather observatory where witnesses there described seeing quote a silvery metallic disk 
so those are two cases from france here's a case from australia 
we'll just move through time here going one year later october 1953 pretty much exactly one year 
later and in this case the sample was saved and researcher brian boldman is one of the experts 
on angel hair he did a whole study of it and he says a sample was recovered and made available for 
laboratory analysis the examination revealed that the substance consisted of a nylon-like amorphous 
mass with traces of magnesium calcium boron and silicone since then the original material 
which was kept in an airtight container shrank from three to a mere half inch without residue
so yeah it's very hard to collect samples of this even harder to conduct a scientific analysis 
but this analysis did detrac detect these trace materials here's another case which 
i find very interesting because it occurred literally less than two miles from where i'm 
sitting right now this occurred over the san fernando valley in resida on november 16 1953 
witnesses described seeing a huge silver sphere racing at low altitude across the san fernando 
valley was being chased by three air force jets and as it zipped away it ejected a huge 
volume of angel hair and this angel hair fell on about a two block radius covering homes cars 
telephone wires trees yards streets uh covered one guy's bakery truck completely 
and I was actually able to talk to the witness's daughter who confirmed that oh yeah that that was 
my dad's truck and uh he was the one who described this so yeah very close to where I am right now 
one another witness miss corstin she says and i'm quoting it fell onto bushes and jumped out 
to passerbys as hair does to a magnetized comb so it appears to have sort of a static charge 
to it which might be significant she grabbed a sample and said it just dissolved in her hands 
but she watched as the air force actually showed up air force officers came and tried to gather 
a 12 foot long strip that was hanging from a tree and she doesn't say what happened to this material 
but other people arrived as well to study it engineers from lockheed 
and douglas aircraft arrived and they were reportedly skeptical and quote sneering 
but left the scene silent and thoughtful so they came away apparently convinced that 
something was real um it looks like samples were gathered but we don't know what happened to them 
in that case uh 1954 one year later was really the big year for angel hair there was a number of very 
high quality cases and uh probably the first that year occurred in puenie california this occurred 
on february 1st 1954 the witness was mrs daly and she saw this object fly overhead over her home 
and it ejected a volume of this angel hair she said it was very shiny and very light and it just 
floated down and again covered all the trees and bushes and telephone wires in the fields she tried 
to gather a sample but as she says it vanished when I tried to touch it with my hands she 
called mount wilson observatory but they were very skeptical and of no help whatsoever unfortunately 
uh but nine yeah 1954 was a huge year in particularly october so we're going to move 
back to france now to the town of growlay france this occurred on october 13th 1954 
when crowds of people in the village of growley watched this huge white disc shaped object 
was hovering and darting around and then suddenly it seemed to explode as one witness says mr 
karanak he's a tanner as he says I had been following the bizarre craft for several seconds 
when it exploded in full flight at the same time a circular object very much smaller and 
silvery seemed to spurt out from the mass and continued straight towards the south where it 
soon disappeared while the burst fragments of the soft disk scattered out through the sky in 
a multitude of shapeless fragments which began to fall gently like shreds of cloth or paper 
he observed this through binoculars actually and this huge volume of this material 
slowly drifted down covering trees telephone wires in the ground 
and it clung like cobwebs the witnesses said but it wilted and sort of withered away 
very quickly especially if you tried to touch it or just melt away 
they did manage to gather some samples however which they sent to the police  police sent them off to a chemist and the chemist wasn't able to do a proper chemical analysis 
because the substance just evaporated too quickly he was able to take a small sample of it 
and subject it to a flame and said it burned very quickly without any vapors no smoke 
but wasn't able to get any chemical analysis done unfortunately
five days after that incident there was another incident in france this is a very widely viewed 
incident again this occurred in the town of vienna france uh october 18th 1954 these white objects 
were again zigzagging over the town and literally covering it in this weird substance we know as 
angel hair as one witness says his name is monsieur lelonde as he says about a half an hour 
later a sort of rain of cobwebs came down on the airfield as thick as closely woven cloth handfuls 
were falling on the ground on the hangar on the airplanes and we started to pick up great bunches 
it felt like holding rubber threads very fine very soft to the touch which matted together and 
it once evaporated in our fingers without leaving any sensation at all any odor or the least trace 
we had the impression that it was the heat of our hands that made the material melt he 
was able to gather a large sample which he placed in a sealed container and put it in a cool place 
however when he opened it up the next day the container was completely empty so yeah again very 
hard to save this material which really begs the question what is it what are we dealing with here 
here was probably one of the ultimate cases really in the world certainly the perhaps the 
most widely viewed certainly of modern times this occurred on october 27 1954 in italy in tuscany 
actually during a soccer game well they call it football but this occurred at the stadio artemi 
granshi which is a huge stadium during a football game and there were about 10 000 fans in this 
stadium at the time this incident occurred when a number of ufos at least two perhaps more showed up 
and started darting around hovering and as soon as they appeared an eerie silence fell over the 
crowd and then as these objects started moving around the silence transformed into a huge roar 
as all the fans started shouting and jumping up and down and looking at this thing and pointing 
and it appeared to be some kind of display these objects must have wanted to be seen 
because they're over a stadium with 10 000 people and they started emitting this weird material 
known as angel hair and there's a lot of witnesses of course one witness was actually one of the 
players footballer ardicho magnini says and i'm quoting I remember everything 
from a to z it was something that looked like an egg that was moving slowly slowly 
everyone was looking up and also there was some glitter coming down from the sky silver glitter we 
were astonished we had never seen anything like it before we were absolutely shocked another witness 
was romolo tucci as he says in those years everybody was talking about aliens everybody 
was talking ufos and we had the experience we saw them we saw them directly for real 
another witness was jiji bonnie as he says they were moving very fast and then they just stopped 
it all lasted a couple of minutes I would like to describe them as being like cuban cigars I think 
they were extraterrestrial that's what I believe and there's no other explanation I can give myself 
another witness is roberto pinotti he actually became a ufo investigator 
as an adult but at the time he was just a kid and he says and I quote I remember in broad daylight 
seeing the roofs of the houses in florence covered in this white substance for one hour 
and like snow it just evaporated another witness I mean this was seen not only over the stadium but 
all over italy actually not only on that day but in the days that followed 
another witness was gennaro luceri and pietro la strucci they stood on the balcony of their 
hotel in saint mark's square in venice italy and saw two what they described as uh 
shining spindles flying across the sky and again leaving a trail of this angel hair 
uh there was a journalist a very well-known journalist who worked at a  a high-profile newspaper uh his name was giorgio battini and his phone started ringing off the hook 
from people who were seeing this stuff he says he received over 100 calls  and he went outside and actually observed these objects himself he described them as silver 
globes and he went outside to investigate further and saw huge volumes of this angel hair 
just draped all over this forest and he gathered a bunch of samples and 
sent them to the institute of chemical analysis at the university of florence as it turned out 
a number of other people had done the same darn thing an engineering student by the name 
of alfredo jacques posey also sent large samples to the university of florence and these samples 
were in fact able to be chemically analyzed professor cozy and professor giovanni canary 
were able to conduct a chemical analysis of the angel hair they subjected subjected the material 
to a spectrographic analysis and concluded that the elements or that the angel hair 
contained the elements boron silicon calcium and magnesium so again we have verification because 
this is pretty much exactly what was found in other cases so that's a really remarkable case 
another extraordinary case which makes me wonder you know what's going on here occurred on the same 
year uh 1954 it was about a month later november 30th 1954 and this was over marysville 
ohio specifically over jerome elementary school it was a bright beautiful sunny day 
the kids have been granted an extra recess there were some 60 kids out there  on the playground when this metallic object showed up it had either portholes or lights on it 
it was very bright almost too bright to look at at times and it was darting around finally one of 
the kids goes and gets the teacher or actually it was the principal uh principal rodney warwick and 
he runs out and he couldn't believe his eyes as he says I have never seen anything like it and 
he said it was so bright he actually couldn't even look at it it was too bright for his eyes 
and as he called out for another teacher mrs ditmar to come running out and take 
a look and she came running out but right before she arrived this object darts away 
and this is when it leaves nenormous quantity of angel hair which fell down for like the next hour 
directly over the school and actually the surrounding area as miss ditmar says i'm quoting 
it was the most beautiful soft white looking tufts like cotton slowly floating to the ground 
the substance had long fibers very much as if someone had taken strands of angel hair and pushed 
some in bunches towards the middle or end leaving a trail of fibers attached to it so these were 
long long strands the children were gathering big bunches of it and bringing it to the teachers and 
they were pulling on it they said it was actually very really uh quite durable tough to break 
but if you touched it on one end it would curl up into a little ball and disappear it came 
in two main forms big long strands and what looked like cottony balls and it covered the 
complete playground and actually you know for a couple of miles around the entire school 
uh miss ditmar and rodney warrick the principal started experimenting with it as miss ditmar says 
it was very fine and soft to touch it did not stick to our hands but when we held two 
ends and pulled it stretched without tearing where it stretched it had a shiny appearance 
the part we held between our fingers very quickly seemed to go to nothing  however we could roll it between our fingers in a very very tiny ball in a short while our hands 
had a green stain on them I soon washed my hands in warm water and the stain rinsed quickly off 
now the principal rodney warwick also got his hands stained green from handling this stuff 
he decided not to wash his hands so we could see what would happen and he said his hands  felt cold and clammy for a short duration at which point the green stain just disappeared 
and the substance presumably evaporated uh he says it reminded him very much of 
asbestos fibers that's what it looked like to him though he made it clear that it was not 
asbestos so this covered the school for about three miles around as miss ditmar says 
when we left the school we noticed it clinging to the grass the flagpole and some on the cars 
i believe the thing that impressed me even further was what we saw as we drove the three miles to 
columbus road the telephone wires were completely woven shut as if hands had carefully spread angel 
hair out very evenly not only this but the telephone wires were connected to the electric 
wires on the other side of the road so that it was like a misty canopy over the road for three miles 
so yeah this is a huge volume of this substance whatever it is the principal rodney 
warwick gathered a sample and gave it to the local newspaper the journal tribune and reporters there 
immediately sent it off to lockbourne air force base in columbus for an analysis though 
unfortunately we never heard back from the air force regarding what the substance was but this 
case caused a lot of publicity it was investigated by leonard stringfield by james mcdonald also by 
professor c a mani who actually got to interview the teacher and some of the kids as he says 
the letters of the children are most interesting each telling in his own words what he or she saw 
these letters support in them in an impressive way the more detailed statements of the teachers 
there's no question in my mind of the sincerity and the truthfulness of these statements
so this is an incredible case and i'm wondering if this was an intentional display or was this 
substance an accidental byproduct and the reason I say that is because of the previous incident where 
these objects were apparently showing themselves over a stadium and ejecting this material 
seems like that's exactly what they did in the jerome elementary school case and in 
fact that's what would happen almost exactly uh one year later in 1955. this next incident that 
i'd like to talk about occurred at whitsett elementary school again in elementary school 
this is in north carolina it's on october 27 1955 and everyone was out on the playground playing 
when these objects showed up the students came running inside and got the teacher 
mr lambeth and pulled him outside other teachers came out as well and saw uh eight shiny silver 
spherical shaped objects it's interesting these objects are often described as spherical 
and they were darting around and moving in all these patterns and moving across the sky  he observed them through binoculars at least 120 students were there watching this most of of the 
school and lambeth was actually a combat pilot in world war ii he had flown 46 combat missions 
so he's very familiar with aircraft and uh could not identify these things 
so as they're watching these objects sort of spit out these white bits of angel hair 
which were described as being about two to three inches in length it reminded lambeth really of 
christmas decorations is how he described it uh another witness miss newton said it covered 
acres around and reminded her of cotton candy and this is when something really interesting happened 
all the kids were running around you know picking up on these things bringing it to  the teachers well one kid reached down and scooped it up and started to eat it 
lambeth ran over to him to try to stop him but he was too late and the kid actually put this in his 
mouth and ate a sample of angel hair as far as I know this is the only person who's ever done that 
that I know of at least and the kid said it tasted bad tasted salty uh he didn't like it 
wasn't cotton candy uh so that points you know interesting to what this might actually be uh 
yeah it tasted kind of salty he said uh lambeth gathered a sample and tried to burn it with a 
match it burned easily um of course this ended school for the day everyone was sent home and 
he the principal lambeth gathered a sample and had it sent to a science lab 
burlington labs and they told him they were not able to identify it they did not know what it was 
they couldn't identify it as any known substance they thought it was biological and that it might  actually be spider webs and they suggested he send it off to a biologist so that's what he did 
he sent it to a biologist and the biologist said no this is not spider webs the 
strands were far too uniform to be spider webs and there should be evidence of spiders and since 
none of the witnesses described any spiders the biologists ruled out spider webs so the case did 
received quite a bit of publicity and in fact lambeth did receive a call from the italian 
navy who expressed a strong interest in the case at some point the united states air force 
sent over uh a representative I guess you call it who tried to actually debunk the case 
they sent over captain murray thornton and murray thornton released a statement saying 
i'm inclined to think that the silver balls were reflections of the sun on whatever the stuff was 
at higher altitudes so we couldn't explain the angel hair and tried to explain the ufos 
as silver reflections off of the whatever the stuff was clouds well lambeth wasn't having 
it he's a trained observer and had been in the military as I said and flown all these missions 
and as uh lambeth says and i'm quoting it would ease a person's mind to believe that but i'm not 
convinced it fits all the facts the silver things we saw were moving in all directions and there 
was hardly any wind or turbulence that would have moved the wispy stuff like that besides 
the teachers and the students said the objects looked too solid to be just reflections 
so again we we're just left with more questions than answers here 
one interesting end note to this case is lambeth says that he did have a sample 
which uh disappeared it's not clear if it just disappeared or stolen but as he says there was 
funny business going on so I think uh he's pretty much implying that this sample was 
taken from him at any rate there are quite a few cases and as we move on through the years 
there are more there's a case from portales new mexico which was kind of interesting this occurred 
over a period of two days october 23rd and 24th in 1957 and uh ufos were seen afterwards but not 
directly in conjunction but what's really interesting is how much substance there was 
this was a huge huge volume of angel hair there were strands that were well over 50 feet long 
and it was reported over an area of a hundred square miles so there was a lot of it in fact it 
was so thick uh farmers were having a real hard time with it they were it was interfering with 
their ability to harvest their corn fields so they were able to gather samples and the samples showed 
that it was not radioactive but did not yield any other details and again there was speculation that 
this could be spider webs because spiders are known to migrate through the sky by the way very 
large clouds of spiders have been seen so that's one of the theories that keeps getting floated 
to uh describe this stuff but I just don't think it describe you know it accounts for the evidence 
uh here's an incident which occurred in evora portugal on november 2nd 1959 two disc shaped 
objects were seen over the town and angel hair was collected in this case and analyzed 
in by microscope by a local school director and later by armed forces technicians and scientists 
at the university of lisbon so definitely as there have been cases where samples have been 
taken and studied the results weren't revealed as far as I know in that case 
but there's many other cases uh australia has a quite a few cases one occurred on august 6 1961 
and at mount hail there was at least 10 witnesses who saw 12 spherical objects silver metallic again 
it's that same silver metallic sphere that so many witnesses are describing in these cases and 
as according to one report on this case and i'm quoting the objects gave off a white substance 
which took on various shapes whilst falling to the ground I managed to pick up some of the substance 
it was a snow white color and appeared to be in a fine mesh it crumbled very easily another witness 
mrs payne says I picked up one of the streamers but it vanished in my hands as it touched my skin
so one year later almost exactly on june 6 1961 there was another australian case this 
time in new south wales six objects left a trail of quote shiny web-like filaments 
uh jean williams and her daughters witnessed it and watched it fall to the ground and actually 
disappear before hitting the ground but all over the world here's a case from entree rios province in argentina it occurred 
on january 17 1963 and the most interesting aspect of this case is that the substance 
was subjected to a chemical analysis and as researcher brian boldman 
an angel hair expert says and i'm quoting a formation passed over entree rios and observers 
recovered vitreous particles that had fallen from them these particles were found to be an almagamb 
of silicon boron calcium and magnesium just the same as has been found in similar circumstances 
in other parts of the world so yeah it's these same four substances silicon boron calcium 
and magnesium so whatever the answers are to angel hair obviously lies in that direction 
uh so here's another australian case on august 29 1969 this was in grafton again in new south wales 
a witness a surfer saw this angel hair just roll falling down out of the sky he didn't see any ufos 
but did later find out that there were sightings earlier in the area so sometimes it takes a long 
time for this stuff to fall down it can fall down for an hour following a ufo sighting or longer 
and as this witness says and i'm quoting I began rolling up copious amounts of the material in my 
hands the filaments diminished in size and then the material eventually dissipated into 
nothing visible and leaving no trace it gave the impression of rapid sublimation from solid to gas 
but no vapors or odors were noticed he quickly ran home and got some glass jars and ran back to 
the scene of the location but by the time you got back there was no trace of the angel hair 
another australian case occurred at maslins beach this is in south australia occurred on 
march 15 1971. again there was numerous objects the witnesses uh who saw the angel hair in this 
case described it as quote fairy floss at any rate they again said weren't able to save a 
sample because it melted upon contact so this these cases move all the way into modern times 
uh some years later february 10 1978 a large number of these angel hair fibers 
fell from the sky for a period of over two hours this was in new zealand near the uh town of maru 
another australian case 1998 um pretty recently eunice stanfield and noline mosettic were two 
witnesses they saw numerous silvery spheres again they counted about 20 of these objects 
and they ejected this weird angel hair as one of the witnesses noline says it was extremely 
light whitish and strong like cotton requiring a good tug to break so it's interesting that this 
substance can dissolve so quickly and yet often witnesses describe it as being pretty durable 
and strong another australian case is fairly recent august 5th the year 2000 this is at 
old nora lunga australia multiple witnesses in different locations uh saw the silvery ufo 
and it ejected this material one guy said it covered his house his yard his fence 
another group of witnesses were on the beach that covered the beach or another man he was in  his house and he he saw it coming towards his house and he first thought it was a fog bank 
until it actually came and started draping itself all over his house and yard 
and again just stayed there for a short while and disappeared must be a very interesting sight to 
see so yeah there are modern cases and we do have some cases reaching back or in early history so 
it appears that this is a phenomenon that has been going on for perhaps millennia one of the earliest 
cases I could find occurred in 1833 in rahway new jersey when people reported seeing what they 
thought were meteors in the sky except following this sighting of meteors people also saw what they 
described as a gelatinous material or lumps of jelly falling from the sky one witness described 
it as quote the coagulated white of an egg so this fell over a wide area actually witnesses in newark 
new jersey saw it as well and described it as a soft soapy like substance and in west point new 
york people saw it and they described it as being similar to quote boiled starch so this actually 
did make the newspapers and was well publicized and as witnesses told the newspaper reporters 
the substance evaporated very quickly and very easily another very early case occurred on 
november 21st in 1898 in montgomery alabama when reportedly large quantities of the substance fell 
it was described again as being very spider web like but reminded people of asbestos and also seem 
to have a phosphorescent quality to it sort of a shiny quality which again we hear in other cases 
and another possible incident of angel hair and perhaps the most widely viewed in history would be 
the fatima incident in fatima portugal on august 1917. and this is a very well-known incident i've 
talked about it uh in other of my videos and it involved three young girls who had a apparition 
of what appeared to be the virgin mary or the lady of fatima as they called her who gave her prophet 
gave them prophecies and promised to display and people started to gather and actually saw 
amazing things happened on the second day of the event there was more than 18 000 people 
who had gathered to watch and many of the witnesses described 
what appears to be angel hair they described it as quote falling flowers or petals 
or flakes but on the third day of this whole incident the crowd had grown to 
more than thirty thousand and uh again we saw a wide range of phenomena ufos and uh 
angel hair apparently and one witness actually left a pretty detailed description as he says 
and i'm quoting as the people stared at this strange sight they soon noticed that the falling 
glistening gob globules contrary to the laws of perspective grow smaller and smaller as they near 
them and when they reach out their hands and hats to catch them they find that they have melted away 
so yeah this sounds very much like angel hair as jacques valet pointed out 
this quote religious miracle uh which was it was widely believed to be at the time has many of the 
elements of a ufo encounter including angel hair so those are the angel hair cases and it's pretty 
interesting and there's been quite a bit of study on this I collected all these cases uh in my book 
not from here volume two because I find them so fascinating I did kind of a study on them 
but I have to tell you this this uh phenomena has been researched in depth by a number of 
accomplished researchers who have some very interesting insights into it 
for example jerome clarke and lauren coleman remarked upon angel hairs sort of similarities 
to a substance we know as ectoplasm ectoplasm is a substance that's sort of reportedly 
emitted from mediums psychic mediums and used to form apparitions it's a very wispy 
amorphous cloud-like substance which apparently does have some similarities i'm not sure if it's 
the same thing but as jerome clark and lauren coleman write and i'm quoting certainly people 
are reporting something sometimes it spews forth various materials which invariably prove 
to be conventional earthly substances the sole exception is the mysterious angel hair which like 
the ectoplasm of spiritualist literature to which it is apparently related to since disintegrates 
within a very short time consequently no one has ever been able to study it carefully 
uh well now we have actually been able to study it but at the time there was a lot of  speculation about what this was in fact pioneering ufo researcher harold t wilkins who has written a 
number of books about the phenomena uh was well aware of it of angel hair and ufos and as he 
writes i'm quoting is it jettisoned to sterilize the air or render radioactive fallout innocuous 
has it any connection with their propulsion in our atmosphere and this seems to be the main theory 
there are two main theories one is spider webs because as as I said there are clouds of spiders 
which have been seen in the stars and spider webs can fall in very large quantities but I think 
researchers have pretty much ruled out spider webs because spider webs do not dissolve upon contact 
and don't have a huge static charge usually and aren't formed by ufos they're formed by spiders 
and it just doesn't account for the fact that this stuff has been directly tied to ufos so most 
researchers believe it has something to do with ufo propulsion and the fact that these vehicles uh 
have sort of a perhaps a plasma field surrounding them uh one researcher who has looked into this is 
aim michelle a pioneering french researcher who's written a number of books and investigated cases 
such as the oleron case in france and as he writes the nature of this material is a complete mystery 
is angel hair to be considered as something intentional or is it produced accidentally 
should the production of the substance be cited as a highly significant performance by a ufo 
or should we regard it merely as something like the ice that forms on an airplane's wings at 
high altitude we might imagine that under some conditions the means of propulsion used by the 
saucers can produce a polymerization of atoms of the surrounding atmosphere forming a sort of high 
molecular weight plastic that solidifies in filaments this could be thought of as 
a peculiar and unstable sort of atmospheric ice which can crystallize out of the cold upper air 
only under the unusual conditions existing in the vicinity of a flying saucer when the 
substance falls to the ground normal warmth would soon depolymerize it and release the atoms in 
their original gaseous state so that in the end there would remain nothing but the ordinary gases 
of the atmosphere this would explain the futility of the chemical analysis attempted up to this time
of course now we have had chemical analysis uh and we'll get a little bit more into that in just a 
second but a michelle really owes his speculations to a true pioneer of the ufo propulsion 
who is lieutenant jean plantier i'm also from france who wrote a book about ufos and his 
theories on ufo propulsion and his theories seem to have held valid because he predicted a number 
of things such as when ufos are photographed they often appear to be not completely 
symmetrical and will have an off-center spot and he also predicted other details 
apparently including angel hair and uh as according to plantier and i'm gonna just uh 
quote aim michelle here because amy schell is paraphrasing lieutenant gene plontier quote the 
ionization of the atmosphere in the wake of the craft would be sufficient because of the colossal 
intensity of the field to produce ultra heavy positive particles which in contact with molecules 
of oxygen nitrogen water etc of the surrounding air would exhibit novel chemical reactions 
the product of these reactions the famous angel's hair would disintegrate as the ionization 
disappeared so yeah we know it's not spider webs and I think uh lieutenant plantier was on to 
the right track here uh could be that what we're dealing with is really nothing more than sort of 
a weird byproduct of these ufo engines I mentioned brian boldman before he's one of the leading 
researchers into angel hair he wrote an article called an analysis of angel hair 
from 1947 to the year 2000 and devotes much of the article to proving that this substance is not 
spiderwebs as he says it is a genuine constituent of the ufo phenomenon and worthy of study and 
he's really focused on the very few chemical analyses that have been done of angel hair 
and as brian boldman says and I quote it is interesting that in multiple cases 
widespread in time and location the same elements were detected 
silicon calcium magnesium and boron angel hair has been called a borosilicate glass due 
to these constituents while silicon calcium and magnesium are common elements in the earth's crust 
boron is not it constitutes only three tenths parts per million of the crust 
making it relatively rare why it should turn up in these samples from three different continents 
years apart is unknown boron absorbs neutrons and is used to shield and control nuclear reactions 
adding to the speculation that angel hair is a byproduct of a nuclear propulsion system 
other elements found in angel hair include potassium silicon calcium phosphorus aluminum 
oxygen chlorine iron sulfur manganese potassium sodium zinc lanthanum cesium 
and tritium so whatever this substance is it's clearly not naturally forming if it has all these 
elements and substances in them so that alone is very interesting I find the whole boron
particularly interesting and the fact that it is used with  nuclear materials so perhaps that provides a little bit of an insight into what this stuff is 
paul hill is a pioneering ufo researcher who is one of a few early scientists to study ufos 
he wrote the scientific study of ufos a very interesting book and as he writes when we know 
or suspect that a substance is a complicated molecular compound it is very little knowledge 
to know that some of the atomic constituents are boron silicon calcium and magnesium if this 
analysis were valid angel hair would resemble fine wire and would not sublime at ambient temperatures 
among other things the negative valence atoms are missing from this formulation what is needed is an 
analysis the molecular composition so that we will know the molecular compounds which form angel hair 
so this still leaves us at somewhat of a dead end as to what exactly this is and how exactly it's 
formed uh but there has been some interesting experiments that point towards this being sort 
of a byproduct of ufo engine scientists have produced what appears to be a similar substance 
using uh magnets and superconductors and they can produce these fine filaments though they 
haven't been able to uh produce them to the point where they remain for any length of time 
so is it exhaust possibly it's very hard to say uh I find that very curious because it is so 
darn rare when you consider the huge number of cases uh there should be a lot more cases 
involving angel hair than there are I mean we've got hundreds of thousands of 
sightings and what only a handful of angel hair cases um that's hard to reconcile perhaps the 
conditions are very rare but people are seeing these on normal bright sunny days 
so it's hard to say whether there's any special weather conditions that uh are causing this 
or whether it's a factor of the ufo itself and another thing I find interesting is that at least 
three of these appear to be outright displays and i'm wondering if they ejected this angel hair 
over that stadium in italy over jerome elementary school or whitsett elementary school on purpose 
is this intentional I think any answer would be pure speculation at this point but it does 
definitely appear to be connected to their very powerful engines and whatever the explanation 
it does provide sort of an interesting little insight into the nature of the ufo phenomena and 
i think that alone makes it important and that's why I wanted to do this video at any rate I hope 
uh you've enjoyed it thanks very much for watching I really appreciate it and please keep having fun
