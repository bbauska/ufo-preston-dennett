THE MUDDY MAN
Mar 25, 2022

Summary:
Mar 25, 2022
In 1963, the Sanz family moved into their new home in Arleta, California. The two daughters, Karen (age 6) and Susan (age 2) shared a room. One evening, Karen awoke to an incredible shock: a strange boogie-man-like figure emerged from the closet, floated across the room and went to her little sister's crib. She watched in fear as the short, big-eyed creature poked its hand through the bars of the crib. Fearing that Susan was going to be taken away, Karen tried to get up. Instead, she found herself falling asleep. That was the first visit from the muddy man. But it wasn't the last. 

Soon the muddy man returned. A week or two later, Karen woke up, and watched again as this same creature appeared and went directly to Susan's crib. It looked at Karen, but once more remained by Susan's crib. Despite trying to stay awake, Karen fell asleep. When it happened a third time a week later, Karen told her parents. "You're just having a nightmare," they told her.

But Karen knew it wasn't a nightmare. She was awake. And it kept happening. Week after week, month after month, this muddy man kept appearing, always going to Susan's crib. No matter how hard she tried, Karen could not stay awake. Unable to convince her parents, Karen had nobody to talk to about it. 

Years passed, but the visits continued, soon mounting into the hundreds. Always, the weird creature emerged from the closet area, and went directly to Susan. Even when they re-arranged the positions of the beds, it was always the same. The muddy man seemed only interested in Susan.

Unknown to Karen, Susan had also begun to see the muddy man. She was now old enough to realize that something was wrong, and that whoever or whatever this figure was, it wasn't human. It was short, bald, with a huge head and large dark, wraparound eyes. After several such visits, Susan (like Karen had) told her parents about what was happening. Again, her parents assumed it was a nightmare.

One time, Susan saw the figure appear in the closet holding a strange black box. And standing next to the figure was Susan's mother. Except it wasn't her mother. Instead, Susan was convinced it was something else, a disguise. Like Karen, Susan was never able to stay awake.

More weird events occurred. Susan would sometimes hear her name being called in her head, over and over, "Susan! Susan! Susan!" Another time, the family went to visit Zuma Beach. Susan was in the water when she became disoriented and felt like she was being dragged away. There was a strange unexplained shift, and she found herself in a different location. Looking back in hindsight, she realizes this was a classic case of missing time.

At the time, neither Karen nor Susan had ever heard of aliens or extraterrestrials. Neither of them had ever seen a UFO, so they had no idea how to interpret what was happening to them. 

Then, in 1969, after six years, the visitations abruptly ended. Things began to return back to normal. Susan, however, was left with anxiety. Certain big-eyed cartoon characters sent chills down her spine. She began dreaming about UFOs hovering over her house.

But it wasn't until 1988, when Karen and Susan (now adults) returned home for Thanksgiving that they reminisced about their childhood and began to connect to the dots. Susan told her sister that she used to have weird waking nightmares about a creature that would emerge from the closet. "The Muddy Man!" Karen said. "I saw it too!" Only then did they realize that they had been seeing the same thing. And when images of gray aliens began to appear on television, they finally had their answer about what the creature was. It was a gray alien.

Susan was shocked, and reading about UFOs, she was amazed to see how closely their experiences matched those of other people. The only thing was, they had never seen a UFO. But that was about to change. Just a few years later, Susan's five-year-old daughter reported seeing a "little boy" in her bedroom. That was when the unexplained nosebleeds began. And weird scoop marks on their bodies.

In 1991, Karen went back home to live with her parents. To her shock, the muddy man came for another visit.

One year later, in 1992, Susan woke up one morning to see a UFO landing in her backyard. Several gray aliens emerged. They were angry. Susan had agreed to go on television in a few days to talk about her encounters. The ETs made it clear, they didn't want her to go public. Susan cancelled her TV appearance.

But soon the UFOs were back, and this time Susan's husband Hector was a witness. This video presents the true story of a long and complex series of UFO contacts that changed the lives of two sisters forever. It reveals many of the patterns of UFO contact.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
i call this episode the muddy man this is the story of two sisters 
karen and susan sands who experienced a series of really remarkable visitations throughout their 
childhood susan later as an adult would have more encounters so she was apparently the target of 
these visitations it's a very interesting ufo contact story with some interesting things to 
say about the ufo phenomenon and that's why I wanted to present this case to you today 
their story begins in 1963 in arlita california the sans family had just purchased a new house 
and karen and susan shared a room karen was six years old and susan was only two years old 
and it was karen who noticed this visitation first this strange figure coming into their bedroom 
and it was always the same thing this figure would appear often from the closet area and move over to 
susan's crib and stand over the crib and I'll just let karen describe in her own words how this all 
started as karen says I used to always be afraid of what I called the muddy man 
he always used to go over to my little sister susie's bed and he always used to come up to 
her crib and stick his hand in he floated off the ground he was about three or four feet tall bald 
and he was always drippy he always went over to my little sister's bed 
every time I saw him he would come over and he would look over at me and then he would go to 
the foot of the bed of my little sister and I was always afraid that he was going to get 
her or take her away and I would just try to stay awake because I thought he was going to hurt her 
i was awake I was always awake I'm sure because that was one of the things I was afraid to go 
to sleep because I thought he would take her I don't know why but I always thought 
he would take susan so this went on over and over again karen did tell her parents 
but her parents didn't believe that this was real and told her she was just having nightmares 
but karen knew these were not nightmares she was awake and this happened on a weekly basis 
over a period of years over and over again it was always the same thing this muddy 
man would appear from the closet area usually and go over to karen's crib and stand over it 
as karen says I remember a lot of times he'd put his little hand out on her bed and I think it had 
only three little fingers he never had a full hand it was always bony and I remember it was dripping 
and floating I usually didn't see any arms or legs it had a very tall forehead you know when I first 
heard people talking about extraterrestrials and I saw that picture of the communion people 
it looked like him except he had a much much taller forehead more bulbous his eyes were big and 
went around the side of his head he had a neck and it was bony I never really saw anything because he 
was always covered in darkness he was always wet I never actually saw his torso or his legs all 
i remember mostly is his shoulders being bony his arms and the rest just hovering so as I said this 
figure usually would come from the closet area and as the years passed it just kept appearing on 
a weekly basis so this was hundreds and hundreds of times it didn't always go to the crib sometimes 
it would just come in and check on them like peering into their room from the closet area 
and I'll just let karen describe again one of these incidents particularly where it was peering 
out of the closet as karen says he would sometimes come out and he would be surveying or looking 
around and then he would disappear but most of the time he always seemed to have a purpose which was 
go to the foot of my sister's bed and during us growing up my sister's bed was at different places 
there was one point where my sister's bed was next to mine another time it was across the room 
and another time when it was in the corner but he always went there so at this time of course susan 
was getting older and older this started when susan was two years old she doesn't remember 
that far back but it was around age four five or six that she absolutely does remember this muddy 
man figure coming over her bed and staring at her the first really clear incident occurred she's 
guessing around age five or six and I'll just let susan describe in her own words what this was like 
as she says my first recollection is waking up and I'm positive that I was awake and that 
it wasn't a dream I don't even know why I woke up but there seemed to be a reason for it I looked up 
and he was sitting on my bed leaning forward just looking at me I don't remember any actual 
features but I do remember the shape of him very clearly it was dark but he was shaped like 
those aliens you see that's the only way to describe it he was very very thin and short 
i could tell it was a short little person and my first thought was that it was a burglar 
my second thought was no he doesn't look right these thoughts came in like a split second he had 
a thin body I didn't see any feet or hands in those split seconds I was so terrified 
i went to scream and nothing would come out and immediately I had this feeling of needing to sleep 
and I pulled the covers over my head and I went into what I call a severe sleep I remember 
feeling like I had been drugged like karen susan went and told her parents and again 
her parents did not believe her told her she must be having nightmares and susan remembers several 
incidents she doesn't remember the hundreds like karen does but she does remember several times 
that this happened and she never really got a good look because it was really frightening to her I 
can understand this because they were coming for her and karen was able to get a better look at it 
because I feel like she had less fear of this because they weren't coming for her directly 
but this was absolutely terrifying for susan and like karen susan saw 
that they were coming from the closet area and she developed a real big fear of closets 
this is quite common among contactees by the way I'm beginning to think these ets use closets as 
kind of the portal area a good place to come in and out of perhaps because they know they 
won't be disturbed in there I don't know but it's a feature that turns up in a lot of cases 
so this continued quite a bit one incident that susan does remember was very strange 
she doesn't even like to talk about it because it's so strange but she did agree to tell 
me about it and I'll just let her describe it in her own words again she saw these et's coming out 
of the closet and as susan says and I quote I'd gotten up to go to the bathroom this is a very 
odd one and it sounds so ridiculous that you just don't say it I went to the bathroom and came back 
and the closet door was open and the light was on and there he was in there with what I call 
a mottled face something like that and I won't say that my mother was in there with him but I 
felt like it was a clone of my mother I really do like it was something made up for me to see 
and she was folding things and putting them in a special drawer 
that I don't think even existed in the closet and then he turned to me with a little gray box 
and showed it to me kind of nodding like I knew something and then put it back in this 
drawer I went back to bed I didn't think or say anything I can't remember I remember being scared 
but that didn't seem to last I got back into bed and I went back into sleep 
so susan did get a good look at the figures this time and she describes them very much like 
we think of as gray aliens but again at this time they weren't thinking aliens at all they had never 
seen a ufo never thought about ufos this wasn't really being popularized in the media at this time 
so they had no idea what was going on they just called it the muddy man but yeah it's probably a 
grey alien as we would think of and I'll just let susan describe in her own words what this 
figure looked like as she says I just remember black eyes and he had a uniform on his body 
it was dark blue and had a little triangle right here below the front collar that's all I remember 
and the little gray box about as big as a clock radio a rectangle featureless like a shoe box this 
is really interesting to me because this black box or gray box is something I've heard in a 
number of other cases I'm not sure what it means uh in fact there's quite a bit of speculation 
about this within the ufo community I don't know but it's something I've heard many times 
so this again was something that went on for years from about 1963 to 1969 six years at 
which point it suddenly stopped there were a few odd incidents during this time susan remembers 
her name being called telepathically over and over again susan susan susan it really freaked her out 
after it happened two or three times she actually considered that she might be going insane 
thankfully it didn't happen a lot but definitely happened enough to cause her some anxiety so susan 
was having some real uh issues with dealing with this she remembers watching the popeye cartoons 
and in the popeye cartoons there was a character called alice the goon this sent shivers down her 
spine because this figure reminded her of these this muddy man and she thought to herself why the 
heck do they put these this figure in children's cartoons it scared the daylights out of her 
she also had dreams about aliens she remembers one dream where this muddy man came up to her and was 
talking to her and she couldn't understand it and she said to it what are you trying to tell 
me and he replied we can't explain another dream which repeated over and over again I think it's 
pretty significant she dreamt that she and her family rushed outside and there was lots of 
people outside and susan knew the ufos were coming and sure enough this ufo appears over her house 
and susan points to it and says very excitedly here they are isn't it wonderful 
so this was not fearful for her she was pretty excited to see these et's coming 
and I think this is significant because this is a dream or a variation of a dream I 
hear from a lot of contactees I think it's pointing towards the possibility that one day 
this sort of thing will happen I don't know but it's a dream that I've heard enough 
that I think it's important to mention one more incident I'd like to mention real quickly 
was as a teenager or young child preteen susan had an experience at zuma beach which is again 
in southern california she had gone there to visit with her family following this incident 
she hated going to the beach now she knows why because she thinks she had a visitation 
she was out in the water became disoriented had a period of missing time 
and found herself in a different position and I'll just let susan describe what happened as she says 
i was out in the ocean I was very small just standing there having the waves come 
in and what have you and I can't remember I feel like I went into an unconscious state 
like there was a period of time there that is missing and all of a sudden when 
i did open my eyes I was waist high in the water and I started to cry and get upset 
karen came and dragged me out of the water through the sand I was hysterical I remember feeling like 
oh my god like I was being dragged somewhere I mean into the water not out of it and it 
really frightened me and I always thought it was an odd thing but I didn't connect it 
to this until karen told me about the muddy man incidents so what happened was in uh 1988 karen 
and susan returned home for a thanksgiving celebration by this point they were grown up 
they had moved out of the house susan got married to a gentleman by the name of hector 
and they had come back for thanksgiving in 1988 and started reminiscing about their childhood 
and susan mentioned these incidents where she saw this figure the muddy man 
bending over her crib or her bed and looking at her and karen turned to her wide-eyed and said 
oh my god I remember that I saw that too and as they compared details they realized that they were 
seeing the exact same thing they turned to their parents and their parents remembered them both 
coming in and talking about it so they confirmed that this did in fact happen so following this 
discussion susan's anxieties really ramped up and she started having a real fear of this subject 
and thinking about what had happened to her as a child started looking into ufo books they started 
connecting this two ufos at this time because by this time images of grays were appearing 
in the media and that's when they realized oh my gosh this could be gray aliens it really threw 
them off because they had never seen a ufo at least not yet that would soon happen however 
so susan started to read books on ufos well she tried but they were too scary so she put them away 
and just tried to put this out of her life meanwhile in 1991 karen was changing her residence 
and decided to come back and stay at her parents for a short period of time and she moved back into 
her old room where she had seen this muddy man and she had only been there a few days 
when the muddy man came back for another visit completely freaked her out and again I'll just 
let karen describe this in her own words and mind you she's an adult now as karen says I saw 
the same exact muddy man come out again and I had not even thought about the muddy man or anything 
i saw that shape and I couldn't go back to sleep I was scared I was petrified and I kept thinking 
that I was coming over and doing the exact same thing it always did I'd sit in bed to look closer 
and it would just kind of move back into the shadows so she called up her little sister susan 
and told her about it probably not a good idea because that freaked susan out even more and 
this is when susan had another encounter in fact a series of encounters it was one year later in 1992 
it's susan was in her bedroom when her little six-year-old daughter came running in and said 
mommy mommy I just saw a little boy in my room and susan immediately thought back to the muddy 
man and credit to her she didn't tell her daughter it was just a nightmare she just comforted her as 
best as she could and following this her daughter started to suffer from a series of pretty severe 
and unexplained nosebleeds this is something that susan had learned was a possible symptom 
of ufo close encounters so it freaked her out caused her even more anxiety to realize that her 
child might be going through the same thing she had gone through as a child and she got further 
confirmation of this when one day she was with her daughter and saw a little scar on her leg a scoop 
mark this freaked her out because susan had the same exact looking scar in the same exact place 
she asked her daughter about it where did this come from and her 
daughter had no idea so this provided further confirmation for susan a year later in 1993 
i asked susan if she would consider going on television to talk about her encounters this was 
just a tiny little public access tv station not a big tv show but susan happily agreed she wanted to 
talk about this and to help get over her fears but it was just a few days before we were due to go 
uh shoot this television program when susan called me up and said no I'm not doing it 
i said why what's wrong she says well the grays came and they do not want me to go on tv 
so I asked her what happened and she described a really incredible encounter at this time she 
was living in north hollywood it was an early morning in february she woke up walked into 
the living room her daughter was watching cartoons was completely entranced hypnotized watching these 
cartoons and looking out in the backyard susan was shocked to see a ufo coming in for a landing 
said it was really strange because it was cylindrical shaped it's vertical it had a rounded 
top a flat bottom with little fins kind of like a rocket and it came in for a landing and as she 
watched a small group of four maybe five et's came out and started walking towards her so it was very 
strange because they were wearing trench coats and holding what looked like suitcases or perhaps 
these little gray boxes that she had seen before I'll just let susan describe in her own words 
what happened these aliens start to get out of the ship about four or five of them I can't remember 
the exact number but they were wearing what looks like trench coats and they were carrying something 
i don't know if it's a briefcase if it's a box something I'm not sure 
i know they're upset I know that they're angry that's clear to me 
i don't recall any communication going on but the message of anger was very clear and I got 
very upset became frantic hysterical I got to the point where tears were just streaming down my face 
then after that I black out I mean I just black out everything is dark then I wake up 
my cat is very close to my face growling with his hair standing on end and his eyes 
wide open looking at the door I wake up petrified and then I'm scared the entire day 
not knowing why as she meditate on this she got the message that the et's did not want her 
to go on tv that they did not want people to know about them did not want them 
to know that she was having encounters so she calls me up and says I'm not going on tv 
of course I said that's fine uh that's you know I'm perfectly okay with that your well-being is 
really paramount so she did not go on tv and it was just a short time after that 
that there was another visitation susan did not see this one this time it was her 
husband hector who woke up and saw this really bright light shining in through 
the window and I will just let hector describe this in his own words as hector says 
this encompassed the whole window did you ever see the movie blade runner with harrison ford 
that's the only way I can describe it where he's in his apartment and his blimp comes by 
and shines a light real quick into his room like that it seemed like a searchlight going by 
going by the window and lighting up everything in the room 
it was like a lighthouse type effect you know the light coming around and lighting up everything 
in the room for a split second and then just going away dark and coming back again so he knew 
instantly what was going on he thought to himself oh this is susan's aliens don't take me take her 
that's what he thought he felt a little bit guilty about it but this is what came to his mind 
and normally he said he would have gotten up and checked it out but he did not react that way as 
he says and I quote I felt like I was scared to get up for some reason it was unusual because 
normally I would get up and wonder what was going on this time it was like I was hesitant to get up 
of actually taking the covers and getting out of bed because I knew that there was something wrong 
but it was okay and I felt like I was thinking to myself I know who it is or saying to them I know 
who you are and I know why you're here just let me go back to sleep that's kind of the feeling I had 
like I didn't want to be bothered but again normally I would have gotten up like what's 
going on so the hector's reaction surprised himself and he told his wife susan about it and 
of course she had more anxieties about it this is not something she's happy about she doesn't feel 
like these et's are here to hurt her or anything but she does feel that it causes her some anxiety 
so she has trouble with it and this is really where their encounters end or at least where 
they stopped for that point up to that time I did eventually lose contact with them so I don't know 
if their encounters continued or not I suspect that they did I did cover their case in my book 
1 in 40 the ufo epidemic and I think it's a very interesting case for a number of reasons 
there's that weird black box which turns up in so many cases the alien dream that's very 
common among contactees I also find it interesting that this these visitations went on for six years 
and they never connected it to ets because they had never seen a ufo so yeah there's some very 
interesting elements one thing that they did think was significant was that their house was located 
right next to the wash the la river perhaps that explains why they described this figure as 
being wet or drippy I don't know that's another unusual detail that I certainly haven't heard 
a lot so yeah it's a very interesting case with some very interesting elements to it I hope 
you've enjoyed this episode I think it has some interesting things to say about the ufo phenomena 
but that's it for now I want to thank you once again for watching I truly appreciate it and until 
next time keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
