Summary:
Jun 21, 2024
The time for skepticism is over. There are too many cases to ignore, too much evidence to deny. This video presents ten true cases of firsthand extraterrestrial encounters from across the globe, each providing important information and profound insights into the UFO phenomenon. Many have multiple witnesses and compelling evidence in the form of landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and physiological effects. It’s time for all humanity to accept the truth of the ET presence on Earth.

THE UFO GOBLINS. On the morning of March 15, 1943, sisters “C,” (10) and Angela (6) were grazing the family goat by their home in the small town of Montecreste, Italy. Suddenly a “great roar” overhead caught their attention and they saw a saucer-shaped craft land nearby. Two figures in white jumpsuits exited and talked in a weird language. Knowing nothing of UFOs and ETs, the girls thought they saw goblins.

FOUR ALIENS IN THE BACKYARD. At 2am on October 13, 1975, Mayme H awoke to her dog barking. Looking outside her home in Alton, Illinois, she saw a 3½-foot-tall humanoid in a silver jumpsuit in her backyard. Moments later, it was joined by three others, and all four ran single-file into the forest behind her home. The next morning, they found a circle of crushed grass in a field not far from the location.

HIGHWAY HUMANOID. At 9:45 pm, January 26, 1976, Claude Cretin was driving between Madilly-Mandelot and Bouze-les-Beaune in France when a flash of light blinded him. A short distance ahead, he saw a tall humanoid in a fluorescent red bodysuit and helmet with a face-mask standing by the road. He drove off in fear and went to the police. Returning to the site the next morning, they found broken branches 10-15 feet high.

THE MEN FROM THE STAR. Just past midnight on January 28, 1976, Miguel Fernandez Carrasco was walking to his home in Benacazon, Spain when a star-like object approached. Suddenly it landed next to him. It was a strange craft. Two 7-foot-tall humanoids exited and approached. Miguel ran in fear. The humanoids went back into the craft and then followed him from above, sending down a beam of light, causing Miguel to pass out. He awoke two hours later in front of his home, with strange marks on his body. 

ANOTHER FLYING HUMANOID. At 5:00 am on April 7, 1977, former politician Cyril John saw light flood his home in Milford Haven, Wales. Looking out the window, he saw an oval-shaped craft hovering 200 feet away. Then he saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid wearing a silver-gray suit, hovering just 35 feet away. He watched both object and humanoid for the next half-hour until they slowly moved off into the distance.

AN ALIEN MEETING. On the afternoon of Sep 27, 1978, Henryk Marciniak took his motorcycle to a wooded area outside Kanin, Poland to pick edible mushrooms. Suddenly he saw a metallic craft landed in a clearing. Two short humanoids in black jumpsuits exited and approached him. They had greenish-skin, webbed hands, and large bulging eyes. They showed interest in both his motorcycle and the mushrooms, then took off in their craft.

RIGHT OVER THE CAR. At 5:30 pm on Nov 13, 1982, two men driving to Port Wakefield in South Australia saw an object pacing their car. Suddenly it was right overhead and looking up, they saw right into the front of the craft. They could see several humanoids inside and all kinds of weird equipment. Frightened, they panicked and drove off. Soon other people in the area began to report UFOs.

100 LITTLE ALIENS. At 5:45 pm on October 28, 1985, a dozen children were playing outside their homes in Honefoss, Norway when a UFO appeared overhead and seemed to land. As it disappeared, they suddenly saw a huge crowd of tiny humanoids running around. They were dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. For the next two hours, they ran around the area, causing some children to flee in panic. Later strange footprints were found. 

THE ALIENS IN THE BUSHES. One afternoon in Oct 1986, farmer Alberto Meyer was shocked to see two 5-foot-tall humanoids emerge from the brush near his home in Viale, Entre Rios, Argentina. They had huge hairless heads, small facial features, and wore skintight jumpsuits. One seemed to smile at Alberto as they returned to the brush. Later, a footprint was found and photographed. More UFOs were soon seen.

HUMANOIDS ABOVE A CITY STREET. At 9pm on Jan 19, 1991, Helge F walked along Markt Street in Ronneburg, Germany when a powerful wind struck her. Looking up, she saw a craft 100 feet overhead. It tilted toward her, revealing three strange humanoids inside. Helge found herself waving at them. One pointed a strange rod at her. The craft moved off. Helge found she was missing about 15 minutes of time.

These ten cases are a tiny portion of the actual number of cases, each of which provide further evidence that we are not alone, that ETs are visiting our planet. The truth can no longer be denied. They are here.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal going to talk
about some more humanoids I think this is the most important aspect of this subject certainly has the most to teach
us and it's endlessly fascinating today's episode is called they are here
10 Close Encounters with extraterrestrials again I've chosen cases from all over the world including
France whes Spain Italy Germany Norway
Poland as well as Australia and the United
States now these cases do date all the way back to the 1940s up to the 1990s
I'm going to go through them chronologically and yeah many of them involve multiple Witnesses some really
remarkable physical evidence in a number of these cases so many cases I still get
Skeptics telling me where's the evidence well it's here and honestly and I've said it before it's the huge number of
cases that really I think provides the best evidence so many cases coming from all over the world with really
incredible commonalities and similarities and also some really interesting unique
aspects so all different types of humanoids let's just get started in the
first case I'd like to talk about today I call the UFO goblins this is a really
interesting case I like it because it's quite early well before the idea of
extraterrestrials was really in the popular culture it occurred on March 15
1943 in Monte creste Italy this is a very small community and there are two
witnesses and it's quite an interesting encounter this very early case appeared
the Italian UFO magazine Rista D informasion eup it took place again in Monte creste
which is north of Novara Italy this is a very small commune Community located in
a rural mountainous area and the two witnesses in this case were young girls
sisters known only as Angela who was 6 years old at the time and her older
sister age 10 who we only know by her initial C
the two of them were grazing their goat not far from their home when they both heard a quote great Roar a kind of
Rumble which reminded them of an approaching rainstorm it was coming from above and looking up in fear they saw a
strange quote ship coming down it came down quite quickly and
landed just a short distance away from them on a rocky slope this object they said was saucer shaped it had a clear
Dome on top and inside the Dome they could see two quote strange people or
little men who were sitting on these tiny seats this object was not very
large they estimate about 10 ft long now Angela again this younger sister was
quite frightened by the object but her older sister became curious and walked
up to this object approaching it and it looked to them kind of like a helicopter
but there were no propellers was sort of a metallic green in color there was a
bright light source shining from the right edge of the craft this tiny little light now Angela wanted to hide but
there was nothing to hide behind in this area and very quickly the two little men
who were inside the craft came out of it and stood next to it started to babble in this incomprehensible language and
Angela's sister walked right up to them and tried to speak to these figures and they to her apparently she did not
understand him these beings were very short they looked human or quote similar
to us and they were dressed in quote a white suit with a kind of
helmet so Angela's sister interacted briefly with these beings and Angela
looked away for just a second and looked back and the next thing she knew the craft and these little beings were gone
she did not see it actually depart they were just gone very quickly so now
seeing that they had left Angela approached her sister and asked her what happened and her sister was very calm
and said only not to worry that they were quote two goblins or
fairies so again the idea of extraterrestrials did not occur to
either of them but they had heard of course of goblins and fairies which are
a major part of European folklore So This Is How They interpreted their encounter at least for many years
interestingly their goat did not show any reaction to the UFO or the humanoids
and Upon returning home the two sisters did not talk about it to anybody for years only as an adult hearing about UFO
encounters did Angela finally understand what happened to her and she told only
her own family what happened and then later of course researchers there are so
many cases like this one where a UFO appears drops down out of the sky lands
humanoids come out and just have a very short meeting with whoever happens to be
lucky enough to be there and witness this I'm glad it's a multiple witness
case that always adds a level of credibility but this one is super fascinating because yes it's so early
that the witnesses themselves had never thought of UFOs or the idea of extraterrestrials and kind of
interpreted these beings as being goblins or fairies or something along those lines and only later decided that
this was probably extraterrestrial G given that there were so many other cases like theirs being
reported Now we move to another Super interesting case I like this one it was
very well investigated and I call this one four aliens in the
backyard this occurred on October 13 19 75 in Alton
Illinois and it's got some interesting evidence in terms of possible Landing traces but absolutely some corroborating
accounts which support it there's something very strange going on in this community given how many cases there are
occurring in Alton Illinois this case was originally published in skylook the
January 1976 issue this is the publication of the mut UFO Network and
the case was investigated by researcher David schro the
witness is m h and she had seen her husband off to
work he worked the night shift he left it around 11:00 p.m. on October 12th
1975 and then M went to bed in her home in Alton Illinois and it was around 2
a.m. she was woken up by the sound of her dog barking in a quote vicious tone
that she had never heard him bark before so that was weird she speculated that
perhaps there was a raccoon or a fox disturbing the garbage this had happened
before she lived on a dark Street and there was a natural forested area behind
her house they had no fence to keep Critters away so this is what she was thinking and she got up without turning
on the lights in her bedroom and looked up out of her second story window and this is when she got an incredible shock
she saw what she first thought was a silver wolf running on two legs from the back of her house at a diagonal towards
the woods but it clearly was not a wolf as it was undeniably a humanoid figure
and I'll just let M describe in her own words as she says I was trying to
rationalize when it turned and looked directly at me or towards the the back of the house I should say it was
definitely the figure of a man it was about 3 and 1/2 ft tall and it was luminous from head to toe like aluminum
foil would glow with a light cast on it in the dark a glow like that their
bodies were erect they all ran stiff-legged like they were on their heels like their feet were pointed up
everything about their bodies was pretty well proportioned everything was covered it looked like it was all one piece from
head to toe and was all the same color aluminum foil is what it most resembled to me the outfit was silver but it gave
off a white glow they lit up The Path as they went they had nothing in their hands that I could tell but they gave
off a glow so MIM kept her eyes on this one figure as it suddenly stopped Stood
Still for a moment or so quote like it was debating whether to come back into the yard or go into the woods she said
and as it stood there this is when three additional entities appeared all
identical in appearance and they joined the first humanoid then all four ran in
single file back into the woods now poor M was so frightened that she just rushed
back to her bed and laid down as she says it terrified me I've never been so
frightened I don't get scared easily but I was lying there and I knew what I had seen I wanted to see more I wanted to
see if they took off or if they turned in the woods or what but I was too afraid to look because I thought if it
had seen me staring at it then I didn't know if it might get Brave and decide to come back and try to get into the house
or what no M also reported another interesting detail which researchers
call quote the odds factor which is an unusual and Eerie silence in the area of
an encounter as M says in her own words everything was so quiet out there you
didn't hear a bush you didn't hear anything it was just unusual there was no wind and it was really quiet
everything was still was just very very still it just stuck in my mind that it
was dead quiet it was so quiet even with the window closed with the four of them
going down into the woods that they would have rattled enough branches and leaves on the ground to make a noise and
they didn't make any noise to me I remember it being awfully
still so after just a few moments MIM jumped up from bed called her husband at
work and told him to come home at once what he did he immediately called the
police contacted their neighbor and he the neighbor and the police went out
into the woods to investigate both he and his neighbor armed themselves they did a quick search and didn't find
anything but the next morning M wrote down what happened in detail and phoned
the newspapers who put her in touch with a UFO organization she later consented to a
recorded interview with researchers now at no time did she see
any UFO however later Jay Allen heinik spoke directly with them and they told
him that they did in fact find a matted area of vegetation in a nearby Field
where it looked like a large heavy the object may have rested so possible Landing traces though
unconfirmed however incredibly this is not the first time Alton this little
Community has been visited by a humanoid because it was just four years earlier
that a gentleman by the name of Tony Wilkins who lived at 109 West 9th Street
called the police was 9:00 p.m. on June 16 1971 he called the police to say that a
50ft wide silver saucer with green lights had hovered at Treetop level
right behind the back porch of his home he says the figures in inside of this
craft spoke to him telepathically he said they provided him with information that would give him
quote the universe at his fingertips and he says they actually offered to take him for a ride in their
ship so this is what he told the police he said the ET he declined the
invitation from the ETS but the ETS told him that they would return to this location on August 3rd
now apparently this did not happen or if it did we don't know about it and sadly
it wasn't long after this that this witness was reportedly committed to a local state mental
institution I wonder about that I've got questions because in confirmation of
Tony Wilkins claims there was another sighting in this area less than two two weeks earlier when two gentlemen Dean
spree and Tom malar stepped out of the plant where they worked in Alton this
was at 2:00 in the morning on June 4th 1973 and they both reportedly saw a
bright object hover in the sky for more than 5 minutes before it went out quote
like a light bulb and I went to the National UFO Reporting Center website and I have to
tell you I found a dozen other cases over Alton
Illinois so it appears that something weird is going on in this little
Community another interesting case which shows some of those really interesting commonalities we see like the Oz Factor
this Eerie silence that envelops the area it's so interesting also very
common are the way the ETS the humanoids are described with their skin type
little jumpsuits silver in color the way they walk even is commonly described
some really interesting details but again the consistency I think shows that
there is something important going on here so many people report these kinds of things now we move to the next case
which is quite brief I call this one Highway humanoid this is a super
interesting case which doesn't have a whole lot of detail to it granted it is
a single witness case it rests pretty much on one person's anecdotal testimony
though there are apparently some possible what we would call Landing traces this occurred in January more
specifically January 26 1976 between the town of booze lebone
France and madil mandot it's pretty interesting case and I think you'll find
that it's got some interesting takeaways from it this case was published in the
publication the bulletin EIC d c NE guu
which an English stands for the Northeast Committee of euphology groups there's only one witness in this case by
the name of Claude kraton who at 9:45 p.m. on January 26 1976
was driving from madil Mandel lot to Bose Le bone in France these are very
small towns and he was coming around a corner in this little Rural Road when he saw a quote Clash of light he said it
was a brilliant white beam and he thought at first that it might be coming from an approaching motorcycle but it
wasn't cuz after the flash nothing was there so he just continued down the road
he went around a few more corners and this is when CL cl's headlights illuminated a humanoid figure only about
35 ft away and it was standing immobile alongside the highway its unusual
appearance immediately caught claude's attention because it was wearing what looked like a diver's suit with a
welder's helmet there was a face plate there was also a brilliant white light where the forehead was though this light
wasn't sending out any beams of light but the clothing was very unusual it was
glowing was almost fluorescent and it was bright red now clog could only see
the head and torso as the lower half of the figure was hidden by the brush but he was impressed Enough by the unusual
appearance of this figure that as soon as he got to town he called the police and the next day he went with them to
the site and they did find something interesting there there were several broken branches about 10 to 15 ft High
precisely where this figure had stood so researchers were informed about the case
they interviewed the witness and while the witness did report an unusual flash of light no UFO is seen and although the
figure was unusual looking it was quite similar in appearance to what a welder
might wear minus the light on the forehead and again there's also the question of what a welder would be doing
alongside a remote rural Highway at night but ultimately the case remains
unsolved quite a few cases like this where people see apparent ETS while
driving along a remote Highway at night it's interesting because a lot of these cases do start with people seeing
unusual lights this witness did not see a UFO specifically but his encounter
began with an unusual flash of light hitting him in the face and then he sees this strange humanoid by the side of the
road now what is interesting about this case is the way he described it there
are some similarities to a person wearing a welding suit but you have have to ask yourself what would a person be
doing wearing a welding suit standing in a remote location along a highway late
at night that makes no sense whatsoever so yeah a single witness case a very
brief encounter but nevertheless interesting because it shows that this
is you know a type of encounter that happens quite a lot and now we move to the next case
this one got a lot of attention the witness is quite credible he had some really good evidence to support his
story in terms of physiological effects and I call this one the men from the
Star this occurred on January 28th 1976 in vazan Spain and yeah this is a
remarkable encounter which could very well be a missing time on board
encounter though that's not entirely clear but it's certainly a fascinating
case of a very close-up encounter with a landed UFO and humanoids this case was
featured in the muon journal the Spanish magazine stend deck and the Flying
Saucer review as well as in a number of newspaper articles it received quite a
bit of publicity and attention probably because it's a pretty dramatic case with a very credible witness and some really
good evidence there is only one witness a 26-year-old brick layer by the name of
Miguel Fernandez carasco it was a cold night 15 minutes
after midnight on January 28th 1976 as Miguel walked home from San
lucer LA mayor where his girlfriend lived to his home in benazon again in
Spain and he was just 4 km or about 2 and a half miles from his home when he
first noticed the star-like object moving along the horizon so he's just walking singing to himself
he walked another kilometer about a half mile when he turned around because he saw this light shining down on him and
it was this star-like object it had descended to a much lower level and was now passing over his head as Miguel says
it was not very high and it began to approach I took fright and started to run the light came close and then moved
away again and this happened several times so here he is kind of trying to
outrun this light when suddenly he hears a loud roar and this light came right
down to the ground it dimmed and there sitting on the ground in front of him was a strange ship not that far away
said it was oddly shaped somewhat rectangular though it had a rounded top
kind of reminded him of a giant phone booth he said it sat on three Landing legs there was a red and white light
rotating on the top of it reminding him of a siren but it was not huge about 7
feet wide maybe 10 to 12 feet tall and almost immediately a door opened and out
stepped two 7ft tall beings pretty much human looking he said they had long
white hair they wore skintight silver jumpsuits dark shiny boots and they had
belts on that glowed this red light where the Buckle would be and I'll just let Miguel describe this in his own
words as he says it came and it landed on the ground about 2 m from me I
stopped and two men came out of this thing their clothes looked like a frogman with a wide belt with a buckle
and in the center a little light that appeared to me like a sort of pilot light the two men began to speak and I
did not understand them I think they look like men I can't guarantee it absolutely but at any rate that is how
it seemed to me that they looked they were tall very tall so this craft landed right near the
location of the benacazon station and when the door opened this ramp appeared the men walked down it
Miguel was Frozen with fear as these two occupants moved towards him and spoke quote a strange language that was not
Spanish at some point they pointed at him and this frightened Miguel even more
he put his hands over his face and as they approached he couldn't take it anymore he became afraid he bolted away
running in a panic towards the direction of his home now he says he did see these two
figures go back into their craft which immediately Rose upwards moved to a horizontal position and then began to
chase Miguel down the road and Miguel was just entering into the town of Ben
Kazan when this beam of Light Came Down shining from the object directly onto
him he felt heat he felt his whole body kind of burning he frantically ran or tried
to run but at some point he fainted and when he woke up he was not
in the same location he was now at his home located at General Franco 81 at the
front door screaming he told he was screaming to his family the star the
star is coming for me now Miguel does not remember how he got to the front
door he may have run he says and just not remember cuz he was quite
frightened as he says I heard the noise of powerful Motors and looking back I
saw that the UFO was above me giving off something which burned me and I immediately lost
Consciousness when I came to I was lying in the door of my house which was wide open where my sister and brother found
me my hands and face were covered with smudges and according to what I've been told I was shouting close the door
before the star comes in he begged them to close the door before quote the men
from the Star come in now it was 2:30 a.m. when he was found so it appears
that he may very well have had some missing time but there were some interesting physiological effects his
mustache and beard were slightly singed but it was these weird almost soot-like black marks on his body which really
caught people's attention they were located on the right side of his face the palms of his hand on his right hand
and right shoulder so he was rushed to the San Lazaro Hospital in Seville where
he was treated for shock he was not injured in any way the marks which the
doctor said were quote definitely not Burns disappeared mysteriously after
only s or 8 hours such an interesting case this was quite frightening for the
witness and a lot of the press accounts kind of labeled it as a hostile encounter though honestly there's no
evidence of that other than the witness himself was quite frightened it's a very interesting case with these
physiological effects these marks on this man's body which disappeared so
quickly and the doctor confirmed that these were not Burns so I don't know
it's it's unusual to say the least but a very closeup encounter with physical
evidence the family of the witness absolutely confirms that he showed up at
the the doorway quite frantic following his encounter so a really interesting
case to say the least and now we move to the next case which I call another flying humanoid and
these crop up over and over again it's why I wanted to include this case this one is quite brief but it involves a
really I would say respected witness uh he did allow his name to be used it's a
briefcase but boy did he get a closeup look at this object and even closer look
at this flying humanoid this one occurred on April 7 1977 in Milford Haven in Wales it's an
amazing case it was just one month after the very famous broad Haven Primary
School UFO landing that cyal John a former political leader 64 years old at
the time of his sighting had this incredible encounter he woke up at 500
a.m. again on April 7 1977 in his home in Milford Haven Wales
and was getting ready to travel to London England and this is when he
noticed a bright light shining into his bedroom window looking outside he saw
two unbelievable things the first was the silver gray egg-shaped object which
was rocking gently in the air less than 200 ft away it wasn't huge he couldn't
tell exactly how big it was but it looked small maybe 4 feet across he estimates it did have a bright orange
red light on top of it but his attention was drawn to something else much more
shocking which was the seven or8 foot tall humanoid figure which was floating
in the air only 35 ft away from his window this figure was in a face down
horizontal position much like quote a free fall parachutist its arms were out its legs
were bent slightly back he couldn't see its face but its entire body he said was
covered with this silver gray kind of quote boiler suit so cyel watched both the object and
this floating humanoid forget this more than 25 minutes when slowly they both
moved off and disappeared into the distance it is a briefcase but certainly
difficult to explain away given how close it was and how long both the humanoid and the object remained in View
and again it's just one of many cases on record very similar to it this case was
investigated by Rand Jones Pew and was published in a number of UFO
Publications can you imagine waking up seeing your room filling with light looking out and seeing a UFO a couple
hundred feet away and much closer like 30 40 feet away is this floating humanoid who remains there for like a
half hour I mean that's crazy when you think about it and yet there are so many
cases like this so I don't know what that humanoid was doing out there
perhaps this is another of what we would call a display a purposeful encountered
sort of announce the et's presence to another witness being that he's a politician it
might have been something along those lines where they're just trying to let
them let themselves be known to a larger audience hard to say it's pure
speculation but given that there's so many cases like this you have to wonder and now let's move to the next case
which I find really interesting because it is quite unusual this gentleman not not only had a close encounter with a
UFO and humanoids a landed UFO but he walked right up to them and touched them
and had some communication with them very limited granted but a very interesting case
nevertheless it occurred on September 27 1978 in a rural area of Canin
Poland and I like this case for other reasons as well because it turns out
there's some interesting confirmation of this encounter this next case comes from the Norwegian language magazine tid aam
which translates to keep quiet I like the name of that it's really appropriate
given that most people do keep quiet about this subject this is a single witness case the main witness is HRI
mariac a 31-year-old professional chauffeur driver from Galina Poland
this encounter occurred in a forested area near canine Enrique had been given some time
off from his job and since the weather was good on the afternoon of September 27 1978 he decided to take his
motorcycle for a drive into this rural area of canine there was a young Oak
Forest there where he knew lots of edible mushrooms grew and he wanted to go collect them so no sooner had he
arrived parked his motor motorcycle and started picking mushrooms and putting them in a basket when he noticed a
strange object landed nearby in a clearing in the forest he describes this
as an ooid cylinder and it sat on four Landing legs on the ground was totally
silent and I'll just let Enrique describe what happened as he says I
stood looking at it and wondered what it could be when suddenly a hatch opened and two beings who were completely unlik
like us humans appeared in the doorway one of them first spotted me and
signaled me to come closer I walked over to them and stopped next to the strange
vessel kind of staircase appeared under the opening and the creatures slowly
came out I held out my hand and greeted them I noticed that they had dark but
not completely black suits their hands had the same width from the arms and
along the Palms their hands were smaller than mine find shaped and surprisingly
agile they had the same intense green color as their faces when I came up to
them I took them by the hand and greeted them I didn't notice at the time that they had webs around their fingers but
became aware of this later they had glassy red slanted bulging
eyes now these beings were between four and 5 feet tall they began to speak to
each other in this unintelligible language which sounded to enri kind of like a record on highp speed one of them
was holding a device which enri did not know what it was he speculates that it
was a camera of some kind but he really has no idea but he had the impression that one of these beings was holding
this device and making recordings pictures then I'll just let Enrique
describe what happened next as he says they studied my motorbike very thoroughly and were very interested in
my freshly picked mushrooms from their behavior I concluded that they were interested in how I used the motorcycle
they gestured that they would like to see how the motorcycle functioned so I started it up and drove a few meters for
them so he drove about 60 70 ft then stopped and looked back at the
figures they were still there they were not following him but he did see that the figure who was holding this camera
like instrument was now kicking at the ground and it was around this time he heard this strange almost ringing noise
coming from the craft and as soon as that happened he watched as both the little men went back up into this craft
this stero likee device retracted and the craft rose upwards Enrique says he
felt a whoo of air as it moved off and it disappeared quickly out of view in
about 15 seconds he went to examine the landing site and he saw four clear
prints where this craft had stood so he he was quite astonished by
this he drove home and told his skeptical wife who later told reporters that she could think of no reason why
her husband would lie to her now unknown to the witness there was in fact another
encounter earlier that morning not far away in Magi Poland this is just a few
hundred miles to the South a group of children were by their school and they
saw this greenish skinned creature which they described as having large slanted eyes
webbed hands and wearing a tight fitting black suit which they set at a bright round circle on his chest it was
standing at the edge of this forested area and as soon as they saw it it raised its hand they were able to get a
good look at this one of the witnesses Kristoff wenak said and I quote the
creature had a green color and oblique eyes the fingers of his hands were United with a membrane like the feet of
a duck he walked without haste into the woods in the direction of Magnus at that moment we felt much fear
because we had never seen an individual before we began to run away from there
in the direction of the school now it turned out that the previous night a teacher and her
daughter saw a glowing red object hovering above the forest in the same exact area and there was another witness
a farmer Joseph paac who also reported Ed seeing apparently this same glowing
red object I will say that this encounter has generated some controversy
there is at least one researcher who believes that this was a hoax I don't or I would not have included it because the
fact is the witness's wife absolutely believes him and there's all this
corroborating evidence not only the landing traces but the fact that there was another encounter not far away that
same morning involving a very similarly described humanoids and other Encounters
in that area around that time it's a lot of activity going on at once so yeah I
think it's a legitimate case I like it because it's an unusual interaction between the ETS and the witness and I'm
glad he stepped forward CU I've said it before most don't so kudos to any witness who has the courage to step
forward and allow their name to be used cuz often they will be ridiculed and
disbelieved and did happen to this unfortunate witness though many people did believe him especially after there
were other Witnesses found in the area who were also experiencing really
unusual activity including humanoids all right now moving on to
another case this one also is quite brief I call this one right over the car
this occurred on November 13 1982 in Port Wakefield in South
Australia this is a super interesting case what I like about it is because the
Witnesses in this case got a very closeup look and actually just looked right inside this craft got a very good
inside view of it that's pretty unusual didn't actually land but yeah it was
close enough where they were able to get a lot of detail of what these humanoids look like and what the inside of the
craft itself looked like there's not a whole lot of information about this next case it's quite brief but definitely
interesting it occurred at 5:30 in the morning of November 13 1982 as two men
were driving towards Port Wakefield in South Australia without warning a big
red light appeared on the right side of their vehicle quickly disappeared but moments later it reappeared this time
right in front of their car so they were shocked they slowed the car down to just a few miles per power at which point the
object moved straight towards them veered to the left and began to Pace their car at this point the passenger
rolled down his window and stuck his head out to get a better look at the object and he did he could see that this
object was only about 10 ft above the ground he said it was as big as a truck
there was a white and a red light at the back end of the object the front however was quote opened he said opened in a way
that he could see right into the cabin cabin of this strange craft the front end was transparent the interior glowed
with a yellow light he also saw a yellow beam of light coming down from the object and going towards the ground but
strangely not actually touching it and this craft was close enough that this
witness could see all these interesting details inside the cabin itself which he
said was covered with various instruments and gauges even more amazing he said that
there were several quote things or figures which were standing in front of these
instruments then to his fear one of the figures bent forward and looked out the
window right down at their car and this caused the witnesses to go into a panic
as one of them told the other let's get away from here so they drove off at high speed and to the relief the object did
not follow them and that was the end of it however there is an interesting end
note because 3 months later in late February of 1983 Jim lmore and his wife Judy and
their family were driving along three chain Road not far away from this area
when they saw a bright orange blue object in the sky meanwhile local police
and radio stations were receiving reports now this might be a conventional
thing because it turns out that the Army proof range at Port Wakefield was test
fir caring grenade launchers 600 ft up into the sky they of course couldn't say
whether or not this was the cause of the reports but in any rate it could be a
possible confirmation of other weird activity in that area at that time such
a shame that so many witnesses have this strong fear reaction I have to wonder if they had not D driven away in a panic if
there might have been more interaction with this particular
uh UFO and ETS but an absolutely fast end case and once again corroborated to
some extent by other people who've seen UFOs in that area at that
time and now we mve to another really interesting case not long ago I covered
a case in honos Norway and here's another one I call this one 100 little
aliens this is a really unusual case to say the least it occurred on October
28th 1985 again in honos Norway there's a lot to like about this case a lot of
witnesses uh some interesting Landing trace evidence as well uh and it was professionally
investigated uh what is interesting about this case is the fact that there were so many reported humanoids as we
shall see this astonishing case was featured in the Norwegian language
publication titled appropriately UFO was 545 in the evening October 28
1985 as seven children in the hangel area of honos Norway noticed a strange
light in the sky some of these Witnesses include Havard age n Rasmus age 10 run
age 8 you can see them here and other children including May age 11 helain age
10 Freddy age s Lars age 10 and Paul age
nine and more so quite a few witnesses as it turned out that evening happened
to be a lunar eclipse and the children were all outside playing along hangley
Road the eclipse had already begun when this mysterious light appeared in the sky and immediately started to come
closer and grow larger so they all started watching this and this light
suddenly stopped and began to descend towards the ground and they children
could now see that this was not just a light it was in fact a gray saucer like
two plates put together they said it had a bright light in the bottom center and
smaller dimmer lights around the perimeter the circumference it began to descend first
slowly and then pretty quickly now one of the children Havard did have a flash
flashlight and he was an estimated 600 to 700 ft away from this object and he
flashed his flashlight directly at it and as if an answer the saucer directed
a beam of light back at them they said it was much brighter than a car headlight this subject then Rose
vertically and suddenly disappeared they said it was about as big as a large room or a garage is how
they put it some of the children who had been illuminated by this light later suffer from nausea for a short time
afterwards now here's where it gets interesting CU as soon as this craft was no longer visible an enormous group of
little humanoids appeared some of the children said that there was as many as 100 of these little humanoids and they
started popping up everywhere around them now per the children these figures
were very small less than 2 ft tall and they immediately began to run around
kind of playing hide-and seek almost seeming to hide from the children uh being a little
bit prankster is they ran in this strange way very stiffly in a leaning
forward posture now the children could also hear these beings talking or rather
mumbling in a sort of incomprehensible language one of the kids immediately
went to fetch a flash camera and he took a picture but as the flash went off all
of the little humanoids scattered shortly later they came back
for the witnesses they had a little bit of different appearance each of them some wore suits that looked black in
color others looked whitish some were white and brown all of them were wearing
what looked like squarish helmets they seemed to have eyes which glowed white
but the kids got good enough view of them some of them were quite close that they could easily distinguish the arms
and hands of these beings and they were running all over the place on the road
on the playground everywhere all around them one of the children rushed to turn
on a light that illuminated part of this area at which point all of the beings again scattered towards the darker
sections soon became clear to the kids that these little humanoids did not like
light some of the children did become frightened they fled back to their homes some ran to get their parents or other
adults but in each case they were not believed researchers later spoke to the adults
who confirmed this fact that yeah their children had run up tried to inform them
and they did not pay attention the other children of course stayed in the area and continued to
observe now at one point the children said that there was an adult a jogger who came through the area and one of
these little figures in a very prankster way ran right between his legs
apparently freaked this jogger out um who said said that he thought it was a
cat now the kids did not cuz this had been going on for quite some time I mean
this hideand-seek Behavior went on for a few hours until about
9:15 but at some point during all this two or three glowing objects were seen
in the sky they did not land and that was the end of it or so it would seem
because later strange Footprints were found in this area they were the shape
of a half moon they measured about three to four inches long and as the witnesses
and investigators were looking at these one of the family dogs came up and started sniffing them and he completely
freaked out he reacted wildly sniffing at them and then running away in fear in such a way that he tried to dig a hole
under the fence as if to escape so some of the boys later looked
over the entire area and did find a spot of flattened grass about 10 feet wide
they couldn't confirm whether or not that this was attributable to the object which had disappeared upon coming in for
a landing but this case was pretty thoroughly investigated several investigators looked into this case one
was Leaf Havoc but others as well in fact they contacted the police the local
radar station at maoy and the military none of them had any information on this
case but they did discover the researchers did that there were apparently more sightings in the
following three days including both sightings of strange lights and a couple
reports of the humanoids as well so needless to say this event was discussed
by the children for several weeks afterward and it became more and more clear to the parents that their children
had experienced some kind of traumatic traumatic event some children were
afraid some however said that they quote weren't afraid a second 100 little
aliens that's a lot you know wouldn't surprise me if there was less than that 50 but let's face it 50 is still an
enormous number of humanoids it's an incredibly unusual case but by all
appearances completely legitimate given that there were quite a few Witnesses some physical evidence and while the
most of the Witnesses were young children even their parents who were skeptical at first came to realize that
no these children had a real encounter some of them were quite frightened by what happened and again yeah they talked
about it for a long time afterwards and again it's not the only really
interesting encounter in that area honas Norway what an amazing case and now we
move to the next one which is one of my favorite in this collection I find this
case I don't know exactly why it's super fascinating I call this one the aliens
in the bushes it occurred one afternoon in October of
1986 in VI Entre Rios Argentina and what I like about this
case is it has some interesting physical evidence it was a very close-up encounter with humanoids it's got some
interesting electromagnetic effects as well and it's also really interesting
because there was quite a bit of corroboration in terms of other Encounters in that
area at that time including humanoid encounters so yeah I think you'll find
this one quite interesting this next case comes from Argentinian researchers
Ariel Leos and Oscar Raul Mendoza the witness is 30-year-old
Alberto Meyer a farmer and Hunter whose property is located about 8 km Southwest
of the town of vial between the T ofal and SE it was
one day in October 1986 that Alberto went out into one of his fields to cut logs and this is when
something strange happened the motor of his chainsaw suddenly stopped for no apparent reason and at this exact moment
he heard and felt a strong vibrating sound coming from above was strong
enough to make his whole body and even the ground beneath him shake for just a few seconds
so puzzled he immediately looked up and around but he couldn't see anything and
the vibration lasted only a few seconds when he tried to start his chainsaw again it worked fine now he wondered if
perhaps a plane or a helicopter had just flown by too quickly for him to see but now that it was gone and everything was
fine he didn't think too much about this curious incident not until 2 days later
when he had an extraordinary encounter so two days days later he went
back to the same area to load the cut wood into his car which he planned to
transport to a local bakery in VI he had filled up his car halfway when
he perceived a quote strange sensation he stopped what he was doing
and looked around he didn't see anything at first but this strange sensation
persisted and that's when he noticed some bushes moving a short distance away
now he thought it was going to be an animal coming out of the brush but instead two short and very strange
looking people appeared when he saw them he thought at first that they might be
Hunters but they had come from where there is a sizable stream with no easy way to cross so he was wondering who
they were he raised his arm in a friendly greeting shouted out to them and these beings responded only by
stopping about 100 ft away from him and looking at him Direct directly quietly
he wondered if they hadn't heard him because the wind was blowing away from them in his Direction so he approached
closer and as he did he saw that they were dressed in very unusual clothing
and he wondered for a second if they were escaped prisoners or criminals of some kind he got closer to them and
approached to almost 25 ft and this is when he realized that he was in fact
experiencing something truly unusual they did not look human this frightened
him he attempted to walk away but found that he couldn't his legs became paralyzed he felt as if his willpower
had left him though he was able to remain standing and alert and he says this strange calmness came over him so
he could now see that these two beings were wearing a sort of muted Rosy colored very skin tight jumpsuit he says
it looked like shiny plastic it covered their entire bodies was so tight that he
could see their musculature easily their heads he said were twice the size of a
normal person completely bald no hair they had large pointed ears their eyes
were not overly large they had visible no visible eyebrows very small noses
white at the bottom and very thin almost indistinguishable mouths with no real
lips their faces took up only a small portion of their very large heads and
one of them appeared to be holding a thin type of rod in its hand so there were two figures and one of them was a
few steps behind into the side of the first and Alberto could see from the
shape of her body that this figure was in fact female both Figures were about 5T tall
their arms were hanging down by their sides the main investigator OS Oscar
Raul Mendoza actually drew the beings in detail while in the presence of Alberto
who verified the accuracy of this drawing now after just a few moments of
staring at Alberto the female humanoid smiled slightly as if to say that
everything was going to be okay and that they were friends and then they both moved off in this weird gliding
fashion Alberto described it as if they were on skates or floating just above
the ground they easily navigated the uneven terrain and disappeared off into
the Wilderness the moment they were out of sight Alberto's paralysis disappeared
and overcome with fear at what just happened he fled the scene now a short time later he returned
to the scene with researchers and to their amazement they found a very clear
small footprint in the soil exactly where Al Alberto had seen these beings
and you can see it here amazing even more interesting is that this area seems to be of some interest
to the ETS because it was just one year later around 5:00 p.m. one evening in
August of 1987 that several young children were walking along the stream looking for a
place to fish When They Came Upon a very short figure they said it was 1 and 1/2
maybe 2 feet in height and they described it pretty similar to the way Berto described the beings he saw beings
that these kids saw had this overly large oval-shaped heads completely bald
large round staring eyes and both were wearing tight fitting onepiece red body
suits now the children first saw only one figure was bending down to apparently examine or pick something up
off the ground and realizing that this was not a human a very ual looking
creature one of the boys screamed in shock and the being reacted he
apparently heard this because he immediately sprinted away towards the woods and it was at this moment that
another being that had been hidden in the bushes appeared and joined the first one and they both disappeared off into
the brush the frightened children immediately left the scene and here it gets even more
interesting because just a few hours later a busload of passengers in the area observed a bright disc-shaped
object hovering above the road and it doesn't end here further
indication of the et's interest in this area occurred just a few months before
Alberto's encounter one afternoon in the spring of 1986 a bus load of passengers was
driving near tabasi this is a village located immediately north of VI and as
the bus approached a hill where there were some high tension wires the driver
and all the people in the bus saw this short figure standing alongside the road staring upwards at the electric
lines the bus driver initially thought that this might be a passenger waiting for a ride so he slowed down but then he
saw this figure and he kept driving because as they approached this figure
he and the other passengers saw that this was not a normal person he was very
short in stature he was wearing a shiny silver outfit that covered its entire
body had very large staring eyes and once again a large bald head this filled
the bus driver with fear and it quickly accelerated from the area what an interesting case that is
given that one of the ETS actually smiled at the witness he got this sense
that it was just saying you know no need to be afraid were friends that does turn up in a lot of cases and how about that
last incident with the bus drivers can you imagine if that bus had actually stopped because they thought this guy
was a passenger wanting to get on the bus of course he turned out to be another one of these short little
humanoids in a silver suit so interesting I would love to talk to that
whole busload of passengers and just interview each of them and see what they
thought of this encounter Now we move on to the next case uh this one is really interesting
it's the last one of this bunch I call it humanoids above a city street there's
quite a few cases where people have Encounters in areas which you would least expect very urban areas and these
should be widely viewed but often aren't so there's something really mysterious
going on here that I think we're still trying to figure out it's why I want to
include this case it's a fairly recent case that occurred on January 19
1991 in ronberg Germany and yeah this is a very unusual
case because this witness got a very very closeup look at these humanoids
this UFO right over a very busy street which strangely became suddenly devoid
of pedestrian traffic and other cars this is an aspect that turns up in a
number of cases and it raises a lot of questions the witness in this case
requested anonymity and is known only by her first name and last initial Helga F
she was 38 years old at the time of her encounter was just after 9:00 p.m.
January 1991 and she was walking along the highway that runs right through the
middle of ronberg when she heard a quote loud humming noise combined with bangs
and looking up she saw what looked like a V for formation of bright yellow lights didn't think too much of it
assumed it was a squadron of Plaines but things became stranger she immediately started to hear this shrill
beeping noise and this weird odd feeling overcame her which she couldn't really
describe she continued walking when without warning an incredibly strong
wind thrust down towards her actually knocked her into a tree she said she had
to cling to a lampost to keep from falling down and this this enormous wind
raged around her for about 20 full seconds and this is went really strange
went to completely bizarre cuz looking around her she noticed that the normally busy street was completely devoid of
cars and people also the power appeared to have gone out there were no lights on
some of these buildings which previously had lights on them she could also hear a strange thrumming noise in her
ears and suddenly right in front of her about 50 to 75 ft away right over the
middle of this street was a saucer shaped craft Helga estimates it was big about
200 feet wide it went right over both sides of the street even overlapping the
homes on either side and she said could not have been more than 100 ft up as hel
says at first I thought I was going crazy when I saw the UFO for the first
time then I looked a second time and it was still visible in my mind I said to
myself when you look up three times you'll wave my arm went up heavily as if there
was lead in it and I waved suddenly the UFO tilted now she's not quite sure why she
reacted that way but now that this craft had tilted she could see that it had a transparent Dome there was a circular
base she said yellow pulsating lights dotted the inner ring of the base of
this craft in the middle of it was a bright yellow light but the Outer Perimeter had yellow green and red
lights and the craft itself she said was metallic and as Helga says and I'll
quote her extensively I was so frightened I saw three men in the UFO the three men were
wearing silver tight fitting suits their faces were not recognizable they had
something like a helmet on in the UFO itself many small dots could be seen
like a dashboard in the middle something like a television could be seen one of
them ran forward with a black round stick and pointed it at me when the one
on the right wanted to come over the other pointed the stick from left to right and in a few seconds the UFO
turned to the right now now one of the UFO occupants
was standing right in front of the monitor screen with its back to Helga and she was close enough to this object
looking inside of it that she could see what looked like three Laurel leaves
just above this monitor sort of a symbol or something she saw that the other
occupant had a belt with the same symbol on it all the occupants were wearing
high sold boots and gloves their face was covered with a visor of some kind
which had an opening for a mouth two dots for the nose the figure in the front of the
monitor she said was incredibly tall now she estimates 13 ft the other two were
still tall but a foot or two shorter than the first one they moved in this weird manner very slowly very stiffly
almost robotic like movements though she does not feel they were robots one of
the shorter ones was holding this weird black stick which she described said it looked almost like a flashlight she
feared it might be a weapon and seeing it as they kind of pointed it towards her she hid behind this thick lamp post
and peered out from behind it and this is when she saw the two UFO occupants look at each other and she received the
strange mental impression that one was telling the other no I can't see it now
when this man moved this stick from left to right this is when the craft did disappeared in a split
second Helga felt like this whole encounter lasted only about 3
minutes her walk should have taken 5 minutes cuz she left at 900 p.m. and was
going to this restaurant the Adler restaurant to meet her boyfriend but when she arrived there it was already
9:30 and her boyfriend asked why are you so late so she told him and their
friends who were also there I saw a UFO and they didn't really believe her they
laughed at her which hurt her feelings and she kept quiet about her encounter
until reading about UFOs just a few weeks later and decided to contact
investigators so investigators were quite puzzled by her account
particularly because it took place on such a busy City street they did put out an ad looking for other Witnesses and
were contacted by a woman who who said that she and her husband had seen a low-flying bright object over ronberg on
the night immediately prior to Helga's sighting now investigators were also
able to get confirmation of a power failure on that day that the witness had her sighting but what they had trouble
understanding was how nobody else saw the UFO on such a busy street this entire case was written up
in the German UFO magazine j u f f the journal for UFO forong which means in
English the journal for UFO research what an amazing case that was very
unusually described humanoids I do wonder if she had missing time there's
no clear indication of that other than the fact that she was 20 minutes late
but to me the most fascinating aspect of this case is the fact that this normally crowded City street suddenly had no
people on it no cars this turns up again and again and again so it's as if people
are being pulled out of normal reality in some way perhaps and I don't know how
to describe this I've got a lot of questions about it but it certainly turns up quite a bit and that alone
makes this case quite important it's a fascinating case because it was well researched they did find another witness
they did confirm this power failure so it's pretty clear something profound
happened to this witness all right that's it for today 10
cases from all over the world across Europe South America the United States
Australia again this points to these cases occurring pretty much everywhere
on this planet in the fact these cases alone go from the 1940s goes to the
1991's confirms again what we already know that this has been an ongoing
phenomenon we are being visited they are here uh that's why I gave it this title
because I think we now have enough cases to say conclusively that we are being visited
by extraterrestrials so hope you enjoyed this episode I hope perhaps you learned
something I really want to thank you again for watching I truly appreciate it
it's because of you guys I do this show so thank you thank you thank you and
till next week keep having fun keep asking those hard questions keep
searching for the truth and I will see you next week bye for now
