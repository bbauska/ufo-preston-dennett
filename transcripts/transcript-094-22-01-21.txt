TOP TWENTY UFO ENCOUNTERS IN ARIZONA: PART II
Jan 21, 2022

Summary:
Jan 21, 2022
The state of Arizona has played a powerful role in shaping our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. In fact, many of the world's most influential UFO cases have taken place here. Sightings, UFO waves, hot-spots, radar cases, UFO landings, photographic cases, face-to-face encounters, onboard UFO experiences, government cover-ups, UFO crash/retrievals -- Arizona has them all.

Part One of this two-part episode presented a countdown of the top twenty cases from number twenty down to number eleven. Now, in Part Two, we countdown Arizona's top ten best cases. These are the cases that have defined the UFO phenomenon. Some of them have garnered national headlines, and others are not well-known but deserve to be placed in the annals of UFO history. The time for skepticism is over. We must now face the fact that UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are visiting our planet, and these are the cases that prove it. 

These cases, and hundreds of others, are all featured in my book,

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal. 
This is actually part two of a two-part episode I call the top 20 ufo cases in arizona. In part 
one I presented case number 20 all the way to 11 and here in part two I'm going to present the top 
10 cases. And as I said in part one, these are the most influential cases that have received 
a lot of publicity. Cases that have unique and interesting elements. Basically, the best cases. The 
cases that have had a really profound influence on how we perceive and understand the ufo phenomenon. 
I'm going to do a countdown from case number 10 all the way to number one. And, again, another researcher would probably have come up with a different list it was very hard 
to choose between so many encounters. But these are the ones I came up with and I think you'll 
find them quite interesting. I certainly hope so. So, let's get started. 

For case number 10 I chose the ufo abduction of Brian Allen Scott. This is not a very well known case  although there is a full length book on this case. It's quite unusual with some very interesting elements.  Some good evidence and I think I find it very interesting. Brian Allen Scott was born on October 
12, 1943 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As he grew up, he started to have a number of unusual experiences.
 
At age 16 for example, he was walking outside his home when a small orange ball of light 
dropped from the sky and hovered right next to him. It then darted right back up. This happened 
several times. His major alien experiences didn't really begin until he moved to Arizona. 

He was 28 years old, March 14, 1971, and he had gone out with his friend, Nick Corbin to the 
Apache Junction area. In the wilderness of the Superstition Mountains. To go target shooting. 
And suddenly, a UFO showed up. A glowing oval-shaped object hovered overhead. The next thing Brian 
knows he is being pulled up into this craft. A doorway opened, he's pulled inside, and sat down inside a corridor. He said the inside of this object was warm, musty, and brightly lit with a strange foggy light. 
Next thing he knows his friend Nick is being pulled through the same doorway and deposited right beside him. 
Both men felt numb and unable to speak. When two seven and a half foot tall gray-skinned figures 
came through another doorway and began to undress them. Nick became frightened, 
tried to resist and he passed out. He was taken out of Brian's view. Brian says he felt little fear 
but he was unable to resist. As this figure led him to another room where there was yet another 
figure. And this second figure was manipulating a strange alien instrument which emitted a beam of 
light. Striking Brian's body he felt numb. He says it gave him a headache. At this point an even 
taller being entered the room and placed its hand on Brian's head and proceeded to communicate. 
This being said his name was Voltar and began showing Brian images of its home planet which he 
said had been destroyed by a mutated virus. At this point, Brian and his friend Nick were then put back 
into the corridor where they had first arrived. Then floated gently down to the ground. The UFO 
darted away and they returned to their car. 

It was now past 11 p.m so this experience had taken at least 
two hours. At this point Brian could still remember everything that happened. But as they 
drove away his memory instantly faded. By the time he got home, the only thing  
he could recall was seeing this strange craft. Everything else was shrouded in missing time. 
Two years later, on March 22, 1973 he returned to the site of this ufo event. He saw a small 
humanoid entity. It freaked him out and he fled the scene. Following this he had a series 
of missing time abductions. One on October 25, 1973. Another two years later on November 21st, 
1975 and again, december 22, 1975. And in that last one he was missing for over a day. 27 hours. 
So, he realized what was happening at this point and he sought out a ufo investigator. 

His case generated quite a bit of interest and researchers from APRO, CUFOS, and MUFAN converged 
and began to investigate Brian. Eventually, went under regressive hypnosis, he was able to recall 
what had happened during his first abduction. This is when things got really weird. He began 
to fall into trances during which he would make strange drawings or channel alleged alien entities. 
At the same time, numerous small balls of light were often seen around him. This was verified 
by his ex-wife and several investigators. In fact, there were so many experiences like this that his 
ex-wife had to be hospitalized because of panic and hysteria. This happened on several occasions. 
Brian also began to exhibit the ability of spoon bending, bending metal. This usually happened when 
he lapsed into a trance. There were all kinds of other strange phenomena. 
Mysterious drops of water would materialize over his head. Once he materialized an ancient greek 
gold coin whose authenticity was later confirmed by numismatists researcher Bill 
Hamilton. Who personally interviewed Brian and saw him perform spoon bending. He sat in Brian's channeling 
sessions. Brian's voice was recorded during some of these channeling sessions. And electronic analysis 
showed that it was different from Brian's normal voice. The information given during these sessions 
typically involved very deep subjects such as binary and trinary computer mathematics, 
genetics, and cloning orbital mechanics, astronomy, electromagnetics, quantum physics, and more. 
So, all kinds of weird stuff happened to Brian. He began having precognition. 
Actually, gave some prophecies that turned out to be accurate. It's quite a long story. 
Too complex to really tell in its totality here. There is a full-length book on his case written 
by James Frazier. It's called "Transformation of a Common Man, the Brian Scott Story". It's really an 
incredible story of ufo abduction. With all sorts of really good evidence and strange elements to it. 
And that's why I gave it the number 10 spot on this list.

Now we move to case number nine and for number nine I chose ufo sighting at Davis-Monthan Air Force 
Base. This occurred on May 1st, 1952. It's a very interesting multiple witness sighting that caused 
quite a shakeup at high levels within our air force. That's why I gave it space number nine on this 
list. J Allen Hynek says of this case and I quote, "this case is a classic and in fact it really 
shook up the air force at high levels". This was, again, on May 1st. 1952 and on that day Air Force 
Intelligence officer Major Rudolf Pestilosi was standing at the steps of the base hospital at 
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. When he and another airman saw two round metallic objects approach. 
A b-36 plane which was flying directly over the base, the two objects raced forward at about four 
times the speed of the b-36, then slowed down and took formation around it. One object flew about 
20 feet behind the port side. While the other flew between the right engine and the leading edge of 
the tail. So right next to this b36 and for the next five minutes, these two objects paced the aircraft, 
then suddenly took off. One took off first and then the other disk stopped, hovered, and followed the other 
thoroughly shaking up the crew. The b-36 requested permission to make an immediate landing at 
Davis Mountain. Permission was of course granted and Major Pestilozi as the intelligence officer, 
interrogated the crew of the b-54 and learned that all 10 men aboard had closely observed both objects 
which they said had a convex top and bottom, were about 25 feet in diameter, and about 12 feet thick. 
The plane suffered no malfunctions but Major Pestilozy was impressed by this sighting which he 
himself witnessed. He prepared a file about the incident which he called quote "the thickest report 
I'd ever filed on a ufo". So, the Air Force was notified and J Allen Hynek was called in to investigate 
the case. He labeled it "unidentified". Unfortunately blue book officials did not agree 
and as J Allen Hynek writes and I quote "despite the detailed description of the maneuvers of 
two shiny silver objects blue book dismissed this case as aircraft". 

Years later in 1966 Dr James McDonald heard about this case and decided to investigate. He contacted 
project blue book and he learned that the files were missing and could not be found. So, unable to get any cooperation from blue book officers, Dr McDonald contacted the witnesses himself. He did a big 
investigation and then sent blue book a letter. He sent it to Major Hector Quintanilla the head of project blue book detailing his investigation. And everything he had learned and as Hynek writes and I quote "I recall that at that time Dr McDonald was regarded by blue book personnel as an outstanding nuisance. This was partly because 
he was interested in a scientific study of the true ufos and partly because he was so outspoken 
he spoke his mind forcefully and didn't hesitate to criticize blue book methods 
whenever possible it is due to the industry and perseverance of dr james mcdonald that this 
excellent case was resurrected at all here's a very interesting endnote about this case 
major rudolph pestilosi was apparently a ufo contactee and he later following this case said 
that he was actually in telepathic contact with et's and receiving messages from them and in fact 
he published a book of his channeled messages which he called letters to you from baloran 
so as you can see it's a very interesting case and that's why I gave it number nine on this list so 
that's number nine now we move to number eight and for number eight I chose walt andrus sees a ufo 
this is a very interesting multiple witness daylight sighting involving a trained observer 
and it ended up having a really really profound an impact on the ufo field which is why I gave it 
this number eight slot on this list and I believe you'll find it really interesting on august 15 
1948 walt andrus was a graduate of the u.s navy electronics technician program a pilot and amateur 
radio operator was with his wife and son in downtown phoenix when they all saw four daylight 
discs flying in formation overhead walt andrus first noticed the discs after his five-year-old 
son shouted out daddy look silver balloons he looked up and couldn't believe his eyes as he says 
four round dull silver objects were floating slowly in the northwest at an angle of 45 
degrees above the horizon moving straight west three were flying in geometric formation 
while the fourth was lower and considerably behind the first on our side of the street stopped to 
watch these objects as we followed them across the sky moving directly west the objects arrived 
at a point nearly straight north of us when the lead object disappeared in the clear sky 
shortly after that the rest of the objects followed disappearing in the same spot 
while andrus was also a weather observer he would release weather balloons on a near daily basis 
and he's absolutely positive that these objects were not balloons so they continued 
to watch the sky and to their surprise three of these objects reappeared in the distance 
still flying in formation they were visible for only a few seconds before darting away 
but it was long enough for walt anders to see that these were circular thin disk-like objects 
as he says and I quote you remember it vividly it makes an impression on your mind that you never 
wipe out so he was stunned this led to a lifelong interest in ufos and inspired him to join afro and 
then 20 years later in 1967 he became one of the founding members of mufon the mutual ufo network 
and in fact headed the organization for many years and was editor of the mufon journal so you can see 
how important this case was and what an impact it had on the ufo field we now now move to number 
seven and for case number seven I chose the ufo research of dr james mcdonald dr james mcdonald 
was an atmospheric physicist at the university of arizona and one of the first scientists to really 
dig into ufo research he had a profound impact on the field and that's why I gave him the number 
seven slot on this list the impact of dr james mcdonald cannot be underestimated in my opinion 
he was born on may 7 1920 and first became interested in ufos following a sighting but let 
me first just give a quote from dr james mcdonald which I think is a really interesting quote 
as dr james mcdonald says the type of ufo reports that are most intriguing are close range sightings 
of machine like objects of unconventional nature and unconventional performance characteristics 
seen at low altitudes and sometimes even on the ground the general public is unaware of 
the large number of such reports from credible witnesses when one starts searching for such cases 
their numbers are quite astonishing so as I said dr james mcdonald first became interested in ufos 
following a sighting he was 34 years old it was 1954 and he was driving through the arizona desert 
with two other meteorologists when he spotted an unidentified flying object they all looked 
up none of them men could identify this object it was just a distant point of light in the sky 
but it was absolutely unexplainable to them and this is what brought dr james mcdonald 
into the field of ufology by the late 1950s he began quietly investigating ufo reports 
not only in arizona but across the united states he joined various ufo groups and 
given his training in atmospheric physics he was able to bring his scientific knowledge to studies 
these reports and explain some of them that had been inexplicable dr mcdonald also had a security 
clearance with the uso us government and so he was able to look at a number of ufo reports from 
project blue book and was surprised to find how many of them were absolutely unexplained 
and he ended up investigating hundreds of cases and I'd like to just quote one really interesting 
case of a ufo landing that he was never able to explain this occurred on the evening of october 9 
1967 when a 13 year old boy by the name of richard who was the son of a prominent businessman 
in the area he was riding his bike around the neighborhood when he came upon an eight foot 
tall metallic cylindrical shaped object resting on the ground about 50 feet away this object 
stood on two legs each of which ended on a large circular pad and wondering what this thing was 
richard moved closer and got to about 35 feet distance when suddenly this object made a deep 
low-pitched hum and took off straight upwards disappearing into the night sky 
so richard approached the area where this object had landed and saw deep imprints in the soil 
dr james mcdonald heard about the case and was able to investigate 
he photographed and examined the landing traces and determined that these two landing pads were 42 
inches apart and 13.4 inches wide and were made in hard packed soil so whatever this 
object was it was quite heavy he was very much impressed by this case so he contacted 
air force officials at davis-monthan air force base and told them about this incident 
blue book air force personnel came in and conducted an investigation and later 
air force colonel raymond sleeper wrote a 60-page report on the case finally labeling it a hoax 
this shocked dr mcdonald who absolutely disagreed and believed that the boy had seen a genuine ufo 
jim and coral lorenzen also investigated the case and agreed with dr james mcdonald so 
this just goes to show how project blue book was not a true investigative body 
and dr james mcdonald became very vocal in this field at this point he criticized project 
project blue book and he also criticized dr j allen heineck for not being more assertive and 
vocal about ufo cases he was highly critical of the u.s government's handling of this subject 
and critical of other mainstream scientists refusal to take this subject seriously 
and so many cases would have gone unrecorded if not for james mcdonald he really brought a lot of 
science and credibility to this subject that was sorely lacking he was really the only or 
one of very few mainstream scientists who was openly investigating ufo reports at this time 
and in fact his impact was so influential that researcher ann druffle wrote a book about james 
mcdonald's investigations and his life the book is called firestorm and it shows what a crucial 
and integral role james mcdonald played in the ufo field unfortunately he died on june 13 1971 
but again dr james mcdonald's impact on this field is absolutely 
phenomenal and that's why I gave him spot number seven on this list so that's number seven as you 
can see he did have a really big impact on this field probably even more influential is 
what I chose for number six which is the ufo research of jim and coral lorenzen they were the 
founders of apro the aerial phenomenon research organization which was the first citizen ufo group 
it's quite a story definitely deserves a spot on this list which is why I gave it number six 
jim lorenzen was born in 1922 and cora lorenzen was born three years later in 1925 
and coral lorenzen saw her first ufo at age nine in wisconsin was quite a famous well-publicized 
event and this is what sparked her interest in ufos but it wasn't until years later in fact 
on june 10 1947 when coral lorenzen had another major ufo sighting it was 11 pm she stepped out 
on her porch when she saw a glow forming to the south it increased in brightness and became a 
ball of light which zipped upwards at high speed until disappearing and she had seen balloons and 
missile launches and had never seen anything like this and she says and I quote there was only one 
explanation for the thing I had seen there might be intelligent life on other worlds and their 
ships were the strange things people had reported in the heavens from time to time through the years 
so this sighting really intrigued her and this was the event that inspired her to form the group 
apro the aerial phenomenon research organization and this is the first citizen ufo study group 
the first group of its kind of any influence and they formed it in 1952 and it quickly became 
very popular they had thousands of members that investigators from all across the u.s and the 
world they started issuing a monthly newsletter and just had an enormous impact on this field 
they really were the ones who popularized the subject of ufos they put out a series of 
very well received books and in fact they were the first to recognize the phenomena of missing time 
they were among the first to recognize humanoid reports so they were true pioneers in this field 
and it turns out our own government was very very interested in what was going on with apro 
and just one year after apro had been formed the lorenzens discovered that they were being spied on 
by the us government one summer day in 1953 coral was at her home when two men drove up 
stopped and knocked on the door claiming to be paint contractors and wanting to paint the house 
coral informed these two men that they were actually renters and the painters then tried to engage coral in casual conversation and get her to talk about apro 
which she thought was strange they then returned to their car and drove off and she noticed they 
didn't stop at anyone else's house which she thought was strange if they were truly painters 
why didn't they not stop at other people's homes so she told her husband jim and later they shared 
the story with other people in apro and made a shocking discovery as it turned out the treasurer 
of apra and the secretary of afro both reported that they were visited by apparently the same 
two mysterious gentlemen and in both cases these gentlemen seemed more interested in talking about 
apro than about obtaining a contract to do painting so that was weird and 
after that they found out that one of their ufo field investigators was actually a cia agent so 
this really shook them up and they started looking into this and jim lorenzen actually discovered 
that the government was in fact very interested in their research as jim lorenzen writes an associate 
of miss lorenzen whose husband worked in the osi the office of special investigations told her 
that the local office had a sizable dossier on apro and the lorenzens the government 
while claiming that ufos weren't real was actually very interested in what apra was doing 
apro remained very active in this field for more than 35 years though around 1969 the membership 
of april began to decline because there was a new group the mutual ufo network but they absolutely 
changed the face of ufo research they provided the model really for all other ufo groups and 
april remained active until their death jim lorenzen died in 1986 and coral died two years 
later but their influence on this field was absolutely phenomenal and now we get to the 
top five this was not an easy choice but for number five I chose the ufo encounters over 
arizona mines there are more than a dozen of these types of cases in which ufos hover over various 
mines arizona has more of these types of encounters than any other state I could find 
it's had a very profound influence on the field provides some very interesting insights I think 
into the et agenda and that's why I gave it slot number five on this list arizona as it turns out 
is the leading producer of copper in the united states and there are more than a dozen cases of 
ufos hovering over mines this is more than any other state it's clear that this is an agenda 
these cases are really uniquely arizonan and uh so many cases involving not only sightings but 
landings and humanoids so this is a really interesting aspect of arizona ufo encounters 
so let's just get into some of these amazing cases one occurred on march 6 1980 in warren arizona 
when witnesses saw a disc hovering over the mine tailings in this mine at warren arizona this disc 
turned on its edge flew to the south and was gone the entire sighting lasted eight minutes and it 
was clear to the witnesses that this object was interested in the mines another very interesting 
case occurred at the green valley copper mine this was on august 20th 1988 a married couple 
were driving near their home which is right by the mine this is an abandoned mine and they saw this 
glowing red and yellow cylinder hovering above the mine tailings and the moment they saw it this 
object began to move back and forth getting closer and then farther away appearing and disappearing 
when suddenly it zoomed towards them and was only 50 feet away so they got a very good view 
of it and could see that it was thin and tall like a tower they said and was glowing with 
a neon type light both witnesses felt it was almost alive it impressed them so much that they 
reported it to mufon so many cases here's one that occurred on december 28 2001 
at a gold mine near tucson there's a gentleman whose name is barry and I'll just quote barry 
directly as barry says I am a regular guy I'm a four-year veteran of the army I have an 
associate's degree in structural engineering and an advanced degree in heavy equipment operation 
so he was working at this site next to this gold mine in tucson working on the night shift 
using a track hoe to feed an incinerator he had a co-worker with him who was a retired 
special forces major and as they're working suddenly this immense craft which they described 
is about a mile long covered with weird lights appeared over this gold mine nearby 
and this really impressed barry and as barry says and I quote my esteemed colleague got a deathly 
white sheen to his face and would not come out of his personal jeep he was scared and he was 
battling like a child me I turned the trackhoe to face it the ufo and kept flicking my daylighters 
in the hope that they could come and see who was behind those lights I felt at ease no panic you 
see I felt as though these were my friends like we had met before this object began to disappear 
and reappear but as barry says it was quote never too far from this gold mine it was hovering over 
finally it moved off and was gone the very next night two military attack cobra helicopters 
hovered over the site and when they remained for over an hour barry turned on the floodlights 
at that point the helicopters circled the site and headed directly towards that gold mine barry says 
and apparently they were interested in this sighting that had occurred the day before 
two weeks later barry's co-worker the special forces major quit and made it very clear to barry that he never wanted to talk about what happened 
barry was very impressed and reported this setting to new fork just a short time later 
and here's another case june 14 1953 this occurred at the open pit copper mine in silver bell arizona 
around sundown a group of rodeo cowboys observed a huge globe-shaped object hovering over this open 
pit mine they first thought it was a balloon but decided that no it wasn't because it was hovering 
in place it was aluminum and pure in appearance and quite large about a hundred feet wide 
finally it began to move it moved over copper buttes and hovered there then streaked away very 
quickly turning a deep blue green then it slowed down and stopped over nearby elroy and at this 
point resumed its metallic appearance some of the witnesses got out their binoculars and observed it 
and suddenly this object winked out but again all of them were impressed that this object 
was very interested in the open pit copper mine at silverbell another case occurred at page 
arizona at the zantelli western mining company this occurred on the evening of june 3rd 1964 
and one of the witnesses was the foreman of the mine a gentleman by the name of edward coyle 
who said he saw a reddish glowing egg-shaped object about 500 to 1 000 feet over the mine 
he watched it for just a few moments when it started to move off to the northwest he notified 
the owners of the mine patton june patterson and it turned out later that night there was another 
witness frank howard the night watchman of the mine saw the same or another similar object moving 
off to the south of the mine so there's another case of these ufos investigating these mines 
and here's another interesting series of events in which ufos visited the same area on at least three 
separate occasions over a period of decades this is near the mines in pima arizona the first case 
occurred just after midnight on july 22nd 1971 when an anonymous witness saw a flat disk with 
a teardrop shaped tail and a bluish glowing light around his exterior he estimated it was moving at 
about 45 miles per hour over the waste dumps of the mine in pima this is 30 miles south of tucson 
as he watched this craft rocked back and forth was clearly under intelligent control he watched it 
dart at right angles and finally zip away and he admits he actually saw this ufo on another 
occasion a few days earlier and he was absolutely convinced it was coming to investigate this mine 
another case occurred about nine years later in november of 1980 the witness was george parks who 
worked the night shift at the bhp copper mines in san manuel and driving home from work one evening 
he had an amazing very close-up ufo sighting and I'll just quote george directly as he says 
coming around the bend at oracle junction I saw a metallic craft hovering not far from the road 
and I saw seven windows behind every window stood a figure in an instant later it flew off 
so it turns out george parks was in the military for more than 20 years and he says he never saw anything like that in all his time in the military this sighting 
inspired him to join mufon and he became a field investigator and before long he became the pima 
county section director for mufon and later the mufon arizona state director 
so this really changed his life and as he says and I quote I'm still looking for answers 
and it was some 37 years later when there was yet another sighting over this same area this 
next sighting occurred on august 29 2017 and it's a very interesting sighting because the witness 
was in a jet flying from san diego california to atlanta georgia and was flying over arizona at 
about 35 000 feet and he's looking down through the window and he could see the open pit copper 
mine in pima arizona and as he says and I quote I noticed a disc at low altitude near the mine 
it was a saucer-shaped disk it stood out in the train just hovering so many cases I'm telling you 
the ufos are absolutely interested in these mines there are two cases which occurred at the lavender 
pit copper mine the first one occurred quite some time ago on june 27 1947 this is just about 
one week before the very famous roswell ufo crash the main witness is john pech he's an electrician 
employed at the phelps dodge copper mine in bisbee arizona he and two other workers said they saw 
a silver mirror like disc and it was silent wobbling and just moved slowly overhead and 
meanwhile a mile and a half away three other mine employees including john rylance mr l w maxwell 
and milton luna saw in this same object moving lower and lower until it actually landed on this 
little hill at the mine the gang boss for the mine crew his name is vernon c mcminn said that other 
people at the mine had also observed the object and described the same thing these other witnesses 
had seen and there were more witnesses to this event there was a gentleman by the name of major 
george b wilcox he was a us army officer and he says he observed eight or nine light-colored 
disc shaped craft moving at low elevation over the bisbee area at the same time of this mine sighting 
he said the objects were evenly spaced in single file and moved with a dipping rocking motion and 
it was many years later in the 1980s when this same mine was visited again the anonymous witness 
was a former rocket scientist who worked as a telemetry collector and analyst for the nsa 
and at this time he was at a gas station next to the lavender pit copper mine in bisbee 
when this metallic oblate spheroid object about 100 feet in diameter hovered 250 feet overhead 
he said it was silent except for a low humming noise he turned to the gas station owner and 
said do you see that and the gas station owner replied I sure do he said it was so 
low he had the impulse to throw a rock at it but decided that probably wasn't a good idea 
both witnesses felt they were being observed by the ufo occupants and they weren't the only 
witnesses cars were driving by they would slow down look at it and then speed off 
as the witness says nobody stopped although they could be seen leaning down and forward briefly to 
get a better look so they watched this for several moments at which point the object moved directly 
over the mine itself then accelerated the to the west toward the queen mine at bisbee at this point 
jet fighters appeared obviously chasing this object they were only a few hundred feet high 
and as the witness says our government knows about these things who's kidding who here 
probably the most amazing series of events like this occurred at the morenci copper smelting 
plants one amazing case occurred on october 23rd 1980 when five men at the morenci's plant observed 
a large dull black boomerang-shaped object approaching the smokestacks of the morenci 
copper smelting plant this object hovered over the smokestacks and actually began sending down 
a brilliant beam of light into each smokestack and then one of them dropped a small fireball or 
a probe into one of the smokestacks one of the men his name was joe navares made a mental wish asking 
for this object to return so he could get a better look at it and it did it pulled a quick u-turn 
and hovered much closer so they all got a better look at it and off it moved off into the distance 
so this incident got a lot of publicity it was investigated by the international center for ufo research a small ufo group located in scottsdale and they said that throughout the 
1980s a huge boomerang-shaped object described as nearly a half mile wide would appear repeatedly 
over morenci morenci is a little mining town and on a few occasions this object was witnessed 
by literally hundreds of people for example more than a hundred students at the morenci high school 
observed this object and described it as being several football fields in size 
and there's another case involving a humanoid at the morenci copper mine this occurred on august 11 2017 not too long ago and I will just quote a friend of the witness 
as this anonymous gentleman says and I quote at work in a copper mine in morenci arizona a 
friend of mine saw this bright light through the window he went outside and took a picture 
a few years days later while showing the picture to a friend it was enlarged and you could make 
out a small human-like figure on the left side of the glowing object the fence in the 
picture is about six feet high and according to the witness behind this fence there is a 
slope which drops down to around 100 feet so it's a difficult area to
traverse so apparently they did not notice this humanoid figure and you can make of it what you 
will uh but it's definitely a very interesting report and yet another encounter over these 
copper mines in arizona and now we move to number four for number four I chose the ufo hot spot 
of sedona there are many hot spots all across the united states and sedona is definitely one of the 
most active areas in the united states if not on this entire planet the number of encounters coming 
out of here is phenomenal so that's why I gave it the number four slot on this list I'm not going 
to be able to tell you all the encounters that have happened there there's far too many but I would like to give you a little bit of a rundown of some of the more interesting sightings landings 
uh some abduction cases photographic cases I mean it's just incredible what's going on at sedona 
so that's why I gave it the number four spot on this list sedona is very easily the most active area in all of arizona 
and there have been literally hundreds of cases of not only sightings but landings 
face-to-face encounters abductions I mean you name it it's happened in sedona it would be impossible 
to cover all the cases that have gone on there so I would like to cover just a small selection of 
some of the sightings landings and abductions that have taken place there and lots of photographs too 
uh in 1986 there was a huge wave of sightings and some of these were really interesting accounts 
for example on may 11 1986 a minister and private pilot by the name of robert 
henderson was flying with his wife in a cessna and uh they were over verdi valley in sedona when they 
saw a bright flash of light ahead of them and it quickly approached their plane on what he thought 
was a collision course and he was just getting prepared to take evasive action when this object 
which he said was a half sphere with the flat side down passed at very high speeds to the left of his 
plane and darted off another very interesting case that occurred during this wave 
involved a woman who lived in sedona and she was preparing dinner one evening when suddenly there 
was a huge bright light which illuminated the interior of her house and all the area outside 
of it she ran outside and saw this huge disc shaped object larger than her house 
moving only a few hundred feet overhead it moved slowly up in nearby canyon and then disappeared
another really interesting case involves a gentleman by the name of stan who said during 
and throughout 1986 he saw this red and white object hovering over his home in the loy butte 
area and usually it was some distance off but one evening it flew directly toward him and stopped 
very low overhead and looking up he could see that the red part of the ufo was actually a spherical 
light attached underneath it and at this point the red light detached swooped down and circled 
several times over his home as though probing it and then this light darted back upwards attached 
to the larger white object and both promptly flew off and away to the west again in 1986 
a father and son were hiking on airport mesa in sedona when they saw a large silver shaped object 
hovering between the thunder clouds overhead they watched it for 10 minutes it was perfectly 
stationary and then became lost in the clouds so many cases another really interesting case 
occurred to a cottonwood resident who was driving over the mingus mountains in sedona when she saw 
a group of glowing orange spheres of light moving in procession and then seconds later she saw three 
military helicopters chasing these objects it was a short sighting but once again betrays 
our government's interest in these ufos another case during this 1986 wave occurred on december 
19 when a family in sedona was driving near doe mountain and they saw what they first thought 
was a helicopter but it turned out it wasn't it was a brilliant sphere of light emitting 
a rainbow array of prismatic colors and as they watched this thing rocketed straight 
upwards until it was a tiny point of light way high up there and disappeared into the clouds 
another 1986 case involved a couple and a friend who were driving at night near the mongolian rim 
when their headlights failed and at that moment they saw a glowing triangular shaped ufo hovering 
500 feet above their car and it remained in place for five minutes before moving to the west 
now here's a very interesting case which was investigated by tom dongle 
he is a arizona resident and has actually written a series of books about ufo encounters 
in the sedona area and this witness was a major part he was a major for us airlines and in 1986 
he was driving on highway 89a from sedona to prescott and as he passed the mingus mountains 
he saw strange flashes of light and as tom dongle writes he left his car to investigate 
the area and in the side canyon he saw a landed disc shaped craft sitting on the ground and 
three humanoid beings walking around it the three humanoids were aware of him immediately 
and one of them raised an arm high in a gesture of greeting the pilot became rather unhinged at 
that point and made a dash for his car so he ran into his car and raced down the highway trying 
to get away and the next thing he knows this disc comes swooping down and hovers directly 
in front of his vehicle as though trying to stop him but after a few minutes it darted quickly away 
he drives to his home in prescott and calls a friend who is a well-known politician 
and after telling his story the politician asked the pilot if he wanted to report his encounter 
to the air force the pilot agreed and soon found himself on board a special air force jet 
heading directly to wright-patterson air force base in ohio and upon arrival he 
was placed inside a room for a half an hour until finally an air force officer arrived 
and told him that no questions would be asked of him and without any other delay the pilot 
was flown back to prescott in another air force jet so as you can see I mean this just shows how 
deeply interested our military was in this subject so many other cases 
and some involve photographs many for example in the fall of 1988 four tourists were hiking 
on bell rock when they saw three disc shaped objects hovering in formation overhead they 
allegedly took photos of these objects which quickly darted west to the apache mountains 
one year later spring of 1989 two visitors were in a hotel in sedona and saw a ufo hovering over 
schnebly hill this object stopped ejected a red sphere which danced around the larger object 
and then reattached itself to the original object and darted away in 1989 same year a married couple 
saw this odd egg-shaped cloud hovering over the town of sedona when suddenly three large green 
spheres dropped from the cloud and each of these spears moved off in three separate directions 
one sedona researcher dr patricia rochelle diego interviewed a woman by the name of dorial 
who was driving home along the back roads of sedona around 1990 when she says a disc 
shaped object flew only a few yards in front of her right above the road it turns out her husband 
was driving behind her in a separate car and she slowed down hoping her husband would catch up 
but when she slowed down so did the ufo she slowed down even further so did this object and 
she approached her home in oak creek and finally her husband appears behind her and this object 
takes off straight up she told her husband what had happened he said that he had also seen the 
object and thought at first it was a shooting star until he saw this thing move straight up 
and disappear but what's interesting about this case is according to dr deagle this is not unusual 
and that she has investigated more than 36 similar cases involving people who have encountered ufos 
along the back roads of sedona and she says their descriptions of the encounter are very similar 
to dorials in which these objects come swooping down and follow these cars right over the highway 
so yeah many people have photographed these objects another photographic case occurred 
on august 14 2003 when a man and his wife were driving through sedona taking pictures of the 
landscape they saw nothing unusual at the time but upon downloading their images into their computer 
they saw what appeared to be a small bubble type craft and it was just a few days later 
when they were talking to construction workers at their home and these construction workers saw the 
photo and freaked out because it turned out that a few days earlier apparently at the same time they 
had had a flat tire on this same road and observed the same object that the couple had photographed 
so as you can see here's the photo of this object and again cases involving landing and humanoids 
sometime in the late 1980s a woman by the name of susan bedell invited her niece laura to stay 
at her home in sedona laura was sleeping on the couch when she heard banging noises in the kitchen 
and saw lights and was freaking out when suddenly a glowing light appeared six feet in front of her 
it expanded lengthwise and took the form of a small humanoid creature and according to 
the witness this object had a disproportionately large head gray skin large slanted almond eyes and 
a body that seemed too frail to hold it up so a typical gray laura stared at this being for just a 
few moments it stared back at her and then slowly vanished another case this one was all landing 
uh one evening the date is not given in this case a retired couple was watching tv in their 
sedona home and looking out their window they saw a blue white light fall to the ground near 
their property they lived in a pretty remote area and they thought it was a plane that had crashed 
so they ran to the site and instead of finding a crash site they saw a landed ufo the object was 
quite large disc shaped and around it were several small figures with large heads gathering samples 
from the surrounding area bongo investigated this case and as he writes and I quote 
the woman uttered some sort of cry a sound that attracted the attention of the little man 
realizing they had been seen the couple turned and ran as fast as their legs would carry them 
as they struggled over the crest of a low hill they were hit in the back and knocked down by 
something that caused searing pain the couple then lost consciousness when the couple came to 
it was now midday and they were three miles from where they had been the night before 
to their further consternation they discovered they had fresh scars and marks on their body 
another alarming case occurred on may 7 1993 when a group of about 10 people were hiking 
in the schnebly hill area of sedona it was around dusk when they saw two helicopters 
hovering next to a rock formation they stopped to watch as did a small crowd of people when 
suddenly the rock face appeared to disappear and become a cave-like opening and at that 
instant several lighted objects shot out of the cave flew erratically and were gone 
this cave opening then closed up the helicopters hovered for a few more minutes and then departed 
the woman reported her case to new fork and as she writes and I quote I still don't know exactly what 
we all saw but it was definitely something we had never before imagined or could deny 
so perhaps there's a base there there are many rumors of a base in the superstition mountains 
but yeah not just sightings and landings in many cases of humanoids and abductions here's another 
very interesting case involving a humanoid this occurred to a lady whose home overlooked bell rock 
and it was a clear beautiful day july 12 2009 and the witness was in her dining room working at a 
computer when movement from outside caught her eye and she looked and got a real shock 
uh as she says I got up and went out to the patio and realized it was a humanoid 
figure without a power pack of any sort it flew from the far left of lee mountain 
she wasn't the only witness she called another person out who was in the house and they both watched this flying humanoid as it flew in a horizontal path without any sways or dips they 
said they're absolutely sure this was a humanoid and they kept this experience to themselves 
because it was so bizarre but finally one of them reported this case to mufon another case involving 
an abduction occurred in 1976 to a gentleman by the name of frank ramsey who was visiting 
a ranch near loy butte in sedona he was taking pictures of the sunset when he looked up and saw 
a ufo which he described as a bright white sphere about 30 to 40 feet off the ground so he quickly 
went to get his camera at this point the object blinked out and reappeared some distance away 
and then it returned and began blinking and away and disappearing it moved back and forth 
finally this was freaking frank ramsay out and he made a run back towards the 
ranch and was almost there when suddenly he saw this object again and actually what he 
saw was a figure standing on the hillside waving a light at him and he first thought it was someone 
at the ranch one of his friends and he turned his flashlight and moved towards the figure 
and at this point he saw that his friends were actually driving up the road to the ranch and so he turns back to this figure which was now about a hundred feet away and he could see that 
this figure was standing next to a bright white sphere as he watched a door opened in this sphere 
you could see inside and this figure itself also appeared to glow and realizing he was seeing a 
landed ufo and its occupant he turned to run away but became paralyzed next thing he knows 
he had missing time the object and the figure are gone and frank ramsey found himself standing 
still with his camera in a completely different location in fact he was quite far from where he 
had been more than a mile and a half away and it took him almost an hour to make his way back 
and meanwhile while walking back he started to remember what happened as he says and I quote 
i have a memory of being inside that sphere I remember looking out a porthole type window and I remember seeing stars outside of it he also remembered what this being looked like 
and he described it as short with very large dark eyes another abduction occurred in may of 1981 
when a lady by the name of nancy was in her home in sedona she felt a powerful vibration ran outside and saw this huge object hovering above her house it was larger than an 
aircraft carrier a dull metallic color and a huge glowing dome on top and it was one year 
later that she was camping with her daughter and granddaughter in faye canyon in sedona they saw 
a glowing disc hovering and later that night they were in their tent when they were visited 
by a small entity which grabbed nancy's arm and took her and the others from the tent she doesn't 
remember what happened next only that the creature was speaking inside her head telling her that they 
were rearranging her molecular structure for the purpose of facilitating communication and travel 
and here's one final case which took place in sedona involving a possible ufo crash a couple 
were in sedona when the wife noticed a very bright starlight light in the north west sky 
but it was too bright to be a star and suddenly this beam of light struck this object from the east and as they watched this object flared up and exploded and began to float down 
and two hours later they had friends in west sedona who called them to say that there was a fire burning west of highway 89a in an area known as secret canyon 
the next day they went to the local coffee house and heard people talking about this fire and one couple said that an hour before this fire was reported they saw what was apparently this 
same object a small flaming object fall into secret canyon and they believed this was the 
cause of the fire and this is when other witnesses began to talk and rumors were swirling around town 
because this fire was in a pretty remote area and the fire department decided they were not going to 
fight it but let it burn out and it burned for the next 10 days the whole canyon was closed off 
and the firefighters only fought this fire when it started to come close to resorts in oak creek 
canyon but secret canyon according to these witnesses was closed for three months during 
which other residents in the area said they saw military trucks driving in and out of the area 
and the witness also heard reports of hikers including two police officers who were exploring the area but were turned back by military men in black uniforms and m16 rifles 
so was this a ufo crash retrieval hard to say it wasn't officially investigated 
but it just fits in with the huge amount of activity that's going on in sedona 
sedona is definitely arizona's biggest ufo hotspot and perhaps one of the biggest hot spots in the 
united states or even the world there are more than three different organizations companies 
that offer ufo tours and a huge number of photographic cases as I mentioned this is a very 
active area and has had a huge influence on our understanding of ufos and that's why I gave it 
case slot number four on this list and now we get to the top three and if you know anything about 
ufos you could probably predict what the top three are going to be but for top for space number three 
i chose ufo crash at paradise valley also known as the kingman ufo crash there are only a handful 
of really credible ufo crash retrieval accounts and this one that happened in paradise valley 
is definitely one of them and absolutely arizona's most famous ufo crash so that's why I gave it 
number three on this list and that's really a fascinating case as we shall see frank scully's 
explosive book behind the flying saucers was not only the first ufo book published but it was the 
first to talk about crashed ufos and the first to mention the paradise valley crash in arizona 
according to scully's sources they told him that they were actually in the phoenix area 
when this crash occurred and his paradise valley was just north of phoenix they arrived at the site 
shortly after it occurred and on the scene they found a smallish craft which they said was about 
36 feet in diameter and there were two deceased extraterrestrials as scully writes and I quote one 
of the little men was half out of the escape door or hatch as the doctor called it the little man 
was dead the other little fellow there being only a crew of two on the ship was sitting in his seat 
at the control board he was also dead so that was the first leak in this case and the next leak came 
from researcher richard hall way back in 1964 and richard hall spoke with a gentleman who was soon 
to be a commander in vietnam so a good witness and this gentleman told richard hall that back in 1953 
a ufo crashed in arizona and according to him there were four bodies recovered 
and the craft was described as about 30 feet in diameter and undamaged and as richard hall says 
i could not imagine a less likely hoaxer the third big break in the case came from highly 
respected researcher raymond fowler best known for his research into betty andreason 
and he spoke with a first-hand witness uh this witness initially used the pseudonym fritz werner and signed an affidavit uh attesting to 
the truth of his testimony we now know that this man's true name was arthur g stancil 
who was an engineer manager at the air material command at wright-patterson air force base in ohio
arthur stancil worked directly with a gentleman by the name of dr eric henry wang who we know 
was the head of the department of special studies at wright patterson and one day dr wang approached 
arthur stancil and said that a ufo had crashed nearby in arizona as it turns out arthur was in 
arizona at the time so arthur stancil was ordered to go to this ufo crash site with a group of about 
40 other scientists to assist in the recovery of this object arthur stancil was told by dr wang 
that this was in fact a ufo and it was arthur's job to calculate the velocity and trajectory of 
the disk based on its structure how deeply had burrowed into the ground and the whole blast 
pattern he was taken to the site on a bus with blacked out windows and was told to concentrate 
only on his assigned duties and do not look around upon arrival arthur stensel says he saw a 30-foot 
oval object constructed of an unbrushed metal which resembled brushed aluminum 
he said the disc was undamaged and had penetrated only 20 inches into the sand he said he saw 
a hatch about three and a half feet high no apparent landing gear he made his measurements 
and studied the area and concluded that the craft had struck the ground at about 1200 miles per hour 
he also concluded the craft was not human made as he says and I quote the object was not built by 
anything obviously that we know about on earth it was more like a tear drip drop 
shaped cigar like a streamlined cigar I managed to glance inside at one point and saw the dead body 
of a four foot human-like creature in a silver metallic suit the skin on its face was dark 
brown stencil says that all the other scientists were escorted one by one to perform their duties 
and then were returned to the bus and afterwards an air force colonel made them sign an official 
secrets act uh making them all swear under oath never to reveal what they had seen 
arthur stancil did speak with another scientist who said he was able to look inside the object itself and said he saw two small swivel seats and a strange instrument panel that was basically it 
the next big break in the case come came from researcher leonard stringfield known for his 
crash retrieval investigations and this witness says that he was taken in april or may of 1953 
to a desert area to examine the crash of a flying saucer so the timeline fits and so do the details 
because this witness described the object as 30 feet in diameter it had no apparent damage 
he was not allowed to enter the ship but he said he did see a hatchway about four feet tall and 
two feet wide and it was his job to analyze the metal he was at the site for two days 
and after his tests concluded that the object was definitely not constructed on earth 
years later in 1977 stringfield was giving a lecture about this crash when someone in 
the audience approached him a national guard employee who said that he was there back in 1953 
actually he was stationed at wright-patterson air force base in ohio when a group of crates 
arrived from a ufo crash that had come from arizona so presumably this was the paradise 
valley kingman crash and the crates he learned contained three humanoid bodies four feet tall 
large heads brownish skin and each was packed in dry ice to preserve it and one of the bodies 
he was told was female and he learned that some of the other crates contained debris which apparently 
had sanskrit like symbols etched into them the witness refused to make a written statement 
he did ask his superiors if he could leave a written statement to be opened upon his death 
but his superiors emphatically denied the request but he still spoke he was another 
whistleblower who confirms this crash here's another very interesting tidbit of information 
that confirms this crash it comes from a lady by the name of judy wolcott whose husband revealed 
that he participated in this incident he was on duty at the air control tower at kingman 
when he and other personnel tracked this object on radar and they watched as it quickly lost altitude 
disappeared from their scopes and moments later there was a huge flash of light in the distance 
outside the city so he and a group of other men jumped into their jeeps and drove to where 
this object had impacted the ground and they were approaching this area when they saw this 
large object often the distance partially embedded in the sandy soil 
you couldn't see any bodies at this distance but you could tell that the object did not appear to be damaged and they were about to approach it more closely when military officials arrived and 
ordered them off the site he was taken back to the base and told that nothing had happened they had 
seen nothing they were ordered not to speak about it but there was a lot of rumors that he heard and 
that he did hear that there were other witnesses who had seen alien bodies so he kept this secret 
but 10 years after the incident while serving in vietnam he wrote a letter to his wife judy 
and detailed this incident and it was one year later he was killed in action in vietnam another 
possible confirmation of this incident comes from lyndon moulton howe who said that she met 
with the infamous richard doty of the afosi this was on april 9 1983 at kirtland air force base 
and she saw a document which actually referenced that there had been a ufo crash in kingman arizona 
at this time another whistleblower is bill ewhaus who says that this disc was not a crash so much 
as it was a landing as he says this et craft was a controlled craft that the aliens wanted 
to present to our government it landed about 15 miles from what used to be an army base which is 
now a defunct army base and according to him the first soldiers to enter the craft became nauseous 
and disoriented and when they exited the craft they had missing time they could not remember even going inside the craft according to u house this craft was actually transported to area 51. 
he said it made loud humming noises the whole time which really concerned the military as he 
says the military didn't know what to do they weren't sure if it was going to explode or what 
so they left it sitting out in the open on the tarmac for nine months I don't know 
uh I'll I just provide this testimony for what it's worth another controversial and 
perhaps questionable testimony comes from len castin who says that uh this craft did occur 
but actually contained live aliens who survived it and they ended up working closely with the us 
military and he says that this paradise valley ufo became the model to reverse engineer other 
ufos and that the et's allegedly assisted in helping the military scientists to understand and 
use the craft I don't know this is controversial testimony and I present it for what it's worth 
one final witness is robert carr who was a very vocal early whistleblower talking about ufo crash 
retrievals and really no one else was he was an expert in non-verbal communication was apparently 
one of the scientists in the know when it came to crashed saucers and he was very tight-lipped 
usually refused to give interviews but did grant an interview to researcher gray barker and he 
revealed facts about the paradise valley ufo as carr says the other wreck was found that summer in 
the desert in arizona by visual observation this one was burned and it had been out there in the 
desert for too long there were organic materials left but the predators in the heat of the desert 
had pretty well taken care of the occupants but they scooped it up and took it along 
so as you can see there's quite a bit of evidence for this case which is why I gave it spot number 
three and now we move to case number two and this was actually a really easy choice for number two 
i chose the ufo abduction of travis walton this is one of the most famous and well-known 
and credible ufo abduction cases on record and it's quite well known so 
i'm not going to go into too much detail about the parts that have been covered 
by many other researchers but I do think I have some interesting and unique uh stories to tell you 
which you may not have heard before so let's just get started on november 5 1975 a group of seven 
young men all woodcutters were working in the apache-sitgreaves national forest in the mongolian 
rim area not far from snowflake they had been thinning trees all day and were returning 
home and it was around 7 15 when they came upon this glow through the trees and as they 
approached they were shocked to see a cleanly structured craft with glowing panels of light 
and travis walton who had the door seat in the front jumped out and ran under this object 
he said it was making a high-pitched sound and uh he started now the other people in the truck were 
freaking out and calling for him to come back and so travis walton was about to return and at this 
point he's standing up and next thing he knows he felt a powerful jolt and fell unconscious and 
back in the truck all the other witnesses watched as this blazing beam of light shot out from the 
bottom of the craft struck travis on the chest and send sent him flying backwards to the ground 
uh so this completely freaked them out they were hysterical and panicking and very afraid and they 
screamed at mike rogers who was the crew chief and driving the truck to get away mike wanted to scoop 
travis up first uh but the men were panicking they were all afraid so they drove off and got 
out of view of this object and pulled over and they were discussing what had happened and what 
to do according to mike rogers he looked up and saw this object apparently this object 
quickly dart away he shouted out to the other witnesses but no one else saw it at this point 
they returned to the site travis was of course missing they searched the area called for his 
name they could not find him this was absolutely freaking them out and they returned to go to the 
police meanwhile back in the town of snowflake residents apparently were reporting some unusual 
electromagnetic disturbances according to mufon field investigator willard 
d nelson he interviewed a witness who says that at the time of travis's encounter 
her tv failed as she says and I quote I remember it because it made me mad I was trying to watch 
the six o'clock news and the picture went out for about 20 minutes right after 6 15. 
we thought the power had gone off but we checked that and a lady in heber told me that she lost 
the picture too but they had a different power company so it wasn't a power outage 
and later when the walton story broke in the news both witnesses realized the their tv disturbances 
had occurred on the same night very close to the same time so meanwhile back at the abduction 
site mike rogers and the others could not find travis and they drove directly to the police 
they told their stories to deputies ellison and flake and to sheriff gillespie and under sheriff 
copeland and the police insisted on returning to the site some of the men were too afraid to go 
but the police insisted so alan dallas kenneth peterson and mike rogers returned 
while dwayne smith steve pierce and john goulet stayed behind back at the site they searched for 
walton could not find any trace of him so this case immediately came to the attention of ufo 
researchers and william spalding of ground saucer watch investigated the area and according to him 
magnetic readings at the site were several times higher than normal otherwise he could not find any 
other evidence the police interviewed the men who were clearly sincere and very emotionally upset 
they wondered if it was a hoax but they didn't think so because the men were crying and very 
upset and they asked the wood cutters the witnesses to take lie detector tests they 
all agreed and each of them easily passed except for one of them who was too emotionally upset 
and according to the gentleman who conducted the polygraph tests psy gilson they were all 
telling the truth as he says and I quote I think they did see something they believed was a ufo 
i gotta say they passed the test so the media of course heard about this case and 
a ton of snowflake was besieged by reporters ufo organizations ufo hunters it was complete mayhem 
and while the search for walton continued they could not find any sign of him 
they were sure that the men were probably telling the truth because of how sincere and emotional 
they were everyone who interviewed them was very much impressed as sheriff chuck ellison 
says and I quote one of the men was weeping if they were lying they were damn good actors
so while the investigation is going on and the men are beginning to be suspected of committing 
murder uh travis walton last thing he remembered was being struck by this 
uh electrical beam he didn't actually see the beam he just remembers feeling this jolt and passing out and he woke up lying on his back and saw lights above him he was in quite 
a bit of pain disoriented and struggling for consciousness and as he looked up he saw figures 
around him fussing with his clothes and he remembered seeing this ufo and he thought 
oh I must have gotten hurt and now I'm in a hospital and he kept trying to wake up and focus 
and finally his vision cleared and he got a terrible shock the people he thought were doctors in a hospital were not they were alien looking figures there were three of them five 
feet tall with large oversized bald heads and luminous brown eyes the size of quarters he said 
each wore a featureless jumpsuit you completely panic jumped up and pushed one of the figures away 
he said it had a very marshmallow like texture very soft he looked around and saw this little 
metal bench with these weird instruments on it he grabbed what looked like a clear 
glass-like tube and began swinging at the figures each of whose quickly exited the room 
and they went to the left he saw so he quickly exited the room and turned in the 
other direction to the right and walked down this curving metal gray corridor and came upon 
another small room with a little chair with weird controls in the center 
and he walked up to it into a shock the walls around the room became transparent there were 
little controls and screens on the armrests of this chair so he fiddled with them for a second and the stars began moving that freaked him out so he began searching the room for a doorway 
when suddenly a figure appeared at the doorway a male human looking figure he described it as tall 
muscular good looking with golden hazel eyes and brown hair and wearing a tight-fitting blue suit 
and a transparent helmet and walton's first thought that this was a normal human being 
and he quickly asked questions this man completely ignored travis and instead grabbed him by the arm 
led him from the room down the corridor into a really small elevator-like room a door opened 
and they walked out and travis was shocked to find himself walking out of this craft which 
had taken him into a hangar in which there were at least two or three other similar craft and 
he's like wow I'm inside of a mother ship and uh this figure led walton across this hangar to 
another small room where there were two men and a woman all who had the same general appearance 
and they laid him out on a table put this mask-like device over his face and he passed out 
next thing he knows he's waking up alongside a highway and this craft is above him and darting 
away he recognized the area he was more than 20 miles from where he had been originally taken he 
ran down the highway to where he knew there was a group of three phone booths and called his family 
so meanwhile on the same exact night of travis's re-appearance 
a lady was driving through this area when she saw something amazing and I'll just quote this witness 
directly as she says I was traveling back from las vegas with two friends around midnight 12 miles 
from winslow heading east a truck driver ahead was stopped on the highway and there was this 
bluish glow everywhere in the desert at that time I stopped and a huge blue fireball was descending 
across the highway about one mile ahead of my car according to this witness this object 
moved downward in a very slow controlled manner and went behind a desert mesa everything became 
dark though there was no evidence of any crash or explosion and she's like wow is that a ufo 
she left the area drove onto albuquerque only to learn a week later that travis walton had 
reappeared on the very same night of their sighting in the same apparent location and 
as she says and I quote did I see the ship that dropped him off so there's possible confirmation 
there meanwhile travis's disappearance for five days uh had sent shock waves through the community 
of snowflake and beyond and uh people were wondering if he would ever return of course the 
woodcutters were being accused of murder which they denied and then travis reappeared and this caused an explosion like an atom bomb of press attention at first 
the walton family told nobody of travis's return travis was extremely traumatized he 
could not believe he had mis been missing for five days all he remembered was about 15 minutes 
so they rushed him off to the doctor in tucson to examine him and according to 
the doctor travis was in good health though he had lost 10 pounds they then called the police 
the police conducted an investigation gave travis a lie detector test which he agreed to and he 
passed he was examined by a psychiatrist by the name of gene rosenbaum this was one day later and 
according to gene rosenbaum and I quote this young man is not lying there is no collusion involved 
no attempt to hoax there is no evidence of drugs in this issue he really believes these things 
so at this point two ufo organizations apro and the ground saucer watch both wanted to 
investigate uh what travis walton chose apro and he was interviewed by dr james harder 
and jim lorenzen who became absolutely convinced of the authenticity of walton's case this case 
became very well known hundreds of articles appeared in newspapers all over the world some 
skeptical others supportive some were accurate but many of them were almost completely fabricated his 
phone ran off the hook it was so bad he actually got rid of his phone he had multiple offers for 
interviews movie off authors he started receiving threats all kinds of weird accusations of hoaxes 
i mean the case was just going wild the national enquirer heard about their case and
a report was submitted to them and they did in fact win an award for the best 
case of the year they each got a check and this brought in more accusations of a hoax 
so lots of controversy was still surrounding this case within a year of it a journalist by the name of bill berry wrote a book about this encounter called the ultimate encounter 
and travis was still getting requests for interviews and seeing how badly his case was being misrepresented and watching other people profit from it 
he decided he would write a book and this was called the walton incident and it later 
was rewritten into a new book called fire in the sky which was also made into a really good movie 
in fact the movie was very accurate except for the on-board segment which was largely fictionalized 
at any rate this case remained a classic no one has ever been able to prove it was a hoax 
travis walton said it completely transformed his life and it wasn't always uh good news as he says 
it will always be there it changed everything all in all I've lost badly from this thing 
uh people have accused him of a hoax phil class tried very hard to debunk his case 
but no one has been able to provide any solid evidence that this was a hoax 
and in fact several of the people the witnesses were offered substantial sums of money to say that it was a hoax and they did not take these offers 
uh walton was hypnotized to see if he could recall the missing five days he could not and uh 
that is where the case remains uh walton does not know why he was taken he hasn't had any encounters 
since as he says so far as I know I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and too 
curious for my own good recently there's been more controversy about this case when there was 
a dispute between mike rogers and travis walton over money involving their story mike rogers some 
people said detracted his statement and said that this was a hoax mike rogers said that no that's 
not true he still stands by this case and in fact there was a recent award-winning documentary which 
is titled travis by producer director jennifer w stein it's won multiple awards as I mentioned 
and all the witnesses are still standing by this case they've they gave very compelling interviews 
and this case still remains one of the most famous and influential abductions in history 
which is why I gave it the number two spot on this list and now we get to number one 
and number one should be easy to guess for number one I chose the phoenix lights this could very 
well be the most widely viewed ufo encounter of modern times up since the modern age of ufos 
and is easily one of the most famous ufo sightings in all of human history it's quite an amazing 
story there have been many books and documentaries that present this case but I just want to give you 
a quick rundown of what happened some interesting and lesser known uh eyewitness testimony reports 
it's just an amazing amazing event which is why I gave it the number one spot on this list march 13 
1997 began normally like any other day in phoenix with no hint that one of the largest 
viewed ufo events in modern history was about to occur the first indication of anything strange 
was when the national ufo reporting center newfork began receiving a flurry of calls 
all across nevada and arizona first call came in at 8 16 from a police officer in paulden 
this is 60 miles north of phoenix he said he saw a cluster of five red lights heading south peter 
davenport the head of new fork took the call two minutes later a witness from prescott phoned in 
his sighting and immediately after that calls started coming in one after another calls came 
from all across arizona from wickenburg from tempe from scottsdale from other areas from chino valley 
dewey cordes junction cave creek by the time this object was moving over 
phoenix the phones at the ufo reporting center were ringing off the hook and thousands of people 
at this point were witnessing this incredible display traffic was stopping on the street 
ball glen ball games stopped in mid play people were running out of stores and homes to stare at 
this incredible spectacle and pretty much all the witnesses agree that this was a very large object 
some felt it was a few miles in length others estimated about a half mile pretty much 
all of them agreed it was very low in the sky a few thousand feet at most 
almost all of them said it was moving very slowly though a few said it did dart around 
and almost nobody heard any sound a few did report hearing a low hum 
so this object apparently moved directly over luke air force base and witnesses who live next to air 
force base said that they saw several jet fighters being scrambled from the base and being vectored 
towards this object it was so large they looked like tiny little gnats they said and according to 
insiders at luke air force base the switchboards were lighting up with callers inquiring about this 
object or objects and at the same time police officers or police stations and radio stations 
across phoenix were also flooded with calls and the whole city was becoming completely electrified 
i'd like to give you just some direct quotes from various witnesses who saw this one was a cement 
truck driver by the name of bill grineer who was hauling a load of cement along interstate 17 when 
he saw these objects going towards phoenix at a pretty low rate and he actually followed them for 
two hours and as he approached phoenix he saw f-16 fighter jets taking off from luke air force base 
and as he says and I quote it was crazy I know those pilots saw it I wish the government would 
just admit it it's like having 50 000 people in a stadium watch a football game and then having 
someone tell us we weren't there I will never be the same again before this if anybody told 
me they'd seen a ufo I would have said yeah and I believe in the tooth fairy so at this point the 
witnesses were numbering in the several thousands so it's going to be impossible to list them all 
the first witnesses started seeing this around 8 pm and an anonymous pilot said he saw these 
lights approaching [ __ ] peak moving off to the southeast at 8 15 a retired general by the 
name of kelly and his wife were in glendale and they said they saw a v-shaped object with seven 
lights and they watched it pass over the highway and they said it made no sound 
10 minutes later at 8 25 a psychiatrist and his wife and their child were driving 
along interstate 10 and they observed this formation of lights about 300 yards across 
passed right over their car at an altitude they estimated about 1500 feet there was no noise but 
each of the witnesses interestingly said that they got a telepathic message telling them not to worry 
about what they were seeing five minutes later mike fortson and his wife in chandler arizona 
watched this object pass right in front of the full moon it was in view for about two minutes 
he estimates that it was at about 1200 feet of altitude moving about 35 miles per hour 
and he thinks it was about a mile in size he says it had a dark black surface which almost 
looked translucent as he says during the whole sighting we never moved our feet there was no 
question in our minds that what we saw was not of this earth people say mike you know maybe you saw 
a b-2 bomber my response was we could land all 40 of our b-2 bombers on the wing of this craft 
another witness was booth gerboth who said that he saw these lights around 8 30 
and was convinced that there were these five amber orbs were in fact connected to a triangular shaped 
object and he saw it one hour later so soon it was becoming clear that there was at least more than 
one object possibly several and that this was a display that would go on over a period of two 
hours one phoenix resident by the name of mr berry told reporters it was pretty incredible what I saw 
i didn't know what it was I just saw lights in the sky in the shape of a big v and I ran in and 
got my binoculars did not look like an aircraft it was moving pretty slow it was big another witness 
was eleven-year-old boy scout tim mcdonald who watched this object for three minutes and told 
reporters it looked like a stealth bomber it was in a triangle and it had three lights 
it was there for two or three minutes when it disappeared I thought it was a ufo another group 
of witnesses was done in grace of phoenix and they said this object was definitely solid and v-shaped 
with seven lights and constructed of what they thought were gray panels and to their amazement 
as they watched one of these lights detached from the structure itself flew to the right 
and then returned and re attached itself to this object another witness seth adams says and I quote 
it was one of the biggest things I've ever seen that moved like that I mean it was just enormous I 
don't know if it was as big as an aircraft carrier it might have been because i've never seen an 
aircraft carrier fly another witness with stacy rhodes she and her mother saw this huge triangular 
shaped craft they said as it flew over the freeway they were certain it was metallic and they estimated it was about two miles wide as stacy says the object we saw 
if we opened up a newspaper you could not block out the object that we saw it was gun metal black 
it wasn't shiny it wasn't invisible it was more of a dull bluish black color her daughter emily 
saw it and as emily says we both just stayed there and looked at it for a couple of minutes and it was completely silent around 9 30 p.m a couple in carefree arizona watched this craft 
as it lit up and moved overhead and as the witness says and I quote my feelings at the 
time were only of excitement and not trepidation the ship was not acting in a threatening manner if 
anything it seemed to have an agenda that it wished to execute as efficiently as possible 
but its size its spectacular shape seemed to represent a powerful presence it was hovering 
near the nuclear power plant another witness was tim lay a 54 year old management consultant 
he had just gotten home and was exiting his car when he saw this thing he ran inside and got his 
wife and they both stood outside and watched this object move directly overhead and as he says and I 
quote it was astonishing and a little frightening it was so big and so strange you couldn't actually 
see the object all you could see was the outline as though something was blotting out the stars 
the lights he said were not normal as he says they weren't bulbs they looked like gas there was a 
distortion on the surface also the light didn't spill out or shine I've never seen a light like 
that this was the detail that many other witnesses described another witness was aaron watson 
as she says and I quote I remember looking it was coming over the mountain and it was almost 
as wide as one of the humps and it was very low it was just gliding and then it stopped 
and then the sides retracted a little and it was gone shoo her husband also observed it and he says 
there was no noise the whole time another witness was damian turnage he watched the object pass 
overhead and he says it was actually five lights that were a v one in front and two on each side it 
was a perfect triangle two more witnesses were max and shala sara sen they were driving along 
deer valley road when these lights appeared they pulled over to watch and as max says and I quote 
it was very spooky this gigantic ship blocking out the stars and silently creeping across the sky I 
don't know of any aircraft with silent engines another witness was dr bradley evans a clinical 
psychiatrist he was with his wife chris driving along interstate 10 towards tempe arizona 
and they saw these lights and watched them for 20 minutes as they passed overhead at an altitude he 
estimates of only 1 000 feet another witness was craig johnston he's a retired commercial airline 
pilot he and his 22 year old son were outside their home in scottsdale 
and they were actually outside looking at comet hail bop as were many of the witnesses 
and instead he could hardly believe his eyes when this huge object approached and as he says it was 
the size of 25 airliners moving at about 100 knots at maybe 5 000 feet and it didn't make a sound 
i've flown 747s across oceans and not seen anything like what I saw that night I don't 
expect anybody to take my word for it this was something you had to see for yourself to believe 
he's not the only pilot who saw it as it turns out celebrity and actor kurt russell 
was coming into phoenix at that time and he saw it too he couldn't believe his eyes he actually 
reported it and then forgot about it for some years until he heard about 
the phoenix lights and realized that he was a witness so a lot of really good witnesses 
a few people were actually able to videotape these lights among them were chuck and carla rayden who 
watched the lights pass over their home and pulled out their video camera and according to them 
this video clearly shows unusual lights as chuck rayden says the video doesn't do it justice 
another witness was dana valentine she's a laser printer technician and she observed the 
lights with her father who was an engineer from their phoenix home and they said this object was 
maybe about 500 feet above them as she says we could see the outline of a mass behind the lights 
but you couldn't actually see the mass it was more like a gray distortion of the night sky 
kind of wavy around 10 pm ufo researchers tom king and bill hamilton were in gila bend 
investigating another case of involving a family who had reported seeing lights three days earlier 
and they called and said the ufos were back so tom king and bill hamilton drove over there 
and they actually saw what appears to be the phoenix lights and they captured videotape of it 
bill hamilton counted six orbs of very bright light traveling right in front of the estrella 
mountains and all of the witnesses were absolutely certain that these objects 
were not flares so luke air force base was definitely aware of this and they began receiving 
all kinds of calls from the witnesses we know this because many of the witnesses who called luke 
were told that the air force does not handle ufo reports and they were referred to the national ufo 
reporting center new fork and here's where it gets interesting because the next day 
following this major encounter there was of course a lot of media stories on it 
and luke air force base was being asked all kinds of questions so a luke air force base public 
information officer released an official statement saying that they knew nothing about the sightings 
they had no radar reports they had no airplanes in the sky that night commercial airports 
also reported no unusual radar readings and they said they had received no calls 
well peter davenport heard about this and he revealed that many of the callers he had received 
that night had been to re had been referred to new fork by luke air force base which was in direct 
contradiction to what luke air force base was saying so luke air force base was lying from the 
beginning we know they were aware of it we know they were scrambling air force jets because there 
are numerous witnesses who saw this ufo researcher tom king called luca air force base after the 
event and asked him about this and he was told that no jets had been launched after 7 pm again in 
direct contradiction to the statements of numerous witnesses uh strange universe the ufo program 
did a segment on this and the producer of strange universe his name is artie chamamian he took the 
initiative to call luke air force base directly and was told by a colonel that what the witnesses 
probably saw was a rogue pilot flying with a light rig designed to fool people it's a ludicrous 
debunking explanation so at first luke air force base released this official statement saying there 
were no jets scrambled nothing unusual occurred but later they did admit that they did have 
jets in the sky that night but the jet lights could not account for the alleged sighting 
they also denied dropping any flares or having any knowledge of any flares so there's another 
contradictory statement they're changing their story and still not telling the truth 
it was about two months after the incident two full months that the air national guard 
said that they had sent jets from davis-monthan air force base in tucson south of phoenix to 
conduct training exercises involving flares they said the jets dropped the flares over the berry 
goldwater gunnery test range about 50 miles southwest of phoenix and a spokesman for the 
air national guard lieutenant colonel david tanaka told report reporters those flares that were seen 
could have been our flares so again they were trying to debunk this whole incident 
it's ridiculous this explanation fails to account for the evidence for several reasons what people 
saw did not resemble flares secondly the reports continued before and after the time they were over 
the nearby test range third the lights were not seen over the test range but over phoenix itself 
and outlying areas and phoenix is hardly a location to drop flares for a training exercise 
so months after the incident officials released another statement they were receiving a barrage of 
calls they revealed that they had in fact received a barrage of calls from people about 
the phoenix lights and lieutenant colonel mike houser told the usa today newspaper and I quote 
they're calling us liars I take great exception to that I've answered every question we have nothing 
to hide but the fact is we don't investigate ufos so in my opinion that's a complete lie 
they are hiding everything they know about these phoenix lights because they scrambled jets 
they received a bunch of calls they absolutely knew something very unusual was going on 
in the arizona republic newspaper lieutenant colonel hos hauser was quoted as saying 
we just know it was not one of our planes everybody is telling me that we have ufos 
stashed all over the air force I'm not taking issue with what people saw lots of things can make 
lights dr lynn kitay was actually a witness to these the phoenix lights she saw them 
activity well before the phoenix lights occurred and on that night also saw them she also videotaped she ended up writing a book about this case 
and she spoke with a public information officer at luke air force base who 
admitted that the sighting did in fact take place but that they had nothing to do with it 
he told her and I quote we don't know anything that's the bottom line there was something there 
but what it was that's the question no one knows until someone finds out what they were 
god only knows it definitely wasn't a luke f-16 so dr kitai also spoke with a lieutenant colonel at 
davis-monthan who told her that their unit had been sending off flares for the entire 
week before this incident and as lin kitai says this meant that the flare explanation doesn't fit 
because if the phoenix lights were flares the calls should have been coming in every 
day not just on march 13th so ufo researchers were all over this researcher john greenwald 
submitted a foia request freedom of information act and requested luke air force base to release 
any documents relating to this incident and luke air force base promptly replied that they had no 
response regarding the phoenix lights and that it wasn't them and the story was just 
snowballing but nobody was investigating it at all nobody within government in fact really the only 
government official at all to investigate this incident was city council member frances barwood 
and she fell into it by accident she was on her way to a city council meeting on may 6 and she 
was stopped on the steps by a television crew who asked to speak with her about the phoenix lights 
and they told her that they had been turned away by every level of government and that nobody would talk to them or investigate this and francis barwood said that she didn't know anything about 
these so-called lights but she would make an inquiry and she was surprised to hear this and 
asked the city council manager frank fairbanks whether there was any investigation into this 
and apparently there wasn't so she tried to unite the city council to 
ask luke air force base for answers but the council refused and she continued to press 
the issue and this is when the ridicule began but she didn't give up because immediately after she 
made a statement on this she received a flood of calls from witnesses looking for answers and as 
francis barwood says and I quote there were 37 calls the first day after that it climbed into 
the hundreds I got calls from doctors lawyers celebrities a little league coach called to say 
both teams and their families had seen this most wanted their names kept out of it but they wanted 
answers heck if I'd seen it I'd want answers too one call that really impressed francis 
barwood came from a man who was throwing a hail bop viewing party at his home and he told her 
that he and all 20 of his guests had observed the objects so this really freaked him her out and uh 
she found herself the center of media attention she was both ridiculed for interest in the phoenix lights and was conversely sought after for interviews 
and she realized she had a very sticky situation on her hands she called the mayor's offices and 
the mayor had no statement she called governor fife symington he did not cooperate he had no 
information she called the office of senator john mccain and he also said he knew nothing about it 
she told reporters and I quote it's like a hot potato no one wants to touch this do we have a 
bunch of wimps who are afraid to look into this she began to speculate that the air force was actually covering this up or as she says was it that they knew what it was and they didn't 
want to say in another interview she said it was about this time that some very peculiar 
things regarding the lights and the government's reports concerning them became obvious that I was 
cast as a total flake the reports that bothered me the most and probably solidified my resolve to 
get to the bottom of this were the contradictory reports offered by the phoenix police department 
according to francis barwood a police spokesperson had revealed in a television interview that the 
police station had been overwhelmed with calls on the night of the event however a few days later an 
official memo from this same police department that they received only five calls as francis 
barwood says that inconsistency itself was enough to make him believe that something was amiss 
in january of 1998 she held a press conference and what she said and I quote the issue is not whether 
or not they were flying saucers the issue is why the government has refused to tell the american 
public what exactly these lights were what is just as frustrating if not more so is the fact that the 
information we do get either keeps changing or contradicts what we were told previously 
so despite all this attention francis barwood was eventually voted out of the office of the 
city council and as it turned out as she says and I quote the government never interviewed even one 
witness all I wanted to do was investigate this I never said anything about extraterrestrials 
how could they possibly not know about these craft flying low over major population centers 
that's inconceivable but it's also frightening and francis borrowed she said that she actually talked 
to many high-level military officials who told her and I quote we were afraid to say publicly 
what they saw because they were told it would be the end of their career so as a result of 
all this attention francis barwood decided that she would run for the arizona secretary of state 
and promise to look into the phoenix lights as she says this is a public safety issue of state 
and national significance which should not in good conscience be ignored by a responsible candidate 
we need to get back to what's really important like our constitutional rights and our state rights we have to have someone who's willing to stick her neck out to protect our freedoms 
unfortunately francis barwood was ridiculed and called the ufo candidate uh and uh all she wanted 
to do was get to the bottom of what was happening when she was a city council person she said she 
did receive a call from a gentleman who said he had filmed it and that the footage was outstanding 
uh he said it came very low over his house and he caught really good unmistakable footage and 
he wanted to turn it over to her and she said that she would send someone from her office 
to pick it up however before that could happen she spoke again with this witness who was thanked her 
for sending someone over to pick up the footage and she said what are you talking about I didn't 
send anybody over and the gentleman said that well two gentlemen dressed in suits said that they were 
from your office and retrieved the footage and took it away and she told the gentleman 
i don't have any men who work at my office I only have three women so apparently these are secret 
government agents who took this footage which has never been returned francis borrowed wanted to 
to interview this gentleman but he became ill was rushed to the hospital and apparently passed away 
or she's not sure because he never returned to his home the neighbors do not know what happened 
to him and she was not able to find any other information so yeah she ran for office but did not 
get elected meanwhile the office of uh governor feif symington calls for coming in 
non-stop with people and witnesses asking for answers and at the end of august more than 
five months after the incident governor fife symington held a pref con a press conference 
during which he promised the media that he would assign a special investigator to look into the incident and investigate what people had seen but it was only a few days later that 
governor symington called another press conference saying that he had found the culprit and reporters 
were absolutely stunned when a person wearing an alien costume walked into the room 
governor feif simington said this is who was responsible for the ufo reports 
he was making it a complete joke and boy were people angry uh rights researcher bill burns and 
i quote for those people who believed they'd been witness to a real ufo event and for many others 
who claimed some sort of contact with alien beings either through abduction or previous sightings governor symington's news conference was an insult the news conference if it had been 
an attempt to throw cold water on the rumors of a ufo invasion actually served the opposite purpose 
observers were now more convinced than ever that there was some kind of official cover-up going on 
witnesses were put off by the air force's denials the apparent inability of local governments to 
come up with an explanation and now the deliberate attempt to make fun of the event what was going on 
meanwhile at senator mccain's office there was a lot of pressure to investigate the phoenix lights 
and after being contacted by francis barwood's office senator mccain agreed to contact the air 
force to request an investigation of the incidents but the air force declined saying again that 
they do not investigate ufo reports and senator mccain like francis barwood found himself stymied 
and in a television interview he said I don't know any good answers to it except to say so far 
we have found no evidence of black helicopters or alien invasion or anything of that nature but 
there has been an inability to explain reports that some have made about the presence of lights 
so few other ufo events in history have rocked government like the phoenix lights 
and there are some reports that even the white house was aware of the events according to 
reporters steve wilson of the arizona republic and researcher jim de la teso on the night of 
the phoenix lights the government went on defcon 3 alert and he says that president clinton actually 
disappeared from public view for a period of hours and another weird thing on that same night 
a satellite that was supposed to detect incoming missiles actually malfunctioned and to cap it off 
the magazine scientific american printed a story which stated that strong bursts of gamma radiation 
were detected on march 13 the night of the phoenix lights so while the political leaders in phoenix 
fumbled to deal with this event most of the citizens and researchers who looked into this 
case came away absolutely convinced one of the best researchers on this case is dr lynn kitai and 
her book the phoenix lights and researcher bill hamilton's book the phoenix lights mystery are 
probably the most comprehensive reports of this incredible event this event has of course been 
portrayed in many ufo programs probably the best treatment was in the jonathan fox documentary 
i know what I saw there was another award-winning documentary called the phoenix lights which did an 
excellent job covering this case peter davenport of new fork was of course very impressed by the 
phoenix lights incident he says he's never received as many calls for a single event as 
that one and as he says and I quote the incident over arizona was the most dramatic I've seen 
what we have here is the real thing they are here this case is not closed by any means 
in my judgment the events that took place over arizona remained the most dramatic ufo sighting 
report that I am aware of researcher bill hamilton who observed the lights interviewed witnesses and 
wrote a book on the case says my conclusion right now is that the objects seen on march 
13 were unconventional they were unidentified and they're from an unknown origin I do not 
believe that they are our own advanced technology aircraft of any kind many researchers believe that 
the phoenix lights was not an accidental sighting but was actually showing off to witnesses one of 
them is stephen greer who writes this certainly suggests that the objects indeed wanted to be seen 
one gentleman by the name of ed dames who is well known for being a remote 
viewer basically a government spy caused an uproar when he said the phoenix lights were actually 
lasers powered by humans and the holy event was a hoax most researchers do not agree with this 
and nor do they agree with the flare theory of course but researcher david rapp who is 
a laser specialist for the aerospace industry absolutely disagreed with ed dames and wrote a 
scathing article for the mufon journal in which he explained all the reasons why this laser theory is 
untenable for multiple reasons and again there were videotapes and photographs 
taken some of these were apparently flares uh bruce mcapee did study some of these uh 
video tapes and said that yeah some of these were in fact flares 
he's also believes that many witnesses believe that air force officials were aware of the phoenix 
lights and dropped the flares on purpose to confuse the issue and provide a scapegoat 
but other films appear to show the real thing photographic analyst jim dillateso 
received multiple amateur videotapes taken on that night and he was able to determine that 
there were at least four separate flights over the city lasting for a period of about two hours 
and he says these videotapes show that the lights were uniform they did not vary in intensity or brightness and he is unable to match them with any known aircraft in january of 1999 
peter gersten of the ufo group citizens against ufo secrecy filed a suit against the dod the 
department of defense claiming that the government failed to respond adequate adequately to his foia 
request asking asking for documents related to the phoenix lights a 30-minute hearing was held and 
gersten held up the forms he had received from the department of defense which stated documents found 
but he never got the documents and now the department of defense reversed its position 
completely changed their story and returned a form to peter gersten saying documents not found 
then in march of 2000 judge stephen mcnamee ruled in favor of the department of defense 
and in his decision he stated that this case is not one over the existence or non-existence of 
ufos but whether the government has conducted a reasonable search regarding information 
on specific aerial modes of transportation long story short short 
he cited in favor with the defense the dod and no documents were released and this is when the real 
shocker came it was years after the incident when governor fife symington who had since retired and 
was now a pastry chef revealed that he not only believed the phoenix lights were real 
he was a personal eyewitness and he released a long statement as he says and I quote in 1997
during my second term as governor of arizona I saw something that defied logic and challenged 
my reality I witnessed a massive delta shaped craft silently navigate over [ __ ] peak 
a mountain range in phoenix arizona it was truly breathtaking I was absolutely stunned 
because I was turning to the west looking for the distant phoenix lights and to my astonishment this apparition appeared this dramatically large very distinctive leading edge with some enormous 
lights was traveling through the arizona sky as a pilot and former air force officer 
i can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I'd ever 
seen and it was certainly not high altitude flares because flares don't fly in formation 
this incident was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people in arizona and my office was besieged with phone calls from very concerned arizonians 
the growing hysteria intensified when the story broke nationally I decided to lighten the mood of 
the state by calling a press conference where my chief of staff arrived in an alien costume 
we managed to lessen the sense of panic but at the same time upset many of my constituents 
i would now now like to set the record straight I never meant to ridicule anyone my office did make 
inquiries as to the origins of the craft but to this day they remain unanswered and eventually the 
air force claimed responsibility saying that they dropped flares this is indicative of the attitude 
from official channels we get explanations that fly in the face of facts explanations 
like weather balloons swamp gas and military flares I was never happy with the air force's 
silly explanation there might very well have been military flares in the sky that evening but what I 
and hundreds of others saw had nothing to do with that I now know that I am not alone there are many 
high-ranking military aviation and government officials who share my concern while on active 
duty they have either witnessed a ufo incident or have conducted an official investigation 
into ufo cases relevant to aviation safety and national security by speaking out with me 
these people are putting their reputations on the line they have fought in wars guarded top-secret 
weapons arsenals and protected our nation's skies we want the government to stop putting out stories 
that perpetuate the myth that all ufos can be explained away in down to earth conventional terms 
investigations need to be reopened documents need to be unsealed and the idea of an open 
dialogue can no longer be shunned incidents like these are not going away about a year ago 
chicago's o'hare international airport experienced a ufo event that made national and international 
headlines what I saw in the arizona sky goes beyond conventional explanations when it comes 
to events of this nature that are still completely unsolved we deserve more openness in government 
especially our own I could not agree more and kudos to fife symington for finally 
coming clean so that's the phoenix lights this is perhaps the most famous and widely viewed single 
ufo event since the modern age of ufos began in 1947 and that's why I think it definitely 
deserves the number one spot so there you go that is the top 20 countdown of best cases 
and again it was really hard to come up with this list there were some cases I just really wanted 
to include but there wasn't room I mean there's of course cases involving repeated visits at the yuma 
drive-in really would have liked to talk about those or perhaps the incredible events that are 
going on at the stardust ranch in rainbow valley there's a whole book about that case 
ufo sightings at marana air force base a possible existence of an under ground base in the 
superstition mountains I mean there were a lot of cases that they're just just didn't make the cut 
so it was again yeah really hard to include all of these cases on a top 20 list 
i did cover all these cases and more in my book ufos over arizona a true history 
of ufo encounters of extraterrestrial encounters in the grand canyon state 
which goes into quite a bit more detail on these top 20 cases and of course hundreds of others 
arizona for whatever reason is a major producer of ufo reports and it has really shaped our 
understanding of the ufo phenomena I mean with the phoenix lights being the most famous case perhaps in history the travis walton case is one of the most famous abduction events of all times 
the paradise valley crash is absolutely one of the best verified ufo crash retrieval cases so 
as you can see arizona has played a powerful role in our understanding of the ufo phenomenon 
that's why I wanted to do this episode presenting the top 20 cases I hope you've enjoyed it I 
really appreciate you watching thank you very much and that's it for now so until next time 
keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most importantly keep having fun
