ALIENS' SYMBOLS ON THE SKIN
Sep 24, 2021

Summary:
Sep 24, 2021
When somebody has a close encounter and are taken onboard a UFO, it is not unusual for them to return with strange markings on their body. Often this may take the form of a scoop mark, bruises, or puncture marks. Much more rare are weird alien symbols. And yet, over and over again, people who meet extraterrestrials and have an onboard encounter are left with an unexplained alien symbol somewhere on their body. 

These symbols can be simple, such as the shape of a triangle, or more complex, such as foreign-looking letters, hieroglyphic-like designs, or weird symbolic patterns of obviously intelligent design.

This video presents several cases of abductees and experiencers who have returned from their encounters bearing these alien symbols on their skin. One of the cases presented here is among the strangest on record. There are now enough cases now to make it clear that something very profound is happening here. 

What do these symbols mean? Are they the result of an extraterrestrial medical procedure? Could this be a symptom of an alien implant? Are ETs tagging humans like we do to animals? Are they tattooing people with an alien symbol for tracking purposes? Are they calling cards, proof for the witness that something unusual has happened to them?

These are questions which hopefully some of these cases will be able to answer!

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to another episode of UFOs in 
the Paranormal. Today's episode is an unusual one I call it, "Alien Symbols on the Skin".
I'm not talking about scoop marks here or bruises. There are many cases like that. What I'm talking 
about is something much more unusual. These are cases in which people who have had a very close 
encounter are left with a weird alien symbol on their skin. These cases are actually quite unusual 
and yet there are enough I think that it bears looking into. There's not a lot known about these. 
Their purpose remains unknown but it's definitely a consistent feature of a UFO encounter. 
Now, alien symbols are nothing new. They've certainly appeared on a number of UFO craft. 
We also see alien insignias on alien jumpsuits and things like this, but sometimes in very rare 
cases these weird symbols are left on people's skin. And that's what I want to talk about today. 

The first case I'd like to talk about is case one, Jose Viewest. This case occurred 
on August 23rd, 1975. When Jose and her friend saw eight UFOs outside their home in 
San Diego, California. This was how it all began for Jose. It was just a few weeks later that a 
very strange incident happened which she thinks is probably related to all this. She was approached 
by a complete stranger on the street. Who walked up to her and said that she knew Jose very well. 
Jose did not know this person. However, she was struck by this person's peculiar appearance. This 
was a lady she said who had very white long hair, strange eyes and very very smooth skin. 
It was a brief encounter but very curious and she doesn't know if it's related or not to 
this UFO experience. But she thinks it might be because it wasn't long after that before 
more strange experiences happened. 

In 1980 Jose whose husband works in the military. They moved to Hawaii because that's where her husband had been stationed for his military duty. And in July of 1980 Jose was upstairs looking out the window when she saw this red 
glowing UFO and as soon as she saw it she started to feel really faint. She called her 
husband, he came running up and the UFO took off. But it was exactly one week later when Jose woke 
up and found herself on board a UFOI. She was in a small room lying on what looked like a metallic 
table and there were these figures standing around her which were bald and had slits for eyes. 

And this is how her experiences began. Following this she was abducted a few more times. 
On one occasion the ET's brought her on board and showed her a map which showed 
all the military installations across the United States. They had several questions 
for her. They asked her why the U.S government was letting people go hungry. They also wanted 
to know why there was so much pollution which they indicated was destroying our own race 
and they told her that they are simply there to observe. It was a couple of years later, in 1982 
Jose and her husband were back in San Diego. Jose was on the couch in the living room 
when she suddenly fell asleep and woke up sometime later. She felt that her arm was hurting pretty bad 
and she looked on her arm and there was this weird symbol, fairly large covering a good portion of her 
arm and it was quite painful. So they actually went to the doctor and the doctors were very concerned 
because x-rays showed that there was what appeared to be a metallic disc in this area where the 
alien symbol was. So, maybe this was a result of an implant operation. Hard to say but the mark is 
still on Jose's arm and she has no idea what it means. The aliens did not tell her but sometimes 
they do. 

As in this next case. Case two that I want to talk about I call Antonio Carlos Ferreira. This case is 
actually covered in the book, "UFO Abduction at Mirasol" by Walter Buehler. This is a very interesting 
abduction case which occurred on June 28, 1979. In Mirasol, Brazil the main witness was a night watchman. 
And on June 28, 1978 he looked up and saw this glowing red light in the sky. It got lower and lower, 
started zigzagging and suddenly it came and landed on the ground near him. Two beings dressed in shiny 
silver suits came out and approached him. They dragged him on board the craft. Antonio Carlos had his dog 
with him. A guard dog. The dog tried to attack the beings and the beings aimed a little sort of light at 
the dog which rendered the dog unconscious. Antonio Carlos was brought on board and the next thing he 
remembers he's being let go. So, he had missing time. He didn't have any real memory of what happened on board but 
what's interesting about this case is there was considerable physical evidence the area where 
this UFO had landed was swept clean of debris there was also some burn marks on nearby trees 
magnetic readings were taken and metal objects within this area had varying degrees of magnetism 
depending on how close they were to the actual landing site jose antonio's clothes were ripped and stained and most interesting he had this weird mark on his arm 
he ended up going under hypnosis and under hypnosis he recalled an abduction scenario 
very much like the original abduction that was first publicized ever by antonio villa boas 
like antonio villabos antonio ferreira remembered being pulled on board and he was 
physically examined his clothes were removed ET's covered his body in this weird oil substance 
and he was seduced by a female e.t and they indicated that they were trying to reproduce and 
make a child this is of course a pretty common feature in onboard UFO accounts 
so jose's case certainly matches in that detail but another very strange thing happened right 
before they released antonio they told him they would see him again and they began to mark his arm 
with a needle-like instrument uh and it was this very large mark which was essentially a cross 
with a circle around it and they told antonio ferreira that this was 
their mark and that they would see him again and sure enough they did i'm following this 
antonio carlos you know had a series of abductions at least 10 of them and on each case 
they would mark him with this peculiar mark so this happened so many times that antonio's body 
soon became almost covered by these strange marks as investigators reported we observed 
and photographed similar marks on his body in the left chest region we found two more of these cross 
marks on his trunk and abdomen and they soon found evidence of more marks each of these marks took 
about four months to heal but these abductions were so frequent that antonio pretty much 
always had one of these symbols on his body and uh again the aliens told him that this was their 
emblem so I don't know what's going on here antonio did show evidence of having a disc like 
implant beneath one of these uh body marks very much like described by jose 
buist so again maybe that's what's going on here or maybe this is more akin to a tattoo 
it's certainly not unique another very interesting case took place in colorado springs colorado to a 
CASE THREE "NOAH"
man by the name of noah that's a pseudonym I did cover this case in my book UFOs over colorado this 
particular incident took place on july 5th 2011 and noah had a very strange experience 
it's important to note here that noah is a c6 quadriplegic bound to his wheelchair in his home 
in colorado springs and one morning he woke up to notice this weird hieroglyphic like symbol on his 
right hip it was physically hot to the touch and it appeared almost as if it was branded into his 
skin and over the next three weeks it scabbed over and slowly began to heal was a very strange symbol 
he described it as having one vertical line on the left side three horizontal stacked lines in the 
center three dots in a vertical line on the right and a stray marking below it and as noah says in 
his own words at first my aide mentioned it and I figured it was nothing until I saw it in a mirror 
it was shockingly unnatural and I felt a deep conviction it was made by intelligent design he 
had no idea how this mark appeared or even why but then suddenly and spontaneously a short time later 
he remembered as he says all of a sudden in the shower it hit me 
a dream from the previous night I remember being in a bright room or area feeling very 
calm and not scared this was induced and I was artificially numb to what I was encountering 
an entity proceeded to ask me questions about my spinal cord injury I was asked specifically 
about my hands and fingers and arms why were they as such what was done to try and fix me 
why was one side stronger I answered without hesitation what happened next noah says remains 
totally unexplained as he says in his own words I was very psychologically level then I felt pain 
looked at my right hand all my fingers were straight and spread this isn't 
possible without lengthy splinting next my left hand and fingers did the same thing 
this hurt but it was good to see all the same the entities seem to not understand why I remained 
paralyzed and that I got the impression they were surprised upset and confused as to what I can 
only guess they perceived to be primitive medical technology this is all I remember from the dream 
but had I not seen the mark on my skin I would never have recalled anything 
so perhaps that's what's going on here perhaps these marks are being left purposefully by the 
et's for the benefit of the experiencer to give them perhaps proof that this experience happened 
or to give them a way to prompt this memory and have the memories come back 
consciously hard to say but there are other cases like this another case comes from
CASE FOUR SARA SHAW
ann druffle and d scott rogo in their book the tahunga kenyan contacts I call this case four 
sarah shaw this case occurred on march 22 1953 in tahunga canyon california and this is now a very 
well known abduction case involving two young women sarah shaw and jan whitley 
who experienced missing time in a remote cabin in tahanga canyon
at the time they had no real recall other than this bright light flooding the cabin and a period 
of missing time however following this incident sarah shaw's life changed drastically she ended up 
quitting her job and she moved into the medical field and became really obsessed with medicine 
and learning about the human body this could be significant but it was some 22 years later that 
sarah shaw met with ann druffle d scott rogo and other researchers and ultimately she ended going 
under hypnosis to recall what happened during this missing time and under hypnosis she recalled 
that she and jan whitley were both pulled on board to a craft which had landed near their home 
on board they were undressed and subjected to a physical examination 
and it was a fairly brief encounter the ets did seem particularly interested in a surgical scar 
on sarah's body where she had had lung surgery and they also put this weird mark on her body and 
sarah described this as looking very much like the number four as sarah says in her own words 
you know what they're doing they're like numbering putting a number or something on my back 
invisibly I mean they're putting an invisible number it's a mark it looks like the number four 
according to sarah as she says it comes to a point with a little mark
like an oriental looking line all I can think of is when they mark animals a herd of animals to 
keep track a tattoo or something like an invisible tattoo except you don't feel it you don't feel 
it somehow it's kind of like whatever it was they put to tranquilize things something on me 
and it was the same on my back it's under my skin almost into the skin like an invisible tattoo
further questioning revealed that the aliens told sarah that they had put this mark on her body 
to keep track of her through her various incarnations and so apparently they're 
following her through various lifetimes and she was told she was one of them so 
there's another possible reason for these weird markings probably the most 
common marking people talk about is a simple triangle and there are many many cases like this 
i covered one in my book onboard UFO encounters it occurred to a gentleman by the name of kim kammen 
CASE FIVE KIM KAMMANN
i've covered kim's case before in another one of my videos so i'll just briefly go through this one 
in 1994 when kim was 39 years old he was in his home in bourbonet illinois when he woke up and 
saw greys surrounding his bed by the way kim was a mechanic for the special forces in the army 
and recently retired but these grays surrounded his bed and said telepathically get up and come 
with us we're not going to hurt you just relax it's okay and as kim says I was in somewhat of a 
shock kind of amazed or odd all I know is I got up and walked out I really wasn't scared I don't know 
how to describe it it wasn't like I had control of myself they said come with us and I did it wasn't 
like I really had much of a choice he walked out into the living room and saw the living room wall 
was gone he walked out into the backyard and saw a huge craft hovering very low overhead 
it had colored lights red green blue and yellow he said it was really beautiful actually he was hit 
by a beam of light and the next thing he knows he's inside this craft and as he says it was a 
circular round room all I can remember is being on this steel or concrete like slab like an autopsy 
table i've never been in an autopsy room but it kind of looked like that it was a plain room next 
thing he knows he saw this instrument coming down from the ceiling looked like sort of a power tool 
and uh that's all he remembers next thing he knows he's waking up the next morning and there 
is this triangular mark on the inside of his forearm it's about three inches below the elbow 
it's red and indented into his skin so he immediately went to the veterans administration 
hospital and saw an army psychiatrist who told him that no this does not appear to be psychosomatic 
and you can either deny this experience or accept it happened and moved on
and he decided to just accept it and move on some years later he was watching tv with his wife when 
he got incredible confirmation of this weird mark it was this UFO show and there was another 
abductee on the show who apparently had the same triangular mark and as kim cannon says they showed 
the triangle I thought it was going to crap in my pants at that moment it was like ice went down my 
back looking at that I was like oh my god and my wife just looked at me and said hey that's 
the same mark you have on your arm isn't it and yet it was the same mark that I had on my arm 
i always thought there were extraterrestrials out there but when it happened to me I am convinced 
i am very solidly convinced of it now it was a little scary but I wouldn't call it an unpleasant 
experience if I had to go through it again I probably would because they didn't hurt me I don't 
know what they did if they put an implant in me or not I can't say I was forced into doing anything 
no anal probes but I know they put that mark on my arm and it was a pretty good sized mark
so yeah these triangular marks are fairly common I mean I could march out a dozen cases of those 
at least i'll just talk about maybe two more one involves the very well-known experiencer whitley 
strieber he's apparently had this experience more than once as he says in his own words I have had 
CASE SIX WHITLEY STRIEBER
triangles etched on my arm and what happened more than once whitley really began to search 
for the reason I mean was there meaning behind this was it an attempt at he's not sure as he says I began to think of triangles of triads of the struggle I have had 
to find a linear balance within myself the fundamental idea of the triad as a creative 
energy that is two opposite forces coming into balance to create a third force the 
imprinting of triangles on myself may also have a similar significance or as he says 
could it have been a communication even a request for a response of some sort 
so he has really looked into this idea extensively that this is some weird symbolic meaning 
as whitley strieber says again in his own words it could be that the triangle performs a similar 
symbolic function wherever the three-dimensional universe prevails and speaking to us through that 
particular form if that is what they are doing the visitors may be announcing themselves as 
belonging to the same laws that inscribe our being and identifying their presence with the 
everlasting ideology of transformation it could be a symbol not only of mute 
mutuality of structure but of shared aim which is the continuation of life in the search for wisdom
so yeah I enjoy whitley's case because he's really looked deeply at the possible philosophical 
meaning to these weird triangular marks or other marks for that matter I have had another case 
which I researched briefly involving a young woman who experienced a UFO sighting and missing time 
CASE SEVEN ANONYMOUS
at topanga beach california right on the coastline there and uh as she says or actually as one of the 
witnesses involved in this says my daughter knew somebody at her school who said she was out in 
malibu down near the beach and this UFO hovered near and then they got the real strong impression 
that they were supposed to leave this location so they got out of the water and left and she 
said that she had this little triangle on her arm afterwards so yeah the triangles are quite common 
but the case I really wanted to talk about and the real reason why I did this video is 
the eighth case i'd like to talk about which involved a lady by the name of linda I won't use 
CASE EIGHT LINDA
her last name but that is her real name and she is a therapist and a very interesting lady who I met 
at a burbank mufon meeting and she had a really remarkable experience with alien symbols 
it probably began early in childhood but at this point linda was not aware of it her first real 
conscious memory of anything having to do with UFOs occurred when she was an adult in june of 
1980 when she was driving along the pacific coast highway through santa monica with her friend 
and they looked out on the water and saw this glowing object floating on the water and 
linda was perplexed because it didn't look like a normal boat and as she says in her own words 
i couldn't figure out what this could be and I said to the guy with me what do you suppose that is and he turned around and looked at it 
and he saw it for only a second when it just shot straight up in the air and blinked out 
it didn't look like it went far enough to disappear from view like from a distance it just sort of stopped it stopped being there so that was her first really conscious 
ufo sighting but this sort of began a very interesting series of events as a young girl 
linda suffered from some pretty severe child abuse and as a result was going through therapy and very 
successfully and in fact it was so successful that's why she became a therapist herself and her 
therapist at some point recommended that linda see a massage therapist and that this would help her
resolve some issues with her child abuse and this was in 1983 when linda was seeing a massage therapist and this is when weird symbols 
began to appear on her body and these were not simple symbols these were very complex obviously 
meaningful marks and as linda says in her own words this was the type of deep tissue massage 
and very strange things started to come up and I didn't know what they were there were a lot 
of symbols I would be taking a shower and I would look down on my leg and I would have one of those 
symbols on my legs there were one or two it looked exactly like I had scratched the design on 
but I had no recall of doing it I was just taking a shower and it happened repeatedly 
so these weird symbols kept appearing over a period of months and linda started to write 
them down in a little notebook because they were so obviously meaningful and she marveled at how 
precise they were and what could possibly be causing them because she knew it wasn't 
her doing it and this began a journey where she really tried to find the meaning of these symbols 
and she just wasn't having much luck as linda says I kept taking them to people and saying 
have you ever seen these before do you know what they mean nobody knew I took them to healers at 
the human light center to psychics I went to books on symbolism and to the messianic temple 
and all sorts of things and nobody knew what these were they hadn't seen them before and 
after a while I finally gave up on it I just gave up because nobody knew what these were
and linda put her little notebook away and tried to forget it and at some point these symbols 
stopped appearing and she thought that would be the end of it but it wasn't she did finally 
get the answer or n answer to what these symbols were in a very unexpected and synchronistic way 
linda and her boyfriend decided that they were going to watch this television miniseries called intruders this is based on bud hopkins book intruders and is of course 
about people who are being taken on board and having experiences and interactions 
with mostly gray type extraterrestrials and it was during the airing of this television 
miniseries that linda got the answer to the question that she had been seeking for so 
so long there was a scene in intruders where people were taken on board and shown symbols on 
the wall and linda recognized these alien symbols instantly as linda says my boyfriend and I just 
sat there and glared at each other because those were the symbols I had been drawing I saw them on 
that show and these are the things that had been surfacing in 1983 which nobody could identify 
and since I had recorded the television program I backed it up and freeze framed it and did drawings 
off the screen of the symbols they were showing and then I got out my drawings and there are a 
number of them that are the same and then I looked at them and I said what the hell does that mean
what's very interesting about this particular case is those symbols that were on the television 
miniseries intruders are taken from real life cases those are actual alien symbols portrayed on 
that television miniseries but hopkins wanted this these to be accurate 
and uh this really blew linda's mind and she thought why the heck are alien symbols appearing 
on my body and it wasn't long after that before she started to have a series of weird dreams and 
this is when she realized that she was probably a contactee and had been for a very long time 
because most of these dreams were dreams about her encountering UFOs and aliens at a very young age 
the first stream linda was five years old she was in the front yard next to the swing set 
when a UFO appeared and began ejecting smaller probe-like objects and that's all she remembered 
but it was in the same time period that she began having another dream reflecting the 
same time period and in the second dream she was standing in a wheat field next to her home when 
something very strange happened there was this UFO and a human looking e.t standing next to her 
and this UFO was shining down a beam of light on the field which had a very very strange effect 
as linda says I was in the wheat field and someone was standing behind me and 
they kept repeating over and over again not to move and if I moved something would go wrong 
and I was being shown going backwards in time everything that had happened on that spot 
where that wheat field was what the different land formations had looked like and everything 
i guess it was like virtual reality because I could actually feel the temperature and the wind 
and smell things and they kept reminding me don't move because some of this stuff was so beautiful 
I wanted to go running off into it and they kept saying don't move stay still 
so this is very much like hg wells and the time machine wherever this beam was 
linda was watching this area of land go back in time going through the seasons 
back through the years it was very very strange and the third dream was even more dramatic 
Linda recalled that she was outside of her home again as a young girl and her mother was with her 
and there was a UFO landed next to the house and it was shining a very bright beam of light 
on the whole house and linda's mother ordered linda to go into the house 
and linda in the dream told her mother no I don't want to walk through the time beam again so 
that's very interesting i've never heard anyone describe a beam of light from a UFO as a time 
beam but in the dream linda did go back into the house and inside she saw what she believes 
are probably human-looking extraterrestrials and as linda says in her own words there were these 
blonde people they were all blonde they weren't completely solid they were somewhat translucent 
and they were showing me things back in time and they were asking me to do something and I kept saying that I don't really trust people I can see through 
so those were the series of dreams which are very unusual but really cemented in linda's mind that 
she was probably in touch with extraterrestrials it was just a few years later she was with her 
boyfriend in malibu at an outdoor concert when they both looked up and saw a metallic craft 
totally silent below the canyon walls moving through the canyon it was a very brief sighting 
but both of them were absolutely convinced it was a UFO and that's pretty much the end of 
her UFO experiences as far as she's consciously aware of I should note that linda is profoundly 
psychic has had a lot of precognition and other weird paranormal experiences
on one occasion she looked up and saw a street light ahead of her and she just knew it was 
going to go out and sure enough right after she looked at it it went out followed by all the 
other street lights on that street she also had more weird dreams uh one dream that she recalled 
was being a young girl again and being levitated out of her bed and pulled through the closed 
window and up into the sky so yeah it's pretty clear to linda that she is probably a contactee 
so that's pretty much the extent of linda's experiences she has no desire to go under hypnosis 
or anything like that she's happy to leave things where they are but it's a very interesting case to 
say the least I covered linda's case in my book wondrous 25 true UFO encounters and Linda's case 
is probably the ultimate case i've ever heard of of weird alien symbols on a person's skin 
and we still don't know what these symbols mean this could be the result of a medical procedure 
perhaps they are putting in implants or perhaps this is more of a calling card 
sort of uh alien tattoo to let the witness know that they have had an experience 
or for the et's to allow them to track people or to mark a person in some way it's very hard to say 
but what is interesting is these marks are
not common but certainly have turned up in many many cases and often they're quite similar involving the sort of round circle with a weird design in the 
center so I don't know I don't know what these mean that's one of the reasons I wanted to do 
this video to explore this mystery further and maybe someday we can figure it out but until 
then it remains a mystery well that's it for now I hope you've enjoyed this episode I want 
to thank you once again for watching. I truly appreciate it, and until next time keep having fun.
