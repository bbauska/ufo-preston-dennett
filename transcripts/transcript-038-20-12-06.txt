UFOS AND SPIRITUALITY: SEVEN STRANGE CASES
Dec 6, 2020

Summary:
Dec 6, 2020
UFOs are not just a nuts and bolts phenomenon. There is also a strong spiritual aspect to 
extraterrestrial encounters. In fact, a wide variety of paranormal events surround UFOs. A 
close encounter often has a huge impact on a person, challenging them on multiple levels, 
physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It's very clear that UFOs have a powerful 
connection to human consciousness and spirituality. 

This video presents seven firsthand UFO cases in which spirituality played a profound role. 
Spirit quests, meditation, ghostly visitations, dreams, premonitions, OBEs, channeling, 
psychic healing...all of these are part of the UFO phenomenon. Over and over again, people 
who have close encounters find themselves spiritually transformed.

What exactly is the connection between UFOs and the paranormal? While the answers remain 
elusive, these cases show that this connection manifests in a wide variety of ways.

The man who climbs a mountain to overcome an internal struggle is greeted by a UFO. A lady 
tired of the world retreats to the wilderness to find herself instead confronted with 
something otherworldly. Two young ladies struggle with an angry poltergeist only to find 
that something else even more bizarre has also arrived for a visit. These and other astounding 
cases will show you how truly strange the UFO experience can be.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  the title of today's presentation is ufos and  
spirituality ufos is not just a nuts and bolts  phenomenon there's a wide variety of paranormal  
events that surround it and it definitely seems  to be connected very deeply to human consciousness  
and spirituality so i thought i would  present seven cases that sort of showcase uh  
this connection in the various forms it can  take the first case i'd like to talk about  
i call ufos over mount san gorgonio the  main witness in this case is mark grant  
he was a friend of my sisters i interviewed him  about his incredible ufo experiences which really  
began in 1982. he was with his girlfriend i'll  call her rachel that's not her name they decided  
that they were just going to go hang out and look  at the stars overlooking the san fernando valley  
here in california they drove out onto mulholland  drive in topanga canyon and it overlooks the san  
fernando valley which is just this beautiful view  of city lights and as they were sitting there on  
the hood of their car just talking suddenly they  see this object approach it's just there it's a  
triangular formation of white lights and i can't  quite tell how close it is but it's not far away  
there's no sound it's just hanging there in  space hovering and they get the feeling it's  
looking at them and they're wondering what  the heck could this be are there helicopters   why is there no sound when suddenly these darn  things swoop towards them and seem to swoop away  
at the same time they also changed colors this  was a little bit of a disorienting uh event for  
them and i'll just quote mark directly as to what  he experienced this is mark talking as he says  
we were talking about it looking at these lights  and we thought maybe they were helicopters   or something like that then they started coming  towards us they split off in all three directions  
the one on the top looked like it was going up  and away and towards us all at the same time  
and the two at the bottom looked like they  went straight at us around our periphery   and at the same time they looked like they  were going away too they kind of disappeared
so again there was this was very disorienting  for them they were actually a little shaken   up and scared they didn't talk about it they just  got in the car and drove off looking back i think  
they may have had missing time because of the  way they described this object coming at them  
and going away at the same time and the strong  fear reaction that they had from it and the fact  
that they never talked about it all of these are  sort of little red flags at any rate he did dream  
about it once or twice but that seemed to be the  end of it around this time he had successfully  
overcome alcohol and drug addiction and had  joined a group along with his friend rachel  
called the wilderness challenge which sort of  celebrates having overcome their addictions  
by doing a mountain climb and they  decided that they were going to climb  
mount san gorgonio which is here in southern  california it's a very tall mountain it's 11  
200 feet high but there is a pathway up it's sort  of a walk up the mountain but still very difficult  
mark and his friends went up there it took them  three days actually to get to the top and finally  
they reached the peak of mount san gorgonio they  got to hold the little wooden sign that everyone  
gets to hold showing the elevation when they got  to the top and it was just a great fun climb and  
a really great way to celebrate they're having  overcome addiction sort of like a spiritual quest  
and no sooner had they got there and  reached the peak set up their tents   lit a campfire and so on when suddenly  something very strange happened this very large  
very bright object showed up it was at  least twice the size of the full moon  
mark says and extremely bright and totally  silent as mark says it hovered and circled  
around it was about 300 to 400 feet above us it  was very close the whole area around us lit up  
it was very uncomfortable to look into the light  because it was so bright so intense it was very  
apparent to everybody that there was something  there the problem is no one could figure out  
what it was there was some speculation that  it might be a helicopter but it was very close  
there was no sound and this is pretty high for  a helicopter i mean they can reach this height  
uh but it was pretty apparent to everybody that  this was not a helicopter because of the sound  
and the way this thing was moving  hovering and sort of circling around them   and it was very strange very peculiar and again  too bright to look at and finally this thing  
doesn't really move away as far as they can  tell it sort of just shrank into a tiny little  
dot and disappeared or perhaps moved away  very quickly and just had that appearance  
but at any rate whatever happened here  does seem to be connected to their having  
gone on this sort of spiritual quest and climbed  to the top of this mountain mountaintops are  
considered holy spots sacred areas uh in many  cultures so perhaps that's related to this  
at any rate it's a very strange place to see  a ufo in a very strange time i think there  
is a connection because there are a lot of cases  like this and let's just talk about another this  
next case i like i'd like to talk about i call  the musical ufo this case occurred in late 1984  
outside of the town of santa fe new mexico it's  a beautiful little town a very spiritual place  
actually and that's why tammy had gone there the  main witness is tammy that's not her real name  
she decided to just disconnect from the  world and go on a sort of spiritual retreat  
and she ended up renting this  little cabin with a friend of hers   out in the sort of wilderness outside of santa  fe new mexico this was a pretty remote cabin  
it had no electricity no running water just  a road little dirt road leading up to it  
and uh they had been there only a few weeks when  a very strange incident happened they were both  
just sort of in their own room and uh there was  this very bright flash of light outside it was  
persistent and at the time it started flashing  there was this very strange musical sound  
it was very sort of lyrical but also computer-like  i'll just let tammy describe it in her own words  
and she says it was a very distinctive sound  which was cheerful very computer-like in  
terms of it sounding like the noises that you  make when you push a phone or calculator even  
though it felt kind of automated it was very  lyrical and very pretty and a very happy sound  
so they came running out of their rooms looked  outside but but by this point it was gone they   talked about it they both heard it they both saw  it uh they had no idea what it could be tammy's  
friend was pretty skeptical of anything paranormal  and thought well perhaps you know someone was  
outside with a flashlight or a car had driven up  though it was clear to both of them that this was  
not the case because it was a very isolated  area there was no one else around for miles  
and it was a one-way road uh so they didn't  know what it was tammy thought it was something  
spiritual something connected to the fact they  were out here in the wilderness and sort of  
steeped in nurturing themselves so a few months go  by tammy's roommate decides she's going to leave  
and tammy is now alone in the cabin and she's  becoming even more steeped in nurturing herself  
and cooking and this sort of thing just being  very spiritual and she was in her room one evening  
she was sitting in bed she had been  reading and decided she was going to be   going to go to sleep had just set down the book  and was beginning to fall asleep when she suddenly  
heard the same music the same lyrical noise  and as soon as she heard it she uh sort of sat  
up and thought you know she woke up and sat up  and says all right guys out loud i know you're  
back i know you're back here what do you want and  this is when something really incredible happened  
this light came swooping down out of the sky it  looked like this sort of ball of light a sphere  
and it appeared to be about the  size of a basketball she said and   it came swooping down towards the cabin she  was facing a very large picture window so  
she could see this thing outside as it comes  swooping down straight for her straight for the  
window actually comes into the window and strikes  her with what appears to be a beam of light  
or just comes in completely all the way the music  is still playing her whole body begins vibrating  
it gets very scary and uh as she says and  i'm quoting it was a very intense fast-moving  
bright white light and it came rushing towards the  window and then came into the window and sort of  
jammed me in the solar plexus so as this is  happening she's paralyzed she can't move her  
entire body is vibrating like crazy this  music is still playing and she starts  
getting a little bit frightened because she  felt like something else was controlling her  
and she says the moment she became frightened it  all just kind of stopped and evaporated she didn't  
see it really move away it rather just sort of  disappeared and afterwards she actually felt great  
she felt completely spiritually rejuvenated  and sort of transformed is how she put it  
just zinging with energy she hadn't felt that  good in a very very long time and she feels  
very strongly that this was definitely connected  to the fact that she was sort of on a spiritual  
quest she's not sure if this was a ufo in terms of  uh you know a craft with ets or that sort of thing  
but she definitely considers this is a distinct  possibility and at any rate she feels this was  
definitely a result of her sort of spiritual  meditation as she says and again i'm quoting  
i'll tell you how i think of of it how i remember  it i don't know if the events are really related  
but i always thought that the atmosphere and  the environment and the mood that i was in  
had some sort of effect on it or influenced the  event i was all holed up there and i was just  
reading and writing and making handmade clothes  and really pampering myself and being creative in  
solitary i had unplugged the phone and everything  so again here we see this pattern of ufos  
appearing after a long spiritual quest and  there's many different forms this sort of  
spirituality and ufos can take another case  i'd like to talk about i call the poltergeist  
and the ufo this is a very strange case  it occurred in 1988 in van nuys california  
again i interviewed the people directly one of the  witnesses i call trudy that's not her real name  
she moved into an apartment in van nuys  a little apartment apartment number 15  
because it was cheap it was only  600 dollars and she could afford it   just barely and almost immediately started having  weird problems with a knocking noise on the wall  
it was always three knocks and she thought it  was perhaps her neighbor throwing a tennis ball  
against the wall that they shared and at some  point it stopped and she thought her neighbor  
moved out and she talked to her manager  the apartment manager about it and the   manager said no actually the neighbor moved  out because of the noise he thought it was  
you so trudy thought that was kind of  strange at any rate at this time she was  
she worked as a in telephone sales but was also  doing a play she was an aspiring actress and she  
met a friend at the play who was also in the  play by the name of karen who was looking for an  
apartment and trudy offered to share her apartment  with karen because she was having trouble meeting  
expenses so karen moves in it's just a one-bedroom  apartment but she's got a big old king-sized bed  
so they decided they're just going to share the  bed they became really good friends and it wasn't  
long after karen moved in that karen started to  see strange shadow-like uh figures darting down  
the hallway and she didn't want to say anything  to trudy because trudy hadn't sent anything  
they invited a friend over to set up their stereo  and the friend suddenly jumped up and looked  
towards the hallway and says oh you have lemurs  in your house and they both turn into lemurs what  
do you mean he said they're kind of spiritual  big-eyed creatures that i see and now they're  
only present when ghosts are around but you know  never mind um and he didn't want to talk about it  
he became very nervous and uh set up the stereo  very quickly politely excused himself and left  
so that kind of spooked both uh trudy and karen  and they began to wonder if strange things were  
happening because other weird things started to  happen they started to see these shadowy figures  
again one time they were both had gone to bed and  were just getting ready to turn out the lights  
when suddenly they both saw this shadowy figure  peer around the corner and look at them it was  
clearly a sort of apparition of a woman and they  both jumped up and uh they said did you see that  
and like yeah i saw that and that's when it really  began kicking in uh in earnest this terrible  
haunting this was not your average haunting it  was very intense what started with apparitions uh  
moved into a wide variety of phenomena they began  having strange noises like pots and pans clanging  
in the kitchen the cabinets would sometimes be  opened when they woke up in the morning objects  
started moving around in the apartment their  bike you know the remote control things else  
anything would just move around and all kinds  of weird phenomena light bulbs started exploding  
there was a weird cold spot in the hallway the  apparitions were getting more and more bold  
sometimes they would just zoom up right towards  them especially if they were having any kind   of disagreement which they started to have  because this was becoming to be a very scary  
situation they tried doing very various rituals  to get rid of the ghosts and nothing seemed to  
work these apparitions were getting more and  more bold uh one time they were laying in bed  
when the bed started shaking and this started to  become a nightly occurrence um so they were losing  
sleep at this point and at their wits end they  didn't know what to do they tried lighting candles  
they tried doing chants they tried uh pouring  salt around the apartment anything to stop this  
they asked the building manager about it and the  building manager said yes there has been a problem   with ghosts she herself had sensed a presence  and they've had people move out because of this  
they talked to their neighbor across the hall and  the neighbor freaked out because she said yeah she   was having all kinds of paranormal phenomena  somebody was tugging at her hair she felt a  
presence and weird things like this so apparently  this whole building was haunted it turned out it  
was a retirement building there were ambulances  coming and going all the time because people were   sick and passing away as well she learned that  someone had passed away in her apartment someone  
had passed away an apartment below them so they  were becoming increasingly frightened and were   having sort of this spiritual battle and finally  it reached the sort of ultimate point i mean they  
couldn't invite friends over because the friends  would see ghosts and go running run away screaming  
and they couldn't move out because they couldn't  afford it and they were losing sleep because their  
bed kept shaking and one evening it was really  bad the bed was shaking and these apparitions  
were zooming at them and uh trudy had had it she  crawled up on the bed got into a kneeling position  
and was praying and saying the lord's prayer and  asking god to you know move these spirits away  
and at this point one of the spirits came  and attacked her it pinned her down to  
the bed she couldn't move and it moved  inside of her and tried to possess her  
she could see it very clearly now it was a  woman with this weird kind of sickly sweet  
toothy smile very stringy hair dark eyes it scared  her very badly she said it was physically painful  
she was unable to move she was paralyzed she  couldn't breathe the pressure was extremely  
intense uh karen who watched all this happen she  saw the apparition come up and attack her and hold  
uh trudy down and uh finally it  ended this spirit moved out of her  
trudy took a big breath and they were able  to breathe again they're like that's it   we're moving out when morning came they spent the  entire day getting boxes and packing up all their  
stuff and finding a new place to live at the end  of that day they decided they were going to go out  
and uh get something to eat at cafe 50s which  was just down the street on van nuys boulevard  
and they got into the restaurant got a table and  had ordered their meal and suddenly the table  
started shaking at first they each thought  it was the other person shaking the table  
but then they realized no this table was shaking  by itself and it really freaked them out they  
called the waiter over who thought they were crazy  and they quickly and nervously ate their meal  
and as they were paying at the counter suddenly  the little gumball stand which was just a  
freestanding gumball machine starts shaking back  and forth the guy at the counter looks at it and  
turns pale white so do they they know exactly  what's going on it's this darn poltergeist it's  
followed them to the restaurant and so that was  again enough to send them running away from cafe  
50s they leave the restaurant and get into their  uh their car they're too afraid to go into their  
apartment so they stayed a hotel that night and  they move out the next day to another apartment  
and this seemed to work they found another  apartment nearby they got all their stuff  
there was a few little incidents that happened you  know an object moving a weird noise here and there  
but very quickly the whole poltergeist haunting  came to a quick and sudden end or so they thought  
because this is when something very strange  happened which they both feel is connected  
one evening this was probably about a week or  two after they moved into the new apartment  
they were sitting there in the living room  around 9 00 pm this was in 1989 i believe  
and uh suddenly they hear this very loud buzzing  noise first it sounded kind of like a transformer  
but it was getting louder and louder and louder  like you know a refrigerator they're wondering   where the heck it's coming from and suddenly  it sounds like a plane is coming to crash  
right on their apartment and by this point they're  terrified they're thinking oh my gosh it's the  
poltergeist it's back again what is going on and  they run out onto their balcony and get the shock  
of their life there is a very large craft hovering  directly overhead it's just maybe 200 feet high  
it's got very bright lights covering it it  appears to be very large 100 feet across at least  
u shaped sort of got a u or v shaped and uh it's  just hovering there they both had the distinct  
feeling it had come for them and was looking at  them and uh it's sort of posed for them they said  
and then as soon as it sort  of they sort of acknowledged   its presence it started to move it had been  hovering in place stock still now it started  
to move around a little bit sort of darting  back and forth circling around overhead coming  
a little bit closer and farther away and then  zipped off like a bullet and scared the living  
daylights out of them again they both think this  is somehow connected to their poltergeist haunting  
but at the same time they were are both absolutely  convinced this was a ufo it's almost as if this  
ufo appeared to sort of celebrate their uh having  overcome a spiritual battle with poltergeists  
uh hard to say but they think there's a connection  not and definitely so do i again this turns up in  
case after case after case it takes all  kinds of very interesting forms here's a  
very interesting case which is not unique this  is the one case i didn't personally investigate  
and i call this case a gray alien prevents  suicide this is a very profound and poignant case  
it occurred on april 10 1992 to an anonymous  gentleman who was suffering from suicidal  
depression and one day it just became too much  for him and he decided he was going to drive out  
into the high deserts of california  and end his life this is very tragic  
i'm not sure if you know this but suicide  according to the world health organization  
is the top 10 killer it's number 10 on the  list of what causes human deaths so this is  
a very huge problem in the united states and  the world and takes a lot of people's lives  
so this is what was happening to this  unfortunate gentleman he was suicidally   depressed and decided he was just going to  end his life he had a brought with him a 357  
magnum gun and actually held it up to his  temple and was ready to take his life when  
something very extraordinary happened as he  says and i'm quoting i was no more than 10  
seconds from pulling the trigger when i noticed  something moving out of the corner of my eye  
he turned and was shocked to see there was two  grey aliens as he says and again i'm quoting  
both stood facing me one motionless and  the other one leaning leaning just enough  
into my peripheral vision that i would see them  they were exactly like the small grays you see  
like in the roswell accident i  saw them 20 feet away from me   i even had a loaded gun and could have shot at  them and probably hit them but when i noticed that  
i was not alone it simply voided the suicide  and i left which i thanked them for really
he actually did have a period of  missing time which he estimates to be   about 10 hours it was dark at the time of this  incident and when he left it was actually light  
so there was a missing time aspect involved with  this but what's very interesting is they prevented  
him his suicide and actually removed his suicidal  ideations so that's extraordinary and shows just  
what a strong influence ufos and extraterrestrials  can have on a person's spiritual outlook  
and i've got another case very much like this i  interviewed the gentleman personally his name is  
david perez he's from west covina california and  it's the same sort of thing i call this case a ufo  
prevents suicide i covered this case  in my book extraterrestrial visitations  
and also in my book the healing power of ufos  because i think it's such an extraordinary case  
this all began when david was having a lot  of problems in his life he had a girlfriend  
but the relationship was sort of rocky and  he was they were having a lot of arguments  
and he was also unhappy he wasn't super happy uh  with his job he was also having health problems  
which were becoming increasingly severe he had a  strange pain in his side and a persistent cough he  
was sometimes coughing up blood so he was having  problems with his lungs he was having a lot of  
anxiety and stress and was just really unhappy so  one day he steps outside to smoke a cigarette and  
looked up and was shocked to see a ufo  he called out his girlfriend his cousin  
was there the neighbors came outside to watch it  they all saw this thing it was not very far away  
a few hundred feet high up in the sky and was  just hovering in place it was covered with lights  
uh they couldn't quite tell what shape it was  because these lights were so bright uh but it was  
definitely not normal it's just white lights uh  everyone else sort of went inside but he's staring  
at this thing thinking that there's something very  unusual to it when suddenly it beams him it sends  
sort of a red it turns red and sends this red beam  of light into him and as he says and i'm quoting  
this red bright light went on and it seemed  like it kind of penetrated my pupils and my  
vision turned red everything that i saw was  tinted red that's when i kind of got scared  
i thought i'd screwed up my vision i couldn't talk  and i couldn't move or anything i don't know if it  
was the fear or what but i just couldn't move  anything so this is certainly something that's  
commonly reported when someone's struck by  a beam of light from a ufo they can't move   this was very quick and suddenly was over  but it definitely seemed to affect him  
physically he went inside and told his girlfriend  but she was they became angry at each other  
started having a fight he did not want to  argue so he drove off and to his shock the  
ufo was still there and it actually followed him  down the highway and he drove many miles he went  
all the way from west covina to canoga park  california which is you know fairly distant  
and finally just pulled over because he had  calmed down by this point and was shocked to  
see that the ufo was still there it came swooping  down and hovered right over his car and this was  
when he got a profound feeling of comfort and  good will this is something i've heard in many  
other cases people have told me that they get this  very profound feeling of goodness and this is what  
he described and he's just suddenly at that point  knew that everything was going to be all right and  
sure enough it was and his life just completely  changed his health problems started clearing up  
and he started becoming increasingly spiritual  and i'll just let him describe in his own words uh  
this transformation that happened as a result of  his encounter as he says i was kind of stressed  
i've always had problems with my back i used to  cough up blood once in a while i was kind of sick  
i had pains in my chest and on my side ever since  that night i haven't had any pain at all and i  
was also suicidal ever since that night i haven't  been i've been good i've been feeling really good  
really healthy and it was more than just that he  started becoming very interested in meditation  
and precognition and  premonitions he started having  
dreams that came true clairvoyance premonitions  so this not only sort of healed him physically  
and it transformed him spiritually to the point  where he started having psychic visions and  
said he'd started becoming actually really  interested in god and this sort of thing  
as he says and again i'm quoting i kind of feel  for some strange reason that they have something  
to do with god ever since then i started talking  about god this is another thing i've seen people  
sort of start attending church again or they  perhaps stop attending church and start meditating  
in either case they become spiritually transformed  there's a very strong spiritual component to  
all of this and here's another case that speaks  towards this it's a really interesting connection  
i call this case flying saucer sickness  i cover this case in my book inside ufos  
i call the witness william trimble that's not his  real name i did interview him personally he was 12  
years old when he had his first ufo experience or  that's when he thought was the first one actually   it began much earlier as he would later find out  but at age 12 something very strange happened  
to him he lived in a small town in texas at this  time and he was a paper boy in seventh grade and  
each morning he'd have to get up really early to  deliver the morning paper it was a very tough job  
but he enjoyed it and uh early one sunday morning  he was out delivering papers it was morning but  
still very dark the sun had not risen yet and he's  riding his bike through the neighborhood throwing  
papers onto the sidewalk and in front of onto  people's porches and suddenly he sees this light  
approaching him and it comes from the horizon and  zooms very quickly and is right overhead it's a  
very bright sort of glowing white sphere and he's  looking at it trying to figure out what it could  
be when it sends down a beam of light which  strikes him he's disoriented for just a second  
next thing he knows he's standing next to his  bike looking up at this thing and it darts away  
except now it's daylight it looks like it's  around 8 or 9 am a couple of hours at least  
has passed uh he's completely freaking out uh  he doesn't know where the time has gone so he  
starts delivering the papers as quickly as as he  can there's a lot of angry customers waiting on  
their doorstep wondering where the heck he was  and why is he late with their paper anyway he  
returns home his mom is angry she wants to know  what's happened and he has no explanation for her  
he didn't want to tell her what happened because  he couldn't explain it himself and if he couldn't   understand it how could she so instead he just  goes to bed to catch a few hours of sleep and  
goes on with his life unfortunately he wasn't  able to go on with his life not in the way it  
had normally been because following this incident  he started to suffer this very strange symptom  
next time he went out to deliver papers he found  that he was very tired so tired he could barely  
bike up to the top of the hill his aim was off he  was having trouble throwing the paper he couldn't  
make it to the sidewalk anymore by the end of his  route he was completely exhausted walking his bike  
and had to crawl into bed following this his  weakness increased over the next few days to  
the point where he was having trouble getting up  in the morning and doing any physical activity  
his parents rushed him to the hospital the  doctors were completely baffled they couldn't   find anything wrong with him they thought it  might be some sort of blood disorder like a mania  
but that test came out negative so they could  not figure it out they prescribed him a sort of  
cocktail of vitamins and sent him home and said  that if anything should you know uh become worse  
to come back to the hospital it didn't become  worse but it didn't become better for the entire  
summer he was pretty much bedridden this caused  a huge transformation in his life i was normally  
a very active person now that he's stuck in  bed he had no choice but to just sit there   and meditate and he eventually got into reading  he became a voracious reader following this summer  
and after three months had gone by he finally  got his strength back he eventually recovered  
fully but he feels like perhaps he got some sort  of radiation sickness is what he now believes  
because at some point during his reading he came  across the subject of ufos and he wondered hey i  
wonder if this what's hap what happened to me  and as he grew up and learned more about ufos  
he began to realize that that's probably  what did happen he became a teacher he later  
became a college professor he married he had  children and he still kept on wondering about  
this weird incident in his life where he saw  a ufo and as he thought about he's like yep  
that's what i'm sure happened to me because  he started to hear about missing time on tv  
he also had a very strange incident occurred when  he was about four years old when he saw a strange  
bald-headed figure peering at him through the  uh window that's something that kept popping  
up into his memory until he finally connected  it he asked his uh sisters about it and they're   like oh yeah we remember it you were really  scared you screamed and we came running up  
and everyone believed him but they had  no idea you know who it could have been   so now he connects that to that and finally he  decided he was going to undergo hypnosis which  
he did he was a little disappointed because he  knew you know pretty much about ufo abductions  
at this point the guy who hypnotized and warned  him that this might contaminate his recall  
and what william ended up remembering was pretty  much your standard standard abduction scenario  
i said it was actually very frightening he  remembered being undressed and physically examined  
and that's about it he didn't see grays as is  normally described that kind of surprised him  
he said they were a little taller and the one  that he saw very clearly actually had sort of   a yellowish look to its skin and the  others appeared to have almost a greenish  
hue he said ultimately he didn't really  recall a whole lot other than being examined  
and as i said he was sort of disappointed but  he's convinced that ufos are a part of his life  
and he's also convinced that uh they have  affected him not only physically as he said  
with this weird symptom of losing all his energy  following this major encounter as a very young boy  
but have sort of spiritually transformed  him he's recently become very interested  
in hands-on healing and reiki and this sort of  thing sort of out of the blue um he's a college  
professor remember so this is really not sort  of the thing that he was into so to speak but  
following a sighting in march 1999 where this  ufo came swooping down right over his car  
and then disappeared he became very interested  in healing and has he's he says and i'm quoting  
i'm very interested in this chi energy business i  just got interested in that in the last two years  
so i went to a laying on of hands class to  tell you the truth i can't tell you if it is  
particularly helpful or not but my wife claims it  is so i'm glad to lay hands on my wife uh he jokes  
but yeah seriously this is something i see all  the time particularly with healing people become  
very interested in healing as a result of their  ufo encounter so that's why i wanted to include  
his case because it's fairly typical in this  regard and all right now i just want to cover one  
last case it's an amazing case i wrote about this  case in my book inside ufos the main witness it  
goes i call him kenneth that's not his real name  and i call this case you have a job to do this is  
an incredibly complex and long case so i want to  go into a little depth in here just because it's  
so interesting not only what happened to this  gentleman but how it spiritually transformed him  
his experiences were not particularly  pleasant they began when he was   just a young kid when he was six years  old when he started having a series of  
he has three older brothers none of them  had this problem but poor kenneth started   waking up at night with severe nosebleeds bad  enough that he had to be rushed to the hospital  
on a few occasions the doctors couldn't figure it  out they just prescribed a cocktail of vitamins  
again is what they gave him and eventually these  nosebleeds stopped he was around age nine when  
suddenly they just stopped his parents never could  figure it out kenneth however was keeping a little  
secret that he was not telling his parents or the  doctors he remembers little people coming into  
his room at night during this time during this  three year period sort of short dark figures he  
never got to see them clearly because his room was  very dark and they would only come in the middle   of the night but he and he didn't want to tell  anyone because he didn't know what to make of it  
and besides suddenly it ended so  there was no reason to tell anybody   following this he did start to become very  environmentally conscious and afraid that  
perhaps there was going to be major  earth changes he's not sure where   that came from but he started to really watch the  environment following this period of visitations  
and grew up he went to school went to college  became a nursing assistant got a job at a hospital  
and was around 25 years old when  very strange things started to happen  
let's see it was 1991 and he was driving home  one evening he often carpooled with a friend  
who i'll call alice he and alice were driving  to his home and her home in upstate new york and  
suddenly they saw this white orb pacing their  car it appeared to be pretty large actually  
and it was following them for quite a while their  radio started getting this weird staticky noise  
alice was pretty frightened uh but  kenneth found it pretty interesting   he finally just pulled over and got out of the car  and looked at this thing it's it stopped as well  
and he tried to get close to it but it would  always sort of move away he could only get   approached within about 100 to 200 feet of it  and alice was becoming extremely frightened and  
so he finally just got into the car and tried  to start it the car wouldn't start he was  
very confused about that and suddenly  the car just started and they took off  
went home alice found the whole experience very  frightening he found it interesting until he  
drops alice off at her home gets home and finds  out that he's missing about two hours of time  
this completely freaks him out he can't believe it  they go to work the next day they found out that  
there had been a wave of ufo sightings over their  area everyone was talking about it he's like wow  
you know i had this experience too or followed my  car and following this he started to have quite a  
few experiences it started occurring regularly  uh all sort of weird things started to happen  
uh he had a site i know on that evening that he  had this sighting both his brothers also saw ufos  
hovering over their homes that was kind of weird  and around this time you started getting weird  
phone calls you'd answer the phone it would just  be a weird buzzing noise or a weird clicking noise  
like someone clicking their tongue on the top  of their mouth is how he described it and that  
was strange then in 1998 he's driving along when  he encountered a ufo covering the entire road in  
front of him and he didn't have missing time he  doesn't think this thing just suddenly took off  
he goes home but the next morning he woke up and  he had a very strange triangular bruise on his arm  
two years later he's driving  to a bar to meet some friends   and finally gets there and they're like where  the heck were you you're three hours late the  
bar is closing he was missing three hours of  time had no memory of seeing any ufo at all  
by this point he's starting to have dreams of ufos  of light hitting his car um visions of gray et's  
this sort of thing so he's starting to  realize what's going on with him but he's   still sort of deep in denial and doesn't want to  face the fact that ufos are a part of his life  
instead he decides he's just going to move to  florida and leave everything behind and run away   from it all he gets a job in florida gets a rents  a little house there and sure enough these ufos  
start making more appearances uh in 2002 he's  driving home and he sees this white orb pacing his  
car you can actually feel this very strong heat in  his car yeah he has missing time and arrives home  
two hours late he starts getting more weird calls  they're always on tuesday or thursday evening  
uh he can sometimes hear something apparently  talking but he can't quite understand it   it's too fast lots of clicks and weird noises and  buzzing noises and uh just weird stuff like this  
in 2004 he went out to walk his dog and  saw this orb again it was flashing colors  
this time it was really beautiful and he  asked are you the one that's talking to me  
and it suddenly flashed at him next thing he  knows it's the next morning he's waking up in bed  
and his dog is outside the neighbor's knocking  on his door and returns his dog to him and  
the dog is just completely shook up it has  post-traumatic stress of some kind of comes   goes running into its little kennel where it  sleeps and won't come out and at this point  
kenneth finds out that he goes to the bathroom  and find out that he has a very severe sunburn   on his head and chest and he's no  idea how that could have happened  
so that kind of upset him and again reminded him  that he was having problems with missing time and  
ufos in 2004 it happened again he had just invited  a friend over and the friend was just showing  
up as uh kenneth was beginning to walk his dog  just at the same exact moment this ufo shows up  
can his friend seize this orb and just takes off  gets in his car and leaves he later said he'd got  
a very strong message that he was not supposed to  be there at the time he didn't even think about it  
he just left as quickly as he could and kind of  sees this object and next thing he knows he has  
missing time and it's the next morning he wakes  up in his bed he has no clothes on his clothes are  
all in a pile on the floor his dog is back in  its kennel shaking uncontrollably very scared his  
front door is wide open and the entire house is  filled with bugs because the light had been left  
on apparently all night and it took him three  days to clear the house of insects actually  
and at this point he knew what was happening  he had been taken again he thought perhaps he  
was going crazy he wanted to believe he was  crazy but he realized that this was probably  
something to do with ufo abductions and uh he  wasn't going to be able to run away he had just  
gotten into a car accident around this time and  had a lot of problems with medical bills and uh  
meeting his expenses so he decided he's gonna move  back to new york where he could make more money  
and that's what he did he moved back to new  york and continued to have ufo encounters they  
would come once or twice a year in 2006 he was  driving home when a ufo appeared and beamed his  
car he had two hours of missing time following  this incident he started having images of grays  
appear in his mind he was really shook up was  having you know kind of some dreams about this uh  
and uh could was having flashes of memory sort  of flashbacks involving being examined or seeing  
instruments falling down from the  ceiling and telescoping towards him   he sought therapy and the therapist finally told  him no you're not crazy what you need is a ufo  
expert because it looks to me like these are  real experiences and i know nothing about this  
you need to seek out a professional and so that  upset and so he started to realize that it's time  
he has to face this phenomenon um one time he's  driving home when his uh cell phone rings and he  
had it set to a certain song as his ringer and  that's not what went off and said it was this  
weird set of beeping tones that the phone can't  even make he picked it up and it said no number  
and uh it rang several times finally he just  answered it and he heard this weird clicks and  
buzzes it's that same thing that he always hears  except this time after the clicks and buzzes he  
he heard a voice and it said very quickly in the  sort of high-pitched voice we are coming soon soon  
you will know the reason so yeah he was called by  e.t on his cell phone i know how this sounds but  
i actually put out a video about cases just like  this where et's call people on their cell phone  
so it's not as strange or unique as you might  think it happened to betty andreas in it happened   to debbie jordan you know bud hopkins star client  of intruders so as where as that sounds this does  
happen and uh it's definitely happening to kenneth  ut contact comes in a wide variety of forms  
and it was around this time that his experiences  were coming to a real climax apparently  
he started hearing a voice in his head sort  of a chorus of voices and they kept saying  
sort of the same thing we know where you are we  are coming soon soon you will know the reason  
it was very various uh sort of forms of that  message variations of that same message came  
over and over again over the next few weeks and  uh he was pretty concerned about it because it  
appeared that they were coming again for a major  encounter and that's exactly what happened uh one  
day he was lying in bed and they you heard this  chorus of voices that he always hears in his head  
that said we are here we are  here now and now is the time and  
he lay there in bed wondering what to do when  suddenly things start to get very strange and   he found himself being pulled out of his bedroom  and into a craft presumably a craft he can't say  
for sure it's just suddenly he found himself  inside it uh he does not know how we got there   we call this doorway amnesia a lot of people  do not remember how they're taken into these  
apparent craft so suddenly he finds himself inside  this room he's being physically examined there are  
grays there he's fully conscious he's strangely  calm but uh pretty emotional nevertheless  
uh because this is absolutely a fully conscious  experience and the grace talked to him and they  
said we wanted your experience to make sense  to you we have revealed to you why we chose you  
we are not here to hurt you and they showed  him a child and said that this was his child  
and it was a small gray human alien hybrid  very young and kenneth felt this huge rush  
of emotions a very powerful wave of mixed emotions  he felt an enormous amount of love for this child  
uh he thought the child was absolutely  beautiful but at the same time he was  
horrified because this child was not human  and there was sort of an ugly aspect to it  
so he felt sort of repulsed at the same  time he wanted to hold the child but he  
also did not want to and he felt this intense wave  of anger at the et's and told them that they had  
no right to do this and how could they do this  to him and they seemed surprised by his anger  
they seemed very proud of the child and what  they had done and told him only we wanted your  
experiences to make sense to you and now  we have revealed to you why we chose you
and the experience sort of just ended at this  point and he woke up the next morning so that was  
sort of his last fully conscious experience and  following that he stopped having a lot of missing  
time he still does he still occasionally does see  orbs and have incidents and memories of you know  
being visited but what's interesting it was around  this time that all these missing time incidents  
happened uh from year to year following you know  when he moved from new york to florida and back  
to new york something else was happening he  started having very powerful premonitions  
he started having a lot of dreams of what appeared  to be prophetic events and often what would happen  
is he'd be walking along he'd be at the store he'd  be at work he'd be just driving down the street  
when a chorus of voices would start talking in  his head you have a job to do you have a job to do  
and he would start seeing images over a person's  head he could see lights he could see their aura  
and he would feel utterly compelled to approach  this person and impart spiritual advice  
or some sort of psychic reading so to speak in  fact it was so strong he was really unor able to  
resist this impulse he just found himself  blurting out messages as they came to him  
and always it would begin  with the grays shouting out   in a chorus of voices you have a job to do and  they'd point out the person that he had to talk to  
so one incident occurred shortly after the 1991  encounter he was walking down the street when  
suddenly he heard the voices saying you've got  a job to do and he saw a woman and they directed  
him towards this woman and unable to resist he  walked up to her and he says i don't know why i'm  
telling you this you just need to go home you need  to go home to your husband you need to go home now  
and she asked him why why he says i don't  know why i don't know why i couldn't tell   you you just need to go home and so  she did and he felt really embarrassed  
he always feels embarrassed when suddenly he  feels compelled to give out these messages   but he can't resist it and normally he doesn't  hear back from these people you know he's one  
people of car accidents of illness of all  kinds of things and never hears back but  
it was about a year or two later he was in the  grocery store when he saw this woman in line  
she was in a separate line she saw him and  her face lit up and she left her line and  
started to approach him he's like oh no here's  this woman because he remembered who it was   and he's she said hey you're that man you're that  man who told me to go home that night aren't you  
and he felt a little bit embarrassed he's like  yeah yeah i'm sorry about that it's like no no   don't be sorry i'm very very thankful you did you  wouldn't believe what happened and he was very  
interested to hear what she said she said that  she had gone home that evening and spent just a  
wonderful evening with her husband being close  to him talking to him and enjoying the evening  
and that night he died in his sleep he passed  away in his sleep she said if she hadn't gone  
home she would have completely missed all of that  evening that wonderful spiritual evening that last  
evening she had with the person she loved most in  her life so she couldn't have thanked him enough  
and so this is the sort of thing that is happening  to him now and he says it's become a driving  
force in his life he's now able to give psychic  readings at will and is actually really good at it  
as kenneth says i'll quote him directly it's  probably happened 13 or 14 times now i have to  
admit even after all this time it's unexpected and  sometimes it can be overwhelming because i don't  
know how to turn it off once in a great while i'll  pass somebody and i'll see white flashes of light  
swirling around their heads and i'm compelled to  tell them things there's nothing that could make  
me stop it's like somebody else is controlling  my throat my voice my mouth my jaw muscles it's  
almost like having a gun held to my head there's  nothing that can stop me from opening my mouth  
to tell them what they need to know i would say  that more than half the messages are positive  
for instance i remember one man i haven't seen  him since i told him be sure to check the brakes  
on your car because i could see him sliding  into an accident so yeah as i said now he's  
at the point where he can pretty much use it  anytime he's not a professional psychic reader  
but he finds himself continually reading people  and has become completely spiritually transformed  
obviously as a result of his encounters and  again i'll just quote kenneth directly as he says  
i can actually do readings at will i can meet  a person and all of a sudden i'm telling them  
the directions they need to go in i'm telling them  things about their past things about their future  
sometimes i'm telling them things about their  health or what they need to watch out for   so it's clear to me that this is related to  his ufo encounters because it's something i  
see all the time some people have been  told directly by the ets that this  
is a spiritual gift that we have given to  you as a result for what you have given to us  
sort of a quid pro quo and this sort of strong  psychic ability is something that's i'm going  
to say very common among ufo experiencers and it  appears that they are actually waking this ability  
up in people in some cases they seem to be  attracted to people who may already be psychic   but in more cases it looks like they're actually  responsible for sort of igniting this awareness  
within people and it's very strong in kenan's  case which is why i wanted to include it he like  
many people is having dreams about earth changes  in upcoming disasters and he has this one same  
dream all the time it's a dream i've heard from  a number of people many people dream about seeing  
ufos in large numbers in the sky coming down  to rescue people so that i find interesting  
because that's a very consistent dream and  here's another very consistent dream also  
involving a sort of a pop apocalyptic event i'll  just quote kenneth directly here as kenneth says  
this is a recurring dream i have it several times  a month and this has been going on for a few years  
i have dreams where i'm seeing people crawling  in the streets and i'm trying to warn them don't   drink the water don't go near the water i can  see the sun and i can even feel in these dreams  
i can feel the heat and i can see people dying or  near death in the streets i can see people who are  
alive and i can see them crawling towards a stream  or towards a ditch that might be filled with water  
a number of people have described the same  sort of dream of cars stopped on the highway   or the sky looking altered all yellow the  water being poisonous some sort of apocalyptic  
event environmentalism is definitely a very  strong message and waking people up to their own  
spiritual heritage i think is one of the main  agendas one of the et's main agendas and it's  
something that they are trying very hard to do  and that's kind kind of why i wanted to present  
these cases so that's seven cases and let me just  present one more because it's a really good case  
and it speaks it speaks exactly towards this  and it's the same sort of thing this is a lady i  
interviewed by the name of pat brown she's this a  beautiful woman she's of african-american heritage  
and she had this really incredible experience she  was very skeptical of things paranormal she was a  
telephone operator and just sort of living  a normal life in her condominium in pacoima  
california and her friend asked her to visit  sedona arizona and talk to these watkins  
people who claimed to channel extraterrestrials  pat wasn't really interested but she decided  
to humor her friend and go ahead so they this  was in 1988 they drove down to sedona arizona  
stayed in a hotel and went to this convention  where there where there were these channelers  
who channeled you know presumably or so they  claimed extraterrestrials and pat is talking  
to one of these channelers and said okay if  this is true i would like to meet you she had a  
question and was able to ask them says you know  i'd like to meet you guys and go on your ship  
and they said okay we will arrange it and  she wasn't really expecting anything but  
uh turned out she did have experiences she  saw this glowing figure in her hotel room  
she thought that was very strange and thought that  might be connected to this but wasn't sure she  
went back home and to her condominium in pakuna  california and that's when she started having  
very scary and experiences with gray ets they  would come into her bedroom and take her away  
they'd say don't be afraid you need to come with  us but she was terrified and that's usually all  
she remembered is them just coming into her  room and she would pass out and she'd wake up  
the next morning just petrified and this went on  for months and it was just draining her physically  
and spiritually and she was just having a really  hard time with it she had a missing pregnancy  
that upset her badly the doctor couldn't explain  it at all uh her pregnancy had just disappeared  
so she was not happy about what was happening to  her especially because of this whole fear aspect  
and then one night she was just crying because  she could feel them coming and she's like if   you're coming you know that's it i don't want to  be afraid anymore if you're coming i just want to  
be on board a ufo right now and stop having this  fear suddenly she found herself fully conscious  
on board a ufo and she was not afraid she said  the air was very silky the atmosphere was pleasant  
she was taken to what appeared to be her  own quarters they told her this is where   you stay when you're with us it was very sparsely  furnished just sort of a little bed and a desk and  
they took her to another room and showed her  an enlightened master who appeared to be human  
he was glowing and she asked why do you look  like this and the being said this is because this  
form is one that you find pleasing and it started  talking to her and giving her all these wonderful  
spiritual messages this being told her uh that  she has a masculine side and a feminine side  
and actually showed her this sort of energetically  in her body i talked to her about out-of-body  
experiences actually took her out of her body and  showed her her mask inside her feminine inside  
uh showed her this sort of negative  band of energy that surrounds our planet  
it told her that there's this dark mass of  negative thought forms that are choking our planet  
and this is all the negative feelings and the  greed and the fear that people are putting out and  
that we need to stop doing this so that was one  of the main messages it gave her and uh was just  
giving all these wonderful messages of healing and  from that point her experiences completely changed  
she still feels you know somewhat violated and  that they came to her and caused a lot of trauma  
but uh on the other hand she became  spiritually transformed and she recognizes this  
she actually quit her job as a telephone opera  operator and opened a alternative healing  
clinic where she actually worked at one and  does hands-on healing and is very effective  
at it people say they've seen blue light  coming out of her hands she's got a number   of first-hand testimony testimonials attesting  to the fact that her healings actually work  
and she says she can feel the energy coming  through her hands and not only that as she   is doing these healings she gets an image of the  grays sitting in their little craft operating a  
console and sort of moving the little oven dials  and lights to assist her with the healing using  
their technology to actually help her heal  which i find very interesting and she says  
that these experiences have completely spiritually  transformed her over just a period of a few years  
she doesn't even recognize herself as she says  and i'm quoting i'm a completely different person  
and not only is she interested in all this healing  stuff she started having a lot of premonitions and  
dreams which come true as i said this is a  very consistent feature of these encounters  
so that's why i wanted to make this presentation  to just remind people that ufos are not purely a  
nuts and bolts phenomena there is often if not  always a very strong spiritual component it is  
connected definitely to who we are as human  beings and does seem to be one of the main  
et agendas to wake us up to our own spirituality  our own incredible talents as spiritual beings
and the reason i say that is because uh we see  this connection of people seeing ufos after having  
a spiritual quest or you know having an encounter  and then suddenly being spiritually awakened  
and this involves a very wide variety of  paranormal phenomena everything from out-of-body  
experiences to channeling to remembering past  lives to hands-on healing i know one guy he became  
a douser started doing water dowsing uh other  people have had spontaneous episodes of levitation  
physically levitating or giving psychic readings  like happened in kenneth's case a wide variety  
of really interesting stuff some people become  mediums it's just across the board and that's why  
i wanted to talk about this because it's a very  important aspect of ufo encounters thanks again  
for watching and i hope you enjoyed  the presentation and keep having fun
