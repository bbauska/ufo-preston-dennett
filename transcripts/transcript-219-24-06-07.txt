A face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s happening to a lot of people. It’s been happening all over the world for a very long time. While governments across the world are admitting that UFOs are real, they refuse to talk about firsthand contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids. These include multiple witness cases with a wide variety of supporting evidence. Time for truth!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. It was 10am one summer morning in 1948 when Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and two others were on the Canadian National Railroad by Chapais, Quebec, Canada when a UFO appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, quickly fled. The UFO flew off with a noise so loud, it made the witnesses physically ill.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland when a tall green humanoid appeared, floating above his head. Anssi biked away in fear. The being disappeared into a craft, which continued to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a weird liquid as Anssi raced home.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms by his home in Bedarrides, France when he saw what appeared to be two small children. But they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, several children from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object approach. In moments, it came overhead, stopped, and landed a short distance away. Both boys saw a humanoid looking out at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with porthole hovering near their farm. It then ejected two figures with glowing red eyes who approached the farm and began to inspect the sheds. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the environment around him lit up like daylight, and a UFO appeared on a nearby hill. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by four humanoids. He fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10pm on November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was in his home in Daviken, Sweden when he noticed an odd-looking figure in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture, and was wearing a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to investigate, the figure disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police officer had an encounter the same night, and his neighbor also saw a strange humanoid.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one evening in the summer of 1999 when a 14-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching sound coming from outside the second-story bedroom window of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange 3-foot-tall creature with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed in, and saw it too. The creature remained for 15 minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a tiny portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. We are being visited.

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode is
called astonishing 10 cases of extraterrestrial contact I love covering these humanoid
cases there's so many of them they're so fascinating and they've got a lot to
teach us about UFOs ETS why they're here what they're doing and what it's like to
have direct contact with them I've chosen 10 cases which I think you probably haven't heard before they're
mostly little known obscure cases but they do cover a wide range of time all
the way from the 1940s up to 1999 so that's six Decades of course
they do come from all over the world I love covering cases over a wide geographic area and the cases I've
chosen today come from all across Europe including Germany France Italy
Sweden Norway and Finland but other places as well including one case from
Australia more specifically the island of Tasmania there's a case from Canada
one from the United States and one from South America argena so yeah all over the world these
of course do involve all different types of humanoids as we'll see some of these are multiple witness cases a good number
of them have supporting evidence of various kind including of course
physiological effects electromagnetic disturbances some really interesting
Landing Trace cases and more so quite a few cases Each of which I think have
something to offer in terms of our understanding of the UFO phenomenon so let's just get started and
the first case is really interesting for a number of reasons I call this one a shocking
experience this occurred all the way back in the summer of 1948 in a rural area of hemmer
Germany I like this case because it is a very early case long before UFOs were at
all popular it's also interesting because it's got some really profound
animal reactions physiological effects as well as Landing
traces this very early report of a landed UFO and ETS was published in the
German language book D andrin which translates to the others and it was
written by johans PhD he's the author of many books on UFOs and the
Paranormal the main witness is a shepherd and Forest inspector by the name of Ernst August and his last
initial is R so we don't know his full last name but it was a summer morning around 10 a.m. in
1948 and Ernst was looking after his flock of sheep in an isolated grassy
area located in HR hammer in the province of sourland
Germany suddenly without any warning all of his sheep scattered while at the same
time Ernst heard this strange rushing sound and looking up and in front of him
he saw a strange quote artificial fog and emerging from it was a very large
object a craft of some kind about 100 ft long and 10 ft high he
estimates but this craft quickly landed on the ground and then it just remained
there Ernst watched in shock waiting for further development and when nothing happened
for several minutes he decided he would approach this object which he did he slowly walked up to it reached out to
touch its smooth metallic surface and instantly a strong electric shock
knocked him to the ground rendering him unconscious he awoke sometime later and
he found that he was now more than 250 ft away from where he had been and
standing all around him were 3-ft tall creatures with large heads with short
stubby hair he said and bulging foreheads he said they had large slanting almond-shaped eyes a small nose
and narrow mouths he also noticed that they had small boxes attached to their chest area
with what looked like tubes hanging down from them he later believed that these
might be some sort of breathing device as periodically they would grab a tube and they seemed to draw air from it but
they were standing around him gesticulating speaking to each other in a foreign language that he was unable to
understand but looking over to where he had been Ernst could now see that this
object was still there landed on the ground still enveloped in this strange mist and standing next to it were four
or five other humanoids who looked the same as the ones that were around him
these other ones next to the ship appeared to be examining the soil and vegetation and were in fact collecting
samples and putting them into large containers after just a few minutes of
this the beings standing around Ernst began to walk back to their craft they
all joined together and entered back inside of this craft which promptly took off making a high whining sound and flew
rapidly away to the South it was now about 10:40 Ernst says so the whole
encounter lasted somewhere around 30 minutes but looking at where this craft
had rested on the ground the witness found six to8 round spots of burned
vegetation each was about 8 ft apart and three 3 ft in diameter now a friend of Ernst heard
about this case later examined the landing traces and he wondered if perhaps Ernst had set campfires to make
these Landing traces Ernst of course denies this and furthermore he says that the skin on his face was burned slightly
was painful when exposed to the Sun so kind of like a sunburn and in further support of his experience there were
actually numerous cylindrical objects seen repeatedly throughout the summer of
1948 in this area and the surrounding areas I think this is an important case
because there's a real important takeaway from it probably not a good idea to walk up to a landed UFO there's
quite a few cases where people have regretted it and I think this is another example of it it's also interesting that
while this is a single witness case it does have quite a bit of corroborating evidence with the land traces the animal
reactions the physiological effects and the many people in the area who were
seeing UFOs around the same time so it's an important case and a very early one
now let's move to the next one which is equally fascinating I like this case for a number of reasons it's quite an
unusual craft it behaved in a very unusual way the humanoid is kind of unusual too but
it's also a mult multiple witness case I call this one a very loud UFO this
occurred in July of 1960 in the very small town of chapp
this is in Canada and it's an interesting case involving some really
interesting physiological effects the primary investigator to this case was
Canadian researcher Michelle laah and this case was published in Gan
Ferguson's book Le human noad or the humanoids so it was about 2:00 in the
afternoon in July of 1960 and George godbout and two of his
Railway co-workers were repairing the tracks of the Canadian national railroad
located in the town of chapp again in Quebec Canada it's a pretty small town
of less than 2,000 people originally founded as a mining Community but later
became a for forestry uh community so important here is that the
Canadian national railroad runs along its Southern border this is a very rural
area so they're out there working these three men when suddenly they heard a
very loud penetrating sound which they described as being quote like a humming
top now this already loud sound increased in volume to the point that
all of them began to feel physically ill from from it and it was at this point that they all three saw a bright
metallic object coming towards them just above the train tracks was following the train tracks and it approached to within
about 900 ft of them and then it left the tracks and hovered at low elevation
over this bog that was next to the railroad tracks the witnesses said that this object was shaped like a top it
appeared to have a metallic green texture and it was giving off flashes of light
so they're watching this thing when suddenly a door opens and a small ladder extends downward and coming down this
ladder is a humanoid that they described as quote well proportioned he was not very tall about
5T 2 in they estimate and he climbs down this ladder and upon reaching the ground
he just stood there looking around him in a weird fashion kind of twisting his entire body to gaze in various
directions the witnesses did say that he appeared to be dressed in a skintight green
uniform which covered his entire body all the way down to his feet he was
wearing a round helmet which completely enclosed his entire head and where his
face would be there was sort of a grill which reminded them of a catcher's mask so apparently perceiving that he
was being observed by these men this humanoid quickly climbed back up into
the craft which rose with a quote intolerable noise this craft immediately
flew back over the tracks the way it had come and at this point the sound was so
incredibly loud that the three track workers instantly threw themselves into
the ditch and covered their ears with their hands as this object departed and disappeared off into the distance they
said the noise was actually so loud that it made them physically sick to the point that they were unable to work for
the rest of the day they wanted to explore the area where this UFO had hovered when this guy
came down and stood there but they couldn't as it was an impassible bog love those multiple witness cases
they're very hard to deny when you have a lot of people seeing the same thing
and what an unusual case because most UFOs are described as being very silent though this one was so loud it actually
caused a physiological reaction to the witnesses I'm not sure what the UFO is
doing following down those train tracks and the way that it was but perhaps the
fact that this town was very rich in mining uh could be a factor here really
hard to say but certainly an important and interesting case and now we move to the next one
which is really unusual and has some unique elements that I don't think I've heard before I call this one sprayed by
a UFO this is a single witness case doesn't have a whole lot of evidence to
it but it's such an unusual series of events and the main Witness by all
accounts is a very honest and sincere person this occurred on September 30
1971 in the town of martilla Finland and yeah a really unusual case
that I don't think you've heard before I'm guessing but I have haven't heard it before I was quite amazed when I came
upon it because yeah it's very unusual in terms of what happened to this
witness as well as the description of the humanoid that he saw this case comes
from researcher usco hinan and it occurred in a rural area of martilla
this is in turku Finland and the main witness is an 11-year-old boy by the name of anzi
hakala anzi had gone to visit his cousin to celebrate his cousin's birthday
and afterwards I believe this is late afternoon though it's not specifically stated Anie was bicycling back to his
home along a narrow forested road this road was filled with potholes and
puddles from a recent rain and Anie was only about onethird of a mile from his
home and he was approaching a puddle he looked down to avoid it and this is when
he noticed the foot of a strange being now this really shocked him because it
was not a human looking foot whoever this foot belonged to was wearing strange foot gear that reminded anzie of
an astronaut's suit and it frightened him badly enough that he didn't take any time to stop or look at it but just
biked away as fast as he could now a short distance later he reached the top
of a small hill and he looked up and got an incredible shock because he now saw a
hand of a creature was apparently floating right above him and looking up
yes it was cuz he saw that there was in fact a large humanoid floating just over
his head it was weird because it was hovered in a sort of seated position and
was less than 2 feet above the ground right over the back of his bicycle so he
quickly turned around to get a better look at it and immediately the creature
withdrew but he got a pretty good look at it he noticed very quickly that this being was just under 6 ft tall
incredibly thin the Lo the legs were extraordinarily long taking up at least 2/3 of its body
length he said the arms reached all the way down to its knees it had a very
large bald head with no visible ears that he could see the nose consisted of
two vertical slits and the mouth was just a little line he says its eyes were
quite large round and they seemed to almost glow with white light he also
said its neck was very thin its shoulders were quite narrow and the color of the creature itself was light
green with some darker spots now he did look at it for only a few seconds as he
was still moving on his bicycle quite quickly and he looked back again and the
creature was now gone but in its place and he was shocked to see this he now
saw a large shiny metallic craft floating up in the sky behind him he was
amazed that the creature was gone this quickly and he assumes it went into this craft though we can't say for sure but
this craft he estimates was about 20 ft wide concave on the bottom with a rim
around the edge sort of oval in shape but to On's fear this object was moving
closer towards him at an angle from the right side in fact it was coming so
close Onie actually swerved his bike to avoid it he could clearly hear it making
a strange sound which he said reminded him of quote two Rusty pieces of iron
rubbing against each other so yeah it was very loud he said and it moved right
over his head some feet up and it stayed there it actually followed him for about
600 to 700 ft as was later determined by investigators Onie did notice some
interesting details whenever the branches from the trees draped over the road this craft would swerve to avoid
them but still managed to stay directly above his head pacing him the whole way
and at one point it moved down quite low to a height of he estimates about 15t
over his head and then started to rise Upward at which point it sprayed a
strange liquid he says directly onto his body this made a sort of hissing sound
as it passed through the air anzi could feel the liquid hitting his hands and face he didn't smell anything he doesn't
know what it was but as it touched his skin it caused a kind of quote tickling
sensation so needless to say this made him even more frightened he continued on
his bike never stopping and went all the way home as fast as he could now shortly
before reaching his home he did see the object make a sudden 90° turn and then
it flew very quickly towards the southeast but the object was over his head the entire time so he was never
able to see what the top of it looked like only the bottom reaching his house
he said the liquid on his face had evaporated it was now dry this tickling sensation had stopped and researchers
were really unable to explain his case now while they researched the case they
did find a weather balloon with a radio sound device this was found about four
days later and one mile from the site and investigators seriously considered
the possibility that this was what anzi had seen But quickly discarded this
theory for several reasons first Anie had said that this object moved very
swiftly over his head was following him exactly intentionally avoiding the trees
furthermore the object that he saw was metallic it did not look like a balloon it was the wrong shape he didn't see any
device hanging under it he saw it move at right angles and of course it doesn't
explain the strange creature that he saw so yeah clearly not a
balloon it is a single witness case again but Anie was described as quote a
calm and quiet boy not particularly imaginative he never thought about UFOs
hadn't read any UFO books his parents found no reason to doubt his story and
those who knew him all said he was honest this is what they told the investigators who looked into the case
it's really amazing how many cases there are I can only imagine what it must have been like for anzy to be riding his
bicycle and suddenly find himself being pursued by this ET floating above him
and this UFO that was pacing him for a good portion of his trip back home so
yeah an unusual and important case and here's another one which I like because
I think it shows a human side to the ETS they're often portrayed as being something completely different from us
and the more I study this subject it looks like they're very much like us I call this one the Laughing aliens this
occurred on September 27 1973 in a rural area of bed France and
while it is a single witness case it's got some very interesting elements to it as well as what appear to be landing
traces this very unusual case garnered considerable attention and was later
published in the muon journal the French magazine uranos and most notably in an
article by Jean Pierre trod in the French magazine lumier Donan which means
lights in the night the main witness is known only as Antoine we do not know his
last name he was a mechanic at the time but is now retired and at the time of
his encounter he lived in bid this is near aeno in southeast France his
encounter occurred right outside this area on a small hill known as M Mount real not far from his home so it
was about 5:30 p.m. on the evening of September 27
1973 and anine had gone to collect some edible mushrooms he was carrying a
basket and he hiked to this area cuz mushrooms grew grew there in great
profusion so he's collecting his mushrooms filling up his basket with them and he saw a big clump of mushrooms
and he started to bend down and pick them up when looking up he noticed a very short figure standing at the edge
of the clearing picking something up off the ground it was quite close to him
standing up and Twan could see that this figure was about 4T tall and immediately
a second 4 foot tall being emerged from the brush right next to this first one
now Antoine immediately noted that these two figures looked so similar they could have been Twins and they were both
staring at him from a distance of he estimates about 80 to 100 feet so pretty
close they both wore beige colored overalls which Antoine described as
quote beautiful these covered the entire body pretty much went up to the neck he
said that they were were wearing what looked like black Berets on their head they were both quite slender but other
than their short stature did have a human appearance and in fact he assumed
that they were children out there probably to collect mushrooms and he shouted out to them that there were
plenty of mushrooms to collect but as they stared at him he
decided that they were probably not children or he began to wonder because
they looked somewhat peculiar their complex ction was very pale and also their features were abnormally fine and
then there was the fact that they were identical in appearance so all of this was quite odd and he after he tells them
about there being mushrooms here both the beings laughed at him that was his
impression they immediately turned and entered into the underbrush behind them
he noticed that one of them bent down beneath a lwh hanging Branch as they left now anine was still thinking
himself could these be children are they going to fetch a basket to collect mushrooms like he was but moments later
he changed his mind and he got a huge surprise it was literally just seconds later when he saw a large oval object
rising from behind the brush where these two beings had been and Twan said that
this object was dull blue gray metallic and appearance it had no visible
markings or Port holes of any kind it was he estimates it's pretty big about
17 ft long 7 ft high and he estimates that it was about 60 ft away from him as
it rose up and moved slightly towards him now it was making a sort of soft whistling sound as it Rose to a height
of about 20 ft it stopped for one full second then accelerated horizontally at
a very high rate of speed to the Northeast as it did this Antoine ran up
the hill just a short ways to get a clear view of this object as it moved off towards Mount ventu but the object
was out of view in only a few seconds at no time did Antoine feel any
fear but he was really surprised that the time between The Disappearance of these two figures and the craft rising
up from the trees was only a few seconds so the whole experience was
quite surprising to him but the idea of extraterrestrials from another world was
the farthest thing from his mind he never thought of that instead he wondered if these little men might be
Chinese spies it's a theory he still wondering but he did go to the location
where this craft had come up and he found something very peculiar there was a bush there and the grass around it all
had been partially flattened but not all the way to the ground indicating that this object may have hovered about 1
foot or so above the ground so he went back to his neighborhood he did tell people about it
shortly after this encounter but he quickly regretted it as they did not
believe him actually made fun of him and ridiculed him but to his credit he did
contact investigators primarily because he was curious if they could help him to
understand what he saw and he wanted to know if others had had a similar experience or if anyone had seen
this researcher Jean Pierre codek interviewed him personal and calls him
quote a gentleman who shows a certain scholar I can say that this gentleman is
one of the most balanced has his feet firmly on the ground is not at all
interested in science fiction and is very serious he was very Cooperative with the investigation despite that he
no longer wants to hear about what he saw because the people in his commune put him more or less in a box
since now Antoine did revealed to Jean Pierre a very interesting fact 18 years
earlier he had seen a UFO with the daughter of the local mayor and this
object that he saw years earlier was strikingly similar in appearance to what
he had just seen it was again a blue gray metallic looking craft oval in
shape and around the same size and was totally silent he and the other witness
watched it for about 20 seconds before before it quickly moved away I do wonder about this case given the fact that the
witness saw this UFO well before this main encounter and described it in
exactly the same way makes me wonder if he might be a contacte cuz it's quite
unusual to have that close of an encounter with humanoids and it be a one-off I have to say this does happen
it's really hard to say maybe they were there picking mushrooms uh like the witness I I don't know but gosh so many
cases and here's another one which I found fascinating I like this case this
next one because it does involve a group of witnesses does involve a humanoid as
well that always makes it more interesting to me I call this one UFO at
a youth camp this occurred on Fe February 3rd
1977 at 7 Mile Beach in Tasmania which is of as an island off of Australia I
don't hear a whole lot of cases coming from this area I think that alone makes this case interesting but it's also
interesting because so many witnesses saw this UFO at this Youth Camp and they
saw humanoid as well really makes me wonder what this UFO was up to this next
case is admittedly quite brief sparse on details but it comes from the Tasmanian
UFO investigation Center and was written up in a few minut magazines it was in
fact the first report from Tasmania for that year it took place at a youth camp
at 7 Mile Beach and it was around 9:30 p.m. again on February 3rd
1977 when a group of several children from this Youth Camp were playing near the beach when one of them heard a
strange noise and looking up saw a strange quote something hovering in
place as this object began to move behind the trees she immediately alerted
the other children and all of the children saw it they described it as a dome shaped object with a row of windows
in the middle and they said it was flashing white yellow lights along the perimeter of the desk it had a round
white light on the bottom and a red light on the top of the Dome now one of
the children described it very specifically as looking like quote two saucers stuck together and she said it
appeared to be spinning fast rotating but slowed down as they looked at it all
of them could hear a faint whining noise coming from it and all of them noticed
something else there was a figure a humanoid figure visible in one of the
windows they described it as having an abnormally large round head and a very
thin body one girl said she saw a high collar around its neck they saw that it
had arms as well this figure seemed to be moving back and forth behind the window this was a
fairly brief sighting they saw it for only a few moments when the object went behind the trees and moved out of view
so that is admittedly a pretty brief case somewhat sparse on details but
really interesting with some direct quotes from the firsthand Witnesses and with so many cases like
this where UFOs kind of just show themselves briefly to to maybe one
person or a group of people I have come to the conclusion that there is something of a publicity campaign going
on on part of the ETS they're showing themselves to people whether it's individually or in small groups or
sometimes to much larger crowds but that seems to be what's going on here hard to
say for sure I've said it before one person's sighting might be another person's onboard experience so maybe
they were coming to pick somebody up maybe one of those kids was a contact impossible to say for sure without
further research but again another really interesting case and now to the
next one and I have to say I think this next one is probably my favorite of this
episode it's just a really interesting and poignant case actually uh I call
this one UFO lands at school for the deaf this one occurred on October 25
1977 in honos Norway and it's such an interesting case with multiple Witnesses
and some really really impressive Landing traces this very interesting
case comes from Norwegian researcher Jorgen granley and was published in the publication UFO
Alejandra it was just after 6:30 p.m. October 25
1977 as two 14-year-old boys Frank s Mont and Johnny myrr who both suffered
from deafness they had exited a bus at National Road 241 outside of honapos and
were walking up the road to the alms school for children with speech and hearing
difficulties now this was a steep road so they had to hike up it and they were just a couple of hundred meters from the
school where the road curved sharply to the right and levels out and this is when they noticed something
strange in the sky it immediately caught their attention way off in the distance
from the forested ridge there was this large glowing object they could see that
it was round it was about 60 ft across they estimate and it hovered sort of
moving back and forth right above the Treetops but as they watched this object
began to slowly float down the slope towards the skull and moved right over
the soccer field there and then it moved almost directly overhead at which point
it became completely still three legs came out of the bottom of the craft and
to their amazement this craft slowly descended into the freshly plowed field
right next to the soccer field and I'll just quote one of the witnesses as he says there it stood on its three legs
there were strange lights all around and the whole craft had a strange greenish glow there were two windows and in one
we could see a figure moving it resembled a human but had no face we still thought the creature was watching
us when the craft began to take off again we we ran up to the school we
didn't dare stay any longer so the object was on the ground
very briefly for only about 10 seconds the two boys immediately ran very
excited up to the janitor and told him what happened the janitor immediately
formed the school Warden a man by the name of martinius clevin and he and
another school official grabbed a powerful flashlight and hiked out to
where the boys said this craft had landed the two witnesses Frank and
Johnny followed but they refused to go all the way they were still a bit shook up but they did point to where they had
seen this craft resting directly on the ground so going to this spot the school
War and the other school official did find three heavy prints on the ground
they said each was about 30 cm long 20 cm wide and 15 cm deep each of them was
equidistant from the other so the school Warden called the
police and representatives of the Norwegian UFO Center who showed up the
very next day and conducted extensive interviews with the witnesses and did a
whole investigation they measured The Landing traces and found out that the distance
between the landing pads was about 21 ft just over 21 ft so they found out
something else interesting they later discovered that residents of several farmhouses in the area had also seen
this strange glowing green object at the same time wasn't clear if they saw it coming in for a landing or taking off
but it was the Talk of the Town everyone was talking about how strange and unusual this glowing green object was
also it turned out that one of the school officials said that he saw this shining object as it took off and left
the area and when the military found out about this cuz they were contacted they
said that they also received a report of a quote weird object this was from a
town nearby called Gardon so police chief oyon Foss was very
impressed and he interviewed the people the witnesses and as he says and I quote
I myself with the help of an interpreter have recorded detailed witness accounts
from the two boys there is no evidence that they are lying something has landed up there on the ridge the regular prince
in the ground also speak for it the imprints have been made by something of great weight it is considered out of the
question that it could have been a helicopter that landed there the place is only about 100 met from the school
and no one heard anything there the very strong Prince also contradict the fact
that it could have been a helicopter how strange is that that a UFO comes
moseying down the hill lands for about 10 seconds and then takes off scaring
the wits out of these two kids but again it seems to be another example of them just kind of saying hi or showing
themselves perhaps one of those kids was a contacte I wonder about that I would
sure love to talk to them today to see if they've had further encounters but I don't know I'm really glad that there
was another witness in the school who saw it as well as of course all the neighboring residents in the area so
quite an impressive multiple witness case and also wow with those Landing traces I mean this is a case that
becomes unden deniable it's super interesting and one of so so many cases
like it I think each one of these cases teaches us a little bit more about
what's going on here all right moving to the next case and this one is really extensive and
quite interesting I call this one aliens inspect Farmhouse I like this case for a number
of reasons this one occurred on August 31st 1978 and in a little town called L doce
this is in Argentina but I like this case because it is of course a multiple witness case
there's in a way some interesting animal reactions or lack thereof
actually uh but not only multiple witness it involves a power failure which appears to be connected to this
sighting and it's quite extensive the UFO is pretty standard in description
but the humanoids they are different and that's putting it lightly but some
really interesting confirmation in this case for sure it was just before 1 p.m.
on August 31st 1978 as Leonor beatric turella Aras was
taking a shower in her home in the small town of lace Argentina which is located
130 M Northwest of neia along Route 86
in Southern buenus Aris Argentina you can see it here it's not a big town
suddenly the power to the house went out now her husband seeing the power go out
he decided to go directly to bed his name is Manuel Aras meanwhile Leonor went to the
kitchen and this is when she noticed a strange light coming from outside and
Illuminating the interior of the house and this was not a normal light it was
very solid looking iridescent and most strangely it appeared to be coming
straight through the walls of the house itself that really quite impressed her
and as Leonor says the glow was hard to describe but its intensity gave me the
sensation of having gone right through my body when I tried to see myself I
couldn't so naturally she looks outside and she could see that the source of the illumination was coming from the right
corner of their Farmhouse and about 100 ft away hovering
over a group of a half dozen small silos was a very large dark oval object and
was swaying back and forth slightly as it hovered in the air Leonor of course
quickly woke up her husband Manuel he came to the window and together they observed it they said this object looked
totally solid it appeared to be about 25 to 30 ft in diameter they could see
Windows all across it sort of squarish Windows separated with struts and as
they watched this object moved away from the house over their Farm Fields about 250 ft away they it was about 50 ft off
the ground and it began to hover over a group of eucalyptus trees about 2500 ft
away so yeah they could clearly see what they estimated there was about 10 rectangular wind Windows along the
central section and these windows were glowing a bright white orange they also could hear that this
object was emitting a loud pulsating buzzing noise which could be easily
heard over a strong wind that was happening at the time they also noticed that the lights of this craft were
pulsating in rhythm with this buzzing noise so after a few minutes of
observing all of this they were amazed to see this object eject two glowing
bulb shaped objects which immediately began to descend and move one behind the
other towards the witnesses these glowing things were just
a few inches above the ground at this point they couldn't see them clearly but
they continued to approach the witnesses at a speed of about 10 to 15 mph and soon revealed themselves to be
dark Silhouettes 3 ft tall vaguely humanoid ined there was a head
and what appeared to be a body and they could see what looked like two glowing red lights where the eyes and face would
be so they just kept coming closer and closer to their house and as the beings
approached a barbed wire fence bordering the property they rose up and over it
easily and descended back just to a few inches above the ground still moving
towards the house it quickly moved to to a shed that was holding various
machinery and vehicles but when they reached the shed they made a 90° turn
disappeared momentarily then reappeared kept moving they avoided a clump of
eucalyptus trees and other obstacles and then slowed down even further as they
came upon another shed which they began to circle around as if they were
inspecting the area so they watched this for quite some time time I mean this was going on and
on and at some point they stepped away from the window just momentarily and
upon return saw that the large object and the beings were both now gone but
this whole event lasted almost an hour later the next day they went out there
to look for evidence but couldn't find anything in terms of footprints or Landing traces they said the encounter
did not affect them physically in any way though Leonor admits that the ordeal
left her very badly emotionally shaken I mean she sought medical help That's How
Deeply it affected her they also noticed something else strange they have a bunch of dogs who are normally quite sensitive
and will bark when anyone or anything approaches the area but they were abnormally quiet so that was
weird now there was a power failure right when this encounter began uh this
power failure affected a pretty wide area which the newspapers blend climed on strong
winds the two witnesses Leonor and Manuel were not planning on going public
but they did tell their neighbors about the experience and this is a small town words spread quickly soon journalists
converged on the area interviewed the witnesses many articles appeared in
newspapers but Manuel quickly regretted going public and said that if it
happened again he would tell nobody Leonor also spoke with reporters
and as she says and I quote now I'm more peaceful I have no doubts about what we
saw and ever since that night I look outside knowing that they are there that
they're near us and want to communicate they have no intentions of attacking us
if they came back today I think I would go outside without any fear whatsoever
now interestingly a few days later the UFO did come back and his Manuel says it
was a craft a module let us say suspended in the air giving off light I
think they always do the same they flood everything with their lights and then take off they do whatever they want and
then leave they did find out that they were not the only witness on the same night
of their encounter the first one their neighbor Lorenzo parachini said that he saw a bright
object hovering over the trees at the moment the blackout occurred so it could be that this UFO is
in some way associated with the blackout but in further and frankly undeniable
confirmation of their experiences there were more than 20 other encounters which
occurred both before and after all through August and September in the surrounding areas a lot of
cases and there's a really interesting end note to this case which is that
another encounter occurred a full 10 years later but only about 75 miles away
from the aras's farm it was one evening in January of 1988 when two witnesses both 18 years
old their names are Leonardo Fuster and his friend Gabriel they were in the Las
Serena District of Mara del Plata and it was 1 a.m. when they saw a light coming
from the peralto Ramos Forest this light was only about 350 ft away
quite close and was making rapid circular and zigzagging movements when
suddenly it struck both these young men with a bright beam of light dazzling
them leaving them temporarily blinded the beam retracted their eyes adjusted
and the witnesses could now see that this light was actually a solid oval object with squarish Port holes and
humanoid forms in the windows they could see a multicolored kind of fog emerge
from the object and this is when they noticed a small being now Gabriel was so
frightened he covered his eyes he was too afraid to look but Leonardo says that he saw an entity and what's
interesting here is he described it in the exact same terms and details that
the aras's did almost exactly he said it was sort of an amorphous
vaguely humanoid looking two foot tall entity with a head and a sort of body
but he couldn't see any arms or legs necessarily but it did have two glowing red eyes very much the same as the other
description so how crazy is that I mean can you imagine looking out of the window of your Farmhouse and watching
these humanoids kind of floating around for nearly an hour that's a long time to
see something so unusual so that makes this case really impressive and when you
add the fact that there was a whole B whole bunch of sightings going on both
before and after the neighbors seeing UFOs as well and then 10 years later
somebody seeing pretty much exactly the same thing just you know a short
distance away certainly a short distance as the UFO flies it's a really
interesting case for sure all right now we move to the next
case I call this one chased by extraterrestrials this is a single
witness case without a whole lot of supporting evidence there is some apparent electromagnetic
disturbances but boy the witness in this case was very traumatically affected by
his encounter as you shall see so there are physiological reactions as well this
one occurred on September 21st 1978 in Kenza Italy and yeah I call it
chased by extraterrestrials the information on this case is somewhat limited but it
originally came from the Italian UFO magazine UFO Rista inform
UF so it was around 7:40 p.m. on September 21st
1978 when a young man now his age is not given but he's variously described as a
young man or a boy he was walking through a construction excavation site
in a fairly urban area of Kenza Italy when suddenly the area around him became
brightly lit he says it was just like daylight in fact it was so bright he was
unable to see the buildings or people around him for a brief moment but looking over at a nearby Hill he says he
saw a colored oval object with a small figure standing directly on top of it
this did not appear to be a human figure but was humanoid he said it was wearing
what looked like a helmet with what looked like antenna on it this frightened the boy he ran away but
tripped and fell and the next thing he knew four little beings came jumping and
bounding in these weird bizarre jerky movements directly towards him this
scared him so bad he fainted in fear when he woke up he found himself now
completely surrounded by four of these little entities he got a very good look
at them he said that they wore blue pants sort of white buttoned up jackets
they had helmets on their heads with antenna a kind of backpack on their backs he saw their hands they did not
look normal so they didn't have fingers but it looked more like Pinchers or claw-like hands it's not clear whether or not these were mittens or something along those lines at any rate each of them he said was about 5T tall and they appeared to be gesturing to each other so he jumped up and tried to attack them
but found he was unable to even touch them and quickly ended up fainting again
when he woke up it was now 8:30 p.m. so almost an hour had gone by the four
little men and the oval object were both gone but he did notice one other thing
the lights at a nearby house had all gone off so this appears to be what we
would call an electromagnetic disturbance in possible relation to this encounter but unfortunately there is no
further information on this case I really feel for the witness in that case cuz I can only imagine what it must be like to suddenly have the area around you blazing with light looking up seeing a UFO seeing a humanoid fainting having them come running after you uh fainting again waking up to see them all around
you and fighting them I mean wow this is quite a dramatic
encounter and yeah some apparent electromagnetic effects as well it is a
briefcase and I do wish there was more followup on it but I certainly think it's an important one and worthy of
being well known and now we move to another case which is super interesting for sure it
is another fairly brief case but it was inves ated by very well-respected and
experienced researchers I call this one an alien in the yard this occurred on
November 24 1988 in a little town called Davin this
is in jamlin Sweden and while it is a single witness case there does appear to be some
corroborating Witnesses so that makes it I think important in terms of lending it
a level of credibility that it might otherwise wise not have but it's also
interesting because the ET is described in doing something pretty unusual I mean
there's some really interesting and unusual aspects to this case this brief but still interesting case comes from respected researchers per person and classus Swan and it involves a man by
the name of run asplund was just past 10 p.m. on November 24 1988
and the main witness run sat at his kitchen table drinking a cup of coffee
when suddenly his dogs began barking as they normally do when a stranger arrives at the same time movement
outside the window caught his attention so looking outside less than 20 ft from
his house he saw a very strange figure he immediately noticed that this figure
was a little shorter than a normal person about 5 ft tall but it was standing with its legs
wide and its arms outstretched from it its body in a weird way and it remained
in one place rocking its body back and forth in a weird fashion but even
Stranger Than That was that it was wearing what looked like a shiny metallic divver suit so run stared in
astonishment at this figure for a full minute and then decided it was wise that he go outside and
investigate so that's what he did he opened the door and instantly this figure just disappeared poof it was
gone now run later discovered that on the same night in the town of hung about
10 mies away a police officer's vehicle was inexplicably stopped as a UFO passed
overhead he heard this though the two investigators of the case were not able to confirm this but in support of ruins experience one year earlier in the winter of 19 1987 his neighbor reported his
observation of a 3 foot tall figure in the same location and as in Ruins experience this
figure just disappeared Into Thin Air I can only imagine what it must be like to
look outside because movement is catching your eye and what do you see a silver suited humanoid right outside
your window I mean it's crazy so many cases like this I'm really glad that the
main witness Rune did find another witness a police officer who apparently
saw a UFO in his area on that same night and experienced a mysterious vehicle
failure so that would qualify as electromagnetic disturbance evidence and
also that his neighbor saw a humanoid as well I mean that also adds another level
of credibility to it it's certainly an interesting case and now we move to the last case in
this episode which is also a really unusual case I really wanted to include
it because the humanoid the description of the humanoid is certainly not standard 
I call this one please tell me
I'm not crazy that is of course a direct quote from the witness and certainly
something I've heard from a number of other Witnesses who would rather kind of think they were crazy than admit that they've actually had encounters with ETS this one occurred sometime in the
summer of 1999 in a rural area of Clarksburg
Massachusetts it is a multiple in his case a very close-up encounter with an
exceedingly strange humanoid this case was reported anonymously to the website
UFO evidence. org so it wasn't professionally investigated but it's
certainly a very interesting firsthand account the witness reported it add age
19 6 and 1/2 years following her experience she was 14 years old at the
time and it was 1:30 a.m. One Night in mid
1999 and she was in a second story bedroom of her parents' home in Suburban
Clarksburg Massachusetts when she suddenly heard a very strange and very loud noise coming
from outside and as she says in her own words I heard a really scary deafening
sound like an amplified bat Screech with a lower frequency the sound was
extremely scary it made three of us my mother my sister and I cry just from
hearing the sound so the witness immediately looked out the window where this sound was
coming from and she saw the source there was a strange creature standing on the
roof of the home looking directly into her second story bedroom window
immediately her mother and sister came running in and they saw it too and I'll
just let the witness describe in her own words what she saw what all three of them saw as the witness
says at first we thought the creature was an owl a screech owl or something
but then we got a closer look and just got scared the being looked very thin
about 3 ft tall small black eyes an open mouth with what looked like rows of
teeth or something in its mouth it had what looked like holes on the front of
its head somewhat on the side the only thing it was moving on its body was its
arms it had two fingers on each hand that's what it looked like and it looked
like it had claws of some sort or fingernails it was white or gray I saw
the creature was standing on its hind legs but it looked like it was supporting itself with one of its arms
that fouring limbs it looked like two legs and two arms and it was scratching at the window it looked like it was
trying to get in the creature appears to have smooth skin no hair its eyes
appeared to be all black with no white and I didn't notice any eyelids or other
features. It was standing about 2 ft away from me right in front of my bedroom
window. Now, it was dark, the lights were out in her bedroom, and the window was somewhat dirty but 
she still got a very good look at it because this thing stayed there for a full 15 minutes if
this was long enough to determine that it wasn't a reflection or a hallucination or anything like this all
three of them saw it now when she first saw it she did quickly move back from 
the window as her mother and sister came running in all of them were understandably shocked they were unable
to understand what they were seeing they did note that there is a swampy area 
behind the house and the witness wondered if perhaps the creature had come from there but she did not know
what it was as she says I never read anything about UFOs except maybe fictional things I was skeptical about the whole alien UFO thing I'm still skeptical I'm not saying it's really alien it could be a genetically engineered monkey or something I think it's possible that the creature we saw could have been manmade or an altered animal could also have been deformed by Nature. I hope what I saw was just my imagination or an animal. I never heard about but unlikely please tell me I'm not crazy. I'm not sure if I was in shock or not and saw something that wasn't real or not. 
I really hope I'm not crazy. This is what I remember. So the thing is she wasn't the only one who saw it. Now,  the witness did admit that she suffers from depression and anxiety. At the time she was just 
starting high school she ended up dropping out and it took her a full 6
and A2 years to report this experience and really the only reason she did was
partly because she and her family started hearing it again what sounded like the same creature in the fields
behind their home and as the witness says in her own words today January 14
2006 I heard the same exact noise but I didn't see anything all the women in the
house including me my grandmother and a child were up it was around the same
time in the morning 1:30 a.m. all I can really say about the feeling is that
it's eerie and scary the sound I'm hearing today is further away it sounds
like it's coming from the field across the street from my house that case is super interesting I can't tell you how many many stories I've heard of people who look out their window and see an ET
looking right back at them assuming that this is in fact an ET. The witness
herself didn't you know insist that this is what she saw. She doesn't know. It's
also interesting that apparently years later this being might still be out
there so that is also a fascinating detail. I'm glad she had other witnesses, otherwise I 
could see why you might think you're losing your mind. When you see a being of that description. So 
unusual, but it's another case that adds to all the others. And shows that this is 
a real thing. I mean, we are being visited by humanoids. There's no doubt about it
you can argue till the cows come home about what they are and where they come from. And what all 
this means, but the fact is people are having these experiences. There's far too many to
ignore, to cover up, to debunk. Something is going on and I think it's pretty clear that a good portion of these at least can be explained as extraterrestrials. I think that is the explanation which best fits the
totality of the evidence. But that's why I'm just presenting these cases on a factual
basis so you can make up your own minds about it. And I really hope that's what
everyone does because ultimately there is a big gap between belief and
knowledge. We all need to search out the truth for ourselves. So that's it for today. I
really want to thank you for watching. I truly appreciate it. Again, it's because of you guys I do this research and I'm putting together these episodes. So, thank you, thank you, thank you for all your support. I really appreciate all your kind comments and the super chat donations. Really, really nice of you guys.
So, thank you again and yeah that's it for now. I'll just close the show like I
always do by saying thank you and keep searching for the truth. It's out there.
Keep asking those hard questions. It's up to us to find out the truth because I 
don't think our governments are going to ever willingly disclose. And be that just keep having
fun. That's why we're here. So, thanks guys. I will see you next time. Bye for now!
