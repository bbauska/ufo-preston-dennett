HOW TO FLY A UFO: AN INCREDIBLE ACCOUNT OF UFO CONTACT
Dec 3, 2021

Summary:
Dec 3, 2021
Many people all across the world are having lifelong contacts with UFOs and extraterrestrials. However, some cases are more extensive than others. One such case comes from a gentleman named Tim. Born in Louisiana, Tim has worked as a police officer, security guard, sports instructor and more. His UFO contacts began around age six with a dramatic UFO sighting in front of his home. Following that, he had a series of sightings, missing time events, face-to-face contact, and onboard UFO encounters.

While Tim's contacts were initially shrouded in missing time (he once was missing for more than an entire day!) -- he began to have dreams and flashbacks of what had happened to him. Some of Tim's experiences are highly unusual and a few might be unique. On one occasion, Tim remembers waking up onboard a UFO, and wandering around until suddenly he came upon a gray alien. Consumed with fear, Tim reached back and punched the gray in the head. At that point, a crowd of ETs converged upon him. On another occasion, he was taken to the control room and was taught by the ETs how to fly the craft. He even has some insights into how the UFO engines actually work. One of his most unusual experiences is being taken to a "waiting room" with other abductees where they are able to levitate at will. These are a just a few of Tim's many encounters.

Tim's story has multiple witnesses and physiological evidence in support of his case. His experiences reveal some unique and startling insights about what it's like to have contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and  welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal  
i call this episode how to fly a ufo this episode  is all about one man's encounters with ufos  
his name is tim he does not want his last name  used he's been having encounters his whole life  
many of them and in this episode i'd like to cover  just some of the major encounters about seven of  
them and some of these encounters are experiences  I really haven't heard before and I think you'll  
find them quite interesting so let's just start  with tim's first encounter which occurred in 1971  
or 72 there abouts he was six or seven years old  at the time he lived in new iberia louisiana and  
tim went outside one evening around dusk to play  in the front yard when a ufo dropped down out of  
the sky and hovered just above the street in his  front yard and i'll let tim describe in his own  
words what he saw because it's quite an unusual  sighting as tim says I was standing at the very  
edge of the driveway and I could hear the tv in  my house and in other people's homes and I saw  
something that looked like not a blimp but a long  cigar shape with little windows on the downside  
of it they were like little square portholes  and you could see light coming from the inside  
through these portholes they were just lined down  the side it had so many in one section and then  
there was a space with none and then there was so  many in another section this thing was at least  
as long as a football field it was just solid it  was barely floating above the road and it was just  
very very slow like one mile per hour moving  forward he first thought it was a train  
but as tim says it wasn't a train because then  I realized it was floating it was above the road  
behind the tree line at the top of the hill  and I couldn't hear a sound from this thing  
maybe a slight hum but that's it it was  floating but it was barely moving forward  
so this object moved forward and started to  disappear from view and then tim did something  
he had never done before he was forbidden to leave  his yard but he wanted to see where this thing was  
going so he actually left the yard and climbed  walked up to the street to watch this thing  
move away and as tim says at this point it started  to rise and go above the tree line it hesitated  
stopped for about 10 seconds and all  of a sudden it just shot off so fast  
that the only way I knew what direction it  went was because it left a streak of light  
at that time the only thing I knew that moved  that fast were jets I always said it jetted  
out of sight now I know a jet can't move that  fast there is nothing that can move that fast
so that was tim's first experience  and it was about 10 years later at age  
15 that he had his second experience and actually  had a whole series of them around that same time  
but his second experience was also very  unusual he was at his step-father's ranch in  
indian bayou louisiana and i'll  just let tim describe what happened  
i remember going to bed that night and the next  thing I remember i'm shivering and i'm cold and it  
feels like i'm wet I opened my eyes and everything  was dark i'm looking down at something shiny and I  
realized it was water but I didn't know where  I was I didn't understand what was happening  
the whole time that i'm standing there I felt like  somebody was watching me I was so scared that I  
was almost like paralyzed but I was too afraid to  move finally he did move he slipped and fell and  
looking around he could see that he was actually  in the cattle field next to his stepfather's house  
and this is where it was strange there were no  footprints the only footprints that he could see  
were the ones from himself he had made a few  steps there was no footprints leading into  
the cattle yard or outside of it and besides  that the gate itself was locked so there was  
no way he could have gotten there unless  he was somehow dropped down from the sky  
and as tim says that scared me so I took off  running I ran through the gate across the front  
yard to the house when I got to the house I went  to the front door it was locked I went around  
the back to the sliding door in front of the  swimming pool and the sliding door was locked tim  
ended up having to go into the shed where he  got a tool and was able to sort of jimmy the  
door open so he was actually locked out of the  house which should be impossible there's no way  
so this is a clear-cut case of missing time I  would say and that was the second experience  
and the third experience came right on the tail of  the second experience and involved a ufo sighting  
and i'll just let tim describe what he  saw he was actually at a with his siblings  
and they were going swimming at the local  watering hole and tim saw this weird looking  
circular cloud it was the only cloud in the sky so  that was unusual and it looked strange and then as  
tim says it was a perfect circle the cloud slowly  dissipated and as tim says now there was a round  
circular disk there I remember looking at it and  I couldn't hear any noise so I sat up and looked  
when I sat up and looked that thing took off I  mean it shot off in the sky so fast he was barely  
able to track it with his eyes and when he finally  saw it again it was way off in the distance and he  
could see it glinting in the sunlight and he's  he says the excitement that you feel when you  
see that the wonder and the awe to see that thing  take off and go across the sky that's thrilling to  
see something like that it's a big rush so that  was his third encounter his siblings didn't see  
it so he didn't tell anybody he had kept all  of his secret all of his experiences secret  
and it was just a short time after  that that tim had his fourth encounter  
and this was very unusual he was in his home  with his siblings three of them and a friend  
so there's five kids in the house and they were  all in the living room dancing along to the radio  
when suddenly there was a loud bang and this big  glowing ball of light came in through the window  
and hovered in front of them and disappeared  as tim says a big electrical ball of energy  
came through the window into our living room  and sat there this bluish silver sparkling orb  
it came through the window and floated right in  front of the stereo it didn't make any sound and  
then all of a sudden it just it just dispersed  right in front of us like it just melted away  
so all the kids saw it it really freaked them  out their first thought was that it must have  
been some sort of a lightning strike they figured  well perhaps lightning had struck the power pole  
in front of their house causing this  ball of energy to come into their home  
and when their parents came home a short  time later they quickly told them what  
happened and the parents took them outside  and pointed out that it was actually a bright  
sunny day there was no storm systems anywhere  near them it could not have been lightning  
and besides the power pole itself was undamaged so  that really puzzled all of them and none of them  
were able to explain it but it was shortly  after this that tim started to remember  
what happened nobody else did none of his siblings  did or his friend but tim had a second version of  
events of what happened when this ball of light  came into the house in tim's second version  
they were all dancing along to the music when  suddenly everyone froze in place and the music  
stopped it was as if they were all like statues  and this completely freaked him out as tim says  
i looked to see why the music stopped and I  remember everything just froze like time stopped  
everybody stopped moving we were all dancing  around and everybody just all of a sudden stopped  
at this point to tim's amazement  three grayish figures started to come  
through the wall and the window of the house as  he says I saw them coming through the walls small  
tiny figures coming through the wall one came  through the side and two came through the window  
and they looked like they  were grey ghosts like a gray   shadowy figure I just remember they were small  and they were a dark grayish color but not black  
it's hard to explain it looked like their  molecular makeup and they themselves were  
vibrating extremely fast and hard and as they came  through the wall they started to re-materialize  
they were out of focus and then they started to  re-materialize and I remember them taking me and  
that's the last thing I remember the next thing I  remember is hearing the boom we hear this boom and  
saw a big flash and the next thing we know this  shiny glowing orb blue and silvery kind of sparkly  
and staticky came through the window I have two  separate memories of the same incident i'm the  
only one who has two separate memories now why do  I have two separate memories of this same incident
so that was tim's fourth encounter and it  was followed right on the heels by another  
encounter tim's fifth encounter which again  occurred at his father's stepfather's ranch  
in indian bayou each morning tim and his little  brother had chores to bail hay and they were  
both sitting on the hay wagon at precisely 6  a.m waiting for their stepfather to come out  
when tim noticed that his little brother  had forgotten his gloves so tim told him   go inside go inside and get your gloves tim's  little brother ran inside to get his gloves  
and the next thing tim knows his brother and his  stepfather come outside and they're really angry  
they're asking him where have you been it's seven  o'clock where were you we have been looking for  
you for an hour tim has no memory of where he was  for an hour as tim says I remember sitting there  
waiting for my stepfather to come out the next  thing I know my stepdad comes out and starts  
fussing with me where have you been it's  almost seven o'clock we're going to be late  
tim told him i've been sitting right here his  stepdad said no you ain't been sitting out here  
i came out here several times looking  for you and I couldn't find you nowhere   we've been looking all over for you where were  you I never got off the wagon tim insisted and  
at that point he felt an intense searing pain on  the back of his leg sort of the hollow of his knee  
and he quickly ran inside and removed his pants  and saw that there was two deep scoop marks  
where the flesh had been cored out of his leg they  thought maybe he had sat on a nail or something  
but his pants weren't torn they even  considered that possibly he had been   bitten by a snake a water moccasin or something  but that didn't make sense either the flesh was  
actually missing there was no hole in his pants  it bled for quite a while but did quickly heal  
up and it was something that they have never been  able to explain so that was his fifth encounter  
and it wasn't long before he had a sixth encounter  his sixth encounter occurred two years later  
he was 17 years old and tim and his friends  decided to go to lake arthur louisiana where  
there was an annual regatta of boats being held  and they were on the beach just laying in the  
sand watching the girls go by they had a few beers  and suddenly the next thing tim knows is it's no  
longer friday afternoon it's now sunday evening  and he's waking up in bed at his cousin's house  
he had lost more than a day all of saturday and  most of sunday and as tim says in his own words  
my friends told me they couldn't find me for a  day on saturday night they found me lying on the  
beach and they couldn't wake me up they brought  me back to the hotel room they thought I was drunk  
when they got up sunday morning they still  couldn't wake me so they put me in the car and   they brought me back home my cousins left me in  the house and they brought me and put me in my bed  
and I woke up later that afternoon   tim was mystified because while he had had  one or two beers he was by no means drunk  
and even if he was his friends should have  been able to find him so that made no sense  
he was missing for an entire day uh as he says I  would have been on the beach I mean where did I go
so this I think is a good indication that these  encounters are by no means psychological that's  
twice now tim was not where he was  supposed to be and people could not  
find him so at this point he's had six  encounters at least four of which involve  
missing time and he started to have dreams  of being on board ufos he was seeing grays  
he was looking out the window you could see the  stars moving by really quickly as these objects  
were darting around real quickly in these darting  patterns and i'll just let him describe another  
dream where he saw a gray face to face as he  says this is tim's dream i'm hiding in the barn  
and I see this creature coming toward me and I  hear the door open and I see this shadow coming in  
and there's this bright light behind it and I can  see it had long skinny legs and long skinny arms  
and then I can see the rest of the body I see  this little tiny creature standing there it looks  
just like an alien with the big black eyes and a  big head and he lifts his hand and points at me
so at this point tim was starting to get a clue   of what was happening to him at that time  there wasn't really much talk of aliens  
so he's pretty much confused by the missing time  incidents and did not know how to categorize them  
but after he started having these dreams he  really began to wonder you know are these   dreams you know what's going on with this  missing time what about this ufo sighting  
and then he had another dream and he got proof  that it was not a dream at all because he had  
physical evidence this is a very unusual encounter  and i'll just let tim describe it in his own words  
as tim says I had what I thought was a dream where  the aliens had taken me up into this spaceship  
and they had restrained me on a table and they  left the room and I got loose somehow they hadn't  
restrained me fully and I got loose and I got up  and I started walking around and when they noticed  
i was walking around well one of them came at me  and I punched him in the head his head was soft  
like a bean bag almost when I punched him in the  head he went down I think it killed him suddenly  
i was fighting several of them I was fighting them  and I was beating them physically hitting them I  
remember one of them jumping towards me and he had  like three four fingers on each hand I remember  
him jumping towards me and then I remember seeing  like seven or eight other ones right behind him  
and all coming at me at the same time and I  remember seeing his eyes his big black eyes  
right in front of my face and I remember going  backwards and that's the last thing I remember  
so tim woke up to find himself in bed and was  wondering if this was a dream and he looked down  
at his arm and he saw that he was wounded he had a  pretty deep scratch on his arm as he says I had a  
cut on my arm like a scratch or a scrape it took  a long time to heal but it did finally heal up
so by this point he was starting to have not  only dreams but physical flashbacks of being on  
board a ufo and he can describe exactly what these  flashbacks were and what the inside of these ufos  
looked like as tim says I can tell you that the  walls on the inside of this thing from what I  
can recall are absolutely smooth like no texture  to it whatsoever like you were rubbing not even  
glass it was smoother than glass not really shiny  just silvery metallic looking it was absolutely  
smooth there were no creases no joints like you  would see in a normal wall like where the walls  
meet together it seemed like it was all  just one piece like it was all one another  
flashback he had is very interesting I don't  think i've ever heard anything quite like this  
it's what tim calls the waiting room and i'll  just let him describe it in his own words as he  
says i'll tell you it's really weird the one thing  on there that I remember was they had a room where  
they put you and there were always several people  in there and it's funny when you're there you  
always know these people humans I don't recall any  aliens being in that room I have recollections of  
being in that room with several people that I knew  very well and it's a room where you can walk on  
the floor or if you wanted to you can just float  in the air you can fly around you can float it's  
like an anti-gravity room but it wasn't because  if you wanted to walk on the floor you could  
just like you normally walked but if you wanted  to float in the air you could if you wanted to  
just fly across the room you could you could stop  in the air turn around and fly back the other way  
i think that what they did is have like a  waiting room and they would put you in there   and it was just so weird and strange and  fun that you didn't think about being on a  
spaceship or having aliens out there you were  just enjoying the fact that you could float  
and fly around what they would do is put  you in there while they were running tests  
on someone else tim remembers being in  this waiting room many times and each  
time he recognizes the people there but afterwards  amnesia kicks in and he does not know who they are  
as he says as soon as it's over you  can't even remember these people's
faces another really strange experience or memory  flashback that tim had was being on board a ufo  
in the control room he was sitting betw or  standing rather between two ET's two greys  
who were learning how to fly the ufo and they  were in fact telling tim how to fly the ufo  
i'll just let tim describe this experience  this memory in his own words as tim says
i'll tell you it's really weird a bunch of ufos   dancing around the sky and playing tag I mean  being inside the ufo when that was going on  
i'm watching through the main view window as  this goes on there were two little aliens little  
grays sitting at the controls controlling this  thing and I understood what they were saying  
i could understand and it to me it's like they  were laughing like they were playing a game it  
was like a training exercise but they were playing  a game and having a good time they were talking  
about that one over there and what that ship did  and what this one did over here and what they  
needed to do to get it was like they were on teams  and they were scoring points the two aliens that  
were flying the ship at the time seemed like they  were young and not very experienced because they  
were debating over what maneuver to do what sector  to go into how to come around on this side whether  
to go up or down and around or whether to go  straight across and then come around on this side
tim got a really good look at the interior of the  ship at this point and i'll just let him describe  
what the inside of a ufo looks like as tim says  the main view window came up and back like it  
was on a slanted wall it's not really a window  it's more like a projected screen on the wall  
that just pops up so they can see everything  that's going on outside they can put that view  
window on any part of the wall and see through any  portion of the wall or they could make the whole   thing transparent where you could see what's going  on outside at one point I remember I was on there  
and we were out in space we were moving away  from the earth and I remember this thing going  
transparent I was looking down and it was like  there was nothing under my feet I felt like I  
was being hung by a thread and just hanging there  and I was out in the middle of space I remember I  
started hyperventilating just freaking out tim  says that the room itself was not very large  
and it was hard for him to tell because  the walls kept turning transparent   as he says I could see the control panel  in the two seats and then sitting there  
and there was also this center portion trying  to think of what they call it on the ship   the control room the pilot room it's a round  room and right in the center there's a big  
column that's maybe 10 to 12 feet in diameter and  it's right in the center of that room now whenever  
this thing goes transparent that thing doesn't  go transparent it stays where you can see it  
but it's on the inside of the ship just  the outer walls of the ufo went transparent  
i was always standing behind them kind  of like I was standing at a station  
sometimes they would show me things to do now  I would never operate anything they would just  
show me how it worked or explain things to me  ask me today I can't tell you anything about it  
actually I couldn't tell you anything about  it as soon as it was over so those are most  
of tim's major encounters he grew up to become a  sheriff's deputy a security officer at a casino  
a sports instructor uh water safety instructor  he continued to see ufos hovering over his house  
and he also started having some other unusual  experiences he would occasionally have out of body  
experiences he had a few ghostly encounters and  he also started developing a real strong interest  
in science in astrophysics in electromagnetics  this is something we do see with contactees and  
certainly turned up in tim's case  and he kind of wonders that this is   a result of his encounters as he says I don't  know if you would call them memories or ideas  
and thoughts about quantum physics and  electromagnetic propulsion type things  
i have no education or training in these types  of fields yet I have an understanding about  
it I can't explain and I have ideas about it I  just recently found out that one of the pictures  
that I would constantly get in my head was a  cylindrical looking metal object with a bunch of  
holes drilled all over the place in it in my mind  that is the outer core the inner core is a solid  
rod of pure magnetism which floats in the center  of the cylindrical metal object and this thing  
spins extremely fast on the inside of a drum and  produces an enormous amount of electricity I can't  
tell you when they showed me or how they explained  it but I know I have these ideas in my head  
and when I hear people talking about  things I think no that's wrong that's   not going to work or they got that wrong or  i'm thinking hey they're on the right track
so tim's story is one of 15 cases I  present in my book on board ufo encounters  
i find tim's case extremely interesting  because his case shows that this is definitely  
not a psychological phenomena if he is  missing while people are looking for him  
he has physical evidence not only for having  disappeared for hours or even a day at a time  
but there was that incident in which he  had uh scoop marks taken out of his leg  
so it's clear this is a physical experience if  he's being locked out of his house and so forth  
it's also interesting because he talks about  the waiting room which is another very unusual  
income type of incident onboard a ufo that  I don't believe i've ever heard before I was  
also intrigued by the fact that he described  these ETs as being like teenage ETs who are  
learning how to fly a ufo makes me wonder about  all the times we see ufos or hear reports of ufos  
dancing around in the sky moving at right angles  or even chasing cars down the street maybe this is  
because they are teenage aliens another intriguing  aspect of tim's encounter is when he was able to  
break free from paralysis while  apparently being physically examined   and he attacked the grays and actually punch them  in the face I have several cases like this this  
is precisely what travis walton also reported  and used similar terms to what tim describes  
so these are all details that I think lend a  certain level of corroboration to his experience  
it's a very interesting case and that's why  I wanted to present it here in this episode  
i hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you  very much for watching I really appreciate it  
and until next time keep searching  for the truth and keep having fun
