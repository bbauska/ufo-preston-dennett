EXTRATERRESTRIAL MINERS
Sep 19, 2020

Summary:
Sep 19, 2020
UFOs are being seen all over our planet. But there is one specific type of location that is 
attracting large numbers of UFOs: mines! UFOs are targeting our mines. Gold mines, silver mines, 
iron mines, copper mines, titanium mines, uranium mines and more: all are being visited by UFOs. 

UFOs are not only hovering over mines, they are also landing. Humanoids are being seen. In some 
cases, the mines are being physically affected. Photographs have been taken. Some mines have been 
targeted over and over again. Cases come from across the United States, Canada, Central and South 
America, Europe, Russia, Africa, Australia and more.

This video presents more than 50 cases involving extraterrestrials miners. These include close 
encounters of the first, second and third kinds. Clearly, something very profound is happening 
here!

These cases have much to teach us about these strange visitors to our planet. For those interested 
in learning more about these extraordinary encounters, check out the book, "Not from Here: Volume 
One."

hello everyone my name is preston dennett  and today's topic is extraterrestrial miners  
these are cases in which ufos have hovered over  mines not only hovered actually but landed and  
some type cases involve humanoids a number  of these mines have been visited repeatedly  
some of these mines are being physically affected  so this involves cases of the first second and  
third kind by the heineck system photographs  have been taken on a number of occasions so  
these are really impressive cases they've been  occurring all over the world for more than   70 years and i've been looking into it for a while  and uh just it's getting incredibly complicated  
so this is what the topic is about today cases of  ufos showing interest in our minds i found about  
30 cases involving simple sightings i'll start  with those and then move on to the cases involving  
what i would call close encounters of the  second kind where they affect the environment   move on to cases involving mines that have been  visited repeatedly and finally we'll cover the  
humanoid cases so starting with sightings yeah  they've occurred all across the united states  
here's a case from texas this is the luminant  liberty lignite mine in tatum texas lignite is  
brown coal this occurred on august 22nd 2019 and  comes from the files of mufon and i'll just read  
you the report directly from the witness this  is the witness talking i work at a lignite mine  
in east texas and i was working the night  shift when i saw several lights fly down  
hover and appear to inspect our dragline equipment  the lights moved back and forth hovered and  
ejected smaller lights the lights appeared around  5 24 am in tatum texas over the luminant liberty  
mine i've worked out here at various mines for  over 20 years and i've never seen anything like it  
another case that occurred in texas occurred in  an area known as van horn this was on june 9th  
1970 when a group of kids saw a cornucopia  shaped object landed in the area of the mines  
near their home and it stayed there  for just a little while when it lifted   up and kind of disappeared by blending into  the sky but it wasn't long after that a second  
object appeared this one was rectangular and a  bright rectangular light came real low flashed  
and then lifted up and disappeared so what's  interesting about this case is this area of van  
horn texas it is very rich in a wide variety  of minerals it includes over a hundred mines  
and some of the minerals and metals  being mined out of this area include mica  
talc soapstone copper manganese lead uranium  zinc asbestos fluorite gypsum anhydrite gold  
and barium yeah well over a hundred mines all  kinds of minerals it's no wonder the ufos are  
showing an interest in this area here's a very  interesting case which comes from the files  
of mufon this occurred on july 13th 2013 and  involves a ufo photograph and i will just read  
the witness's testimony directly and i'm  quoting i was going on a camp retreat and  
we had never been to colorado as we went through  this little town called frisco i decided to take  
pictures of the old gold mine that was there  we were on our bus still and as i was going  
through my pictures i noticed that there was  this black disk looking object as i zoomed  
in i couldn't believe my eyes i knew it was a  ufo and being that it appeared out of nowhere  
the photos i had taken seconds before that one  had no black discs in them just that very one  
another mind that's generating a lot of recent  interest because of ufo activity is the board  
camp crystal mine in board camp arkansas the  owners orville and cheryl murphy have finally  
decided to go public because they've had so  many strange events which include rocks that  
seem to levitate and move by themselves weird  flashes of light in a number of ufo sightings  
mufon did actually do some research into this  area as well as josh gates of expedition unknown  
who also did some research and apparently saw  ufo mufon's researcher chase kolowski was there  
and uh he's the owners orville and cheryl murphy  are now going public and uh trying to figure out  
the mystery of why ufos are so attracted to  this crystal mine uh it's just another case  
i think where ufos are showing an interest in  metals here's another case from uh upstate new  
york an abandoned mine in harriman state park in  mawa new jersey new york the border right there  
it occurred at 10 30 p.m on march 6 2011. this is  a report from the national ufo reporting center a  
gentleman wrote in to report his sighting he had  while he was on a night hike he was climbing up  
this trail and saw a very bright light he reached  the top of the trail and saw this bright disc  
about 35 yards away hovering over what appeared  to be a mine shaft and apparently actually took  
some film of this i don't have the film but i  do have his eyewitness testimony which i'd like   to read to you here as i saw it i yelled out loud  the disc took off instantly from the ground with  
no noise more rapid than anything i have ever  seen it was the size of a blackhawk helicopter  
and as it pushed off the ground it displaced  all of the air in the area making a soft wind  
when i went to the spot about 35 yards away it  was hovering over what i thought was an abandoned  
mine shaft you can't even see the bottom of  this shaft and it's on old government land  
i have absolutely perfect video and sound of this  what do i do is the government going to come after  
me for sending it to you i need you to see this so  you can tell me what the hell i should do so many  
cases coming in from all over the world another  area that's known for uh ufo activity in upstate  
new york does have a lot of mines there was a huge  wave of sightings there in the early and mid to  
1980s this is up in pine bush new york it's a very  well known hot spot around the 1980s ellen crystal  
joined up with harry liebelson of omni magazine  and they started doing ufo stakeouts in this area  
ellen crystal ended up writing a book about  her experiences called silent invasion and  
she thinks it has something to do with the minds  in this area because she learned from residents  
that these ufos were hovering over the areas  where there was a lot of mines and they could hear  
strange drilling noises uh on occasion during  her stakeouts ellen crystal saw bright arc  
lights coming from the ground or even felt strange  blasts of air coming from below from the ground  
and she learned that this is one of  a few locations where there are some  
very rare elements including beryllium  zirconium and titanium all of which are  
ores that are very useful for the production of  nuclear power and used in nuclear engineering  
so she speculates that perhaps ets are  mining this area and using it to build  
alien bases and she's not the only one philip  imbragno he was probably the chief investigator  
of the hudson valley ufo sightings he wrote a  book about it as well along with j helen heineck  
and he also discovered a definite link between ufo  activity and mines he was contacted by a cia agent  
who told him that ets have bases in orange putnam  and ulster counties he was intrigued by a letter  
in june 1984 in the new york post which read as  follows and i'm quoting why are people seeing all  
these ufos all of a sudden in the hudson river  valley area the answer is simple there seems  
to be some kind of underground activity in the  brewster area in the old abandoned iron ore mines  
some years ago the government went out of its way  to purchase the land that the mines are located on  
and the people who live in the area including  myself have seen military vehicles entering  
the dirt roads they never come out phillip  and brogno did some research and learned  
that in fact the government had purchased land  around brewster and putnam valley in lake carmel  
and regarding this whole area the pine bush  area he also speculates the ets are mining  
rare minerals and building bases wouldn't surprise  me a bit considering the amount of activity that's  
going on across the world there are a couple of  cases from new mexico which is also very rich  
in various elements one case occurred on  april 22 1958 at the ambrosia lake uranium  
mines uh these involve two guards regarding the  slag heap there their names are tom reader and  
james turbin their security guards at the ambrosia  lake uranium area and uh while on guard on april  
22 1958 they observed this very bright light  land on the mesa next to them uh it was some  
distance away but stayed there for several  hours and finally at one point rose up into   the air at which point it became brighter and  brighter until it was too bright to look at  
and then it's zipped away changing in color  from uh white to red initially and then  
blue as it moved off so they reported this to  their boss and uh he described he believed them  
and describes them as being definitely  highly trained and reliable observers  
another case from new mexico occurred at  the chino copper mine this is in bayard  
new mexico it occurred not too long ago april  7 2014 the witness is himself a mine employee  
and he gave a very lucid account so i'll just  read to you his report this is the witness talking  
i work at the chino copper mine in bayard new  mexico we work half the month night shifts  
and in my 10 years there i have never seen  anything like this at 7 30 pm on april 7 2014  
me and my supervisor were in the pit and noticed  a bright star-like object appear to the north  
it was moving at a rate of speed that is not  humanly possible it traveled almost directly   from north to south and covered the whole  sky from the north horizon to south horizon  
in about seven seconds it was about the height  that jets and commercial planes fly the object was  
super bright like a star but a clear bright color  about the twice the bright brightness of mars  
i got out of my pickup truck to listen  as it passed over us and it made no sound   we also worked night shift last night i  was working in the office when i heard  
over the radio one of the employees called his  supervisor to see if he was seeing what he was  
he said just east of the mine around an area  known as the kneeling nun there were three  
star-like objects that were hovering and circled  each other then merged and shot off he did not  
know of the sighting we had on the seventh  and he described the same night what we saw  
he witnessed it around 5 45 a.m around dawn i do  not know if there is a pattern of dusk and dawn  
but these lights are really scaring me a little  either the government has developed technology  
way ahead of their time or we are really not alone  i would love for there to be an investigation  
so yeah that's directly from the mine employee uh  himself involving two sightings one after another  
he's now gotten a camera just  in case there's another sighting  
another case from the united  states occurred at the old raul   copper mine this is at 9 30 am a morning  daylight sighting august 16 1965 or thereabouts  
this is in shady cove oregon two of the miners  saw looking up saw what they described as a  
glassy white object it was just hovering in place  they first thought it might be a balloon until  
they could see it was actually rotating in place  when suddenly it started wobbling and darting  
back and forth uh for about two minutes  and then it moved off to the west  
uh they thought it was gone but a short time later  a plane was flying over the mine and this object  
reappeared and it would follow the plane for a  little bit and it started doing flips and turning  
up and down and all these maneuvers and then shot  straight off i don't think it's coincidence that  
there's so many objects hovering over mines here's  another case this occurred on october 6 2009 at  
ruth nevada copper mines and i'll just read to you  from the witnesses testimony here's the witness  
talking i am a truck driver at an open pit copper  mine in ruth nevada just east of ellie nevada  
on the night of october 6 at about 9 pm i was  traveling east onto one of the dumps where we are  
dumping waste rock and i was looking directly  east over the shell creek range of the mountains  
as i looked i saw what appeared to be a very  bright star just a few degrees above the horizon  
then the star blossomed up into a sparkling  orange sphere and brightened considerably  
the object was still stationary at this point and  then disappeared he radioed to other people at the  
mine and they saw it too and as the witness says  it was by far the strangest thing i've ever seen  
and it left me with questions i will never be able  to answer to put it in one word wow i was not the  
only witness on my crew an equipment operator who  was working on the dump saw the phenomenon twice  
and another truck driver also witnessed the event  once so apparently this is something that's being  
repeated at the same time another case and  a really incredible case really is from the  
bingham copper mines which this case is from mufon  it occurred on july 10th 2005 at bingham utah  
and yeah the bingham copper mines are one of the  largest man-made excavations in the entire world  
so this is definitely an important event and  i'll just read to you the eyewitness testimony  
we were approaching the bingham copperine pit and  were on a limited access road it was mid-morning  
and we were driving quite slow with the windows  down and the radio off as we started toward the  
top of the hill a large dark shadow came over the  mountain to the west of us and covered the entire  
car we initially thought it was a cloud but the  shade was much darker than what cloud can provide  
and the edges were crisp and defined in a circle  there was no noise and when and when we looked  
out the windows up into the sky the disk shot  over the car as it startled and zipped across  
the valley to hover above the city below  it stayed motionless for about 15 seconds  
and then just disappeared we didn't see it move  off or anything it just wasn't there anymore  
so there's case after case of this all across  the united states here's one from carbondale  
pennsylvania involving an anthracite coal mine  an abandoned strip mine this is on may 24 1977  
at near scott township pennsylvania  carbondale this report does come from   mufon and the witness reported seeing this  object move over his home toward carbondale  
and he later heard rumors that this object had  actually crashed into a water-filled strip mine  
and that red and green lights  were seen flashing in the water   apparently the military showed up cordoned off  the area and a flatbed truck was later seen  
carrying something hidden under a tarp it was oval  in shape and this truck was traveling down route  
6. of course the implication is that a ufo  was recovered from this strip mine the next  
news report that came out said that these lights  that were seen were actually a railroad lantern  
but the witness who reported this case to  mufon uh says that's not a good explanation   because railroad lanterns don't flash and this  object was reported being a flashing light  
so yeah this is kind of a third hand case   without any real investigation to it of a possible  crash retrieval but it's definitely fitting the  
pattern of what we're seeing in these cases  where ufos come over mines abandoned or not  
they are very interested and it's not only in the  u.s it's all across the world here's a bunch of  
cases from various places other than the united  states one occurred in hermosillo mexico hermosio  
this is at the white mine ranch it occurred  on march 22 1959 this was just before midnight  
when engineer francisco cantu castro and his  fellow co-workers marcelino soares and francisco  
gutierrez were driving down the road approaching  the mine when the road was blocked by a blue light  
covering very close to the ground it was a very  brilliant bright blue light blocking the road  
there were naturally very reluctant to go forward  too afraid to approach until finally this thing  
took off and uh one of the witnesses  marcelino soares reported it to authorities  
in this case it eventually made it to the files  of apro the aerial phenomena research organization  
run by jim and coral lorenzen number of  cases from south america one occurred in  
chile in april 2013 in north chile at the  cola huawei copper mine this involved a  
metallic looking saucer which was hovering at  very low altitude over the mine four technicians  
viewed this one of them had a camera and was  able to capture a number of pictures of this  
object they described it as a flattened disc  brilliant in color about 30 feet wide they  
were interviewed by a local ufo group but they did  not want to go public because they feared ridicule  
but it's a good case in one of several in  which photographs were taken of these objects   hovering over mines here's a very interesting  case which occurred in the peruvian andes at  
the catalina huanka silver lead mine this  was in 1961 near the rio pampamarka area  
at opongo in the peruvian andes again  this is the catalina huanka silver mine  
and i'll just tell you the report  directly from the witness or part of it  
this is the witness talking i was a geologist 30  years old at the time working for marcona mining  
company of san francisco at its iron mine on the  coast of peru 250 miles south of lima a peruvian  
friend manuel montiel was also working at the  mine in the electrical department he asked me to  
accompany him on a weekend visit to a small but  rich lead silver mine located high in the andes  
the owner gustavo hernandez wanted the opinion  of a geologist as to the visibility and potential  
of the mine which he had opened only two years  earlier so the geologist joined his friend manuel  
uh montiel and went up to this mine it was a  long winding road very treacherous that soon  
became nothing more than a trail and he got there  and this is when he learned this incredible story  
about this ufo that had appeared there only a  short time earlier a few weeks earlier a typical  
classic flying saucer appeared over the mine  and just parked stock still for about 15 minutes  
at which point it started moving around and it  maneuvered around the mine for the entire day this  
is a classic flying saucer it was glowing round  with portholes and it was viewed by more than 70  
people 70. that's how long it stayed and what's  even more amazing was what happened the next day  
a truck filled with ore was leaving the mine and  they reported that this object followed them for  
quote several hours as it drove the long road  down the away from the mine so it followed them  
basically all the way down the mountain an amazing  case uh here's another case which occurred in new  
caledonia i didn't even know where new caledonia  was turns out it's east of australia north of  
new zealand out there in the south pacific and uh  it's not a large area it's kind of a small island  
part of france i believe but it does have  a number of mines including a gypsum mine  
and one evening in january 1954 the caretaker at  the gypsum mine saw this brilliant luminous yellow  
light very large hovering at a low level over the  mine hovered for a full 20 minutes before suddenly  
zipping away but as was hovering over the mine  it was pulsating now what's interesting about  
this case is he's not the only witness there was  people in two separate locations nearby who also  
saw this activity uh there's a case which comes  from india which has a number of mines this case  
involves the bihar mica mine it occurred on  september 15 1954 in han boon bihar india the  
manager of the might of the mica mine his name is  mr chatterjee he and hundreds of other witnesses  
watched this saucer-shaped object descend to  an altitude of only 500 feet ufo hovered for  
just not very long then soared upwards at great  speed at which point it caused a big gust of wind  
and uh what's interesting about this case is more  than 800 people saw it and the speculation is  
that this object was mostly interested in the mine  which has supplied uh beryllium for the u.s atomic  
energy commission so we know ufos are  all about atomics and they're definitely  
hovering over mines which are have minerals  used in the production of atomic materials  
uh many cases here's a couple from uh  canada this this next case occurred on  
april 12 1953 at the frood strobe mine  this is a location in coniston in sudbury  
ontario canada this area is very very active  with ufo activity as we'll see later on when we  
get to the more extensive cases this is a simple  sighting over the freud strobe 9. i was involved  
shining cigar-shaped object six miners  observed this object hovering over the  
mine for about 20 minutes i also drove through  the town of coniston which is a smelter town and  
saw it to the west this object changed shape and  color and earlier in february there was had been  
wave sightings in which people in coniston the  town itself saw this silvery torpedo shaped object  
moving over the town so yeah this is a mining town  and a mine that's are both receiving sightings  
another area in canada which has had  a really dramatic sighting over a mine  
is fort william ontario canada this is at the  steep rock iron mine this occurred on march 28  
1953 when about 20 workers were in the mine pit  way down deep at the bottom when this 50 to 80  
foot round white object swooped down to within 250  feet over the ore pile so mind you this thing has  
to actually dive down into the ore pit itself and  sven newton one of the drill foreman at the mine  
along with a number of the other people said he  thought it was going to crash that's how low this   thing was and as it's flying out it sends off  this brilliant flash of light some of the miners  
thought it actually exploded because if you saw  what looked like fragments of metal falling to the   ground and uh this thing just darts off zips away  very quickly and was seen in the area by other  
people as far away as lakehead terrace bay and  atacocan so it was a pretty widespread sighting  
but definitely targeted the mind allegedly  there's another case that occurred the divike  
diamond mines not too sure about the source on  this one it does involve a photograph in which  
taken by the miner allegedly this occurred on  september 2012 when mine workers observed this  
large lenticular shaped object sending down beams  of light and one of the workers took this picture  
uh i am unsure about the source wasn't really able  to track it down but for what it's worth the davik  
diamond mine is a very large mine it's produced  one of the largest diamonds in north america and  
uh wouldn't surprise me a bit if it's attracting  ufo activity because we see ufos hovering over  
all different kinds of minds there's a number of  cases which occurred in africa here's a case that  
generated a lot of interest with the us government  this occurred on 1952 at the belgian congo mines  
when this ufo was hovering at very low level  over these uranium mines and i was staying there  
for about 15 minutes just doing these elegant  curves and changing their positions until finally  
the witness commander pierre who's a  pilot decides he's going to scramble his  
fighter plane and chase after these things which  he does and he's unable to get to them because  
they easily evade him each time he gets close they  drop down to about 60 feet above treetop level  
and they're moving at least 800 miles per hour he  estimates uh this case is very interesting because  
we now have documents from the cia released  through the freedom of information act that prove  
that this event in fact happened and that the cia  themselves considered this witness very reliable  
remember this is at a time early  1950s when our government is   basically covering this subject up very actively  another case which occurred in africa occurred in  
kitway north rhodesia in july 21st 1957 now known  as zimbabwe this involves the kitway copper mine  
a bunch of copper miners at this mine saw this  number of saucers darting around so fast they  
had like tails of a plasma coming off of  them and they believed that these objects  
were visitors from outer space spying on them  because they were interested in the uranium  
that's being mined from this area another  case occurred one month later august 1957  
at the chabane area of rhodesia same area of south  africa at the saudi gold mine and this involved a  
very dramatic sighting which a large group of  workers became terrified when this very bright  
flaming object came swooping down hovering over  the mine illuminating everything in sight all  
the mine workers hid in the engine room some of  them were screaming god has come they were so  
frightened and it's a very dramatic case involving  a very large number of witnesses and that's what  
we're seeing in a number of these nine cases  very low level sightings very widely viewed
here's another uh bunch of cases from australia   probably probably one of the most famous is the  para burdew iron mine sightings this is a small  
mining town of about 2 500 residents in the  pilbara region of western australia north of perth  
and uh about 950 miles northeast of perth  this case comes from researcher uh ellis  
taylor who had been receiving multiple accounts  of ufos hovering over the para burdew iron mine  
and one of the best cases that he references  occurred on august 30th 2006 involving a family  
rob and jules are the couple and their children  all observed this flashing light they watched  
it move over the town kind of lazily and then  starts moving up radio mountain where the para  
para burdu mountain is located finally reaches  the top where the mine is and just hovers there  
uh it's just this bright flashing light and he  actually photographed this object as it hovered  
there for about 10 minutes and finally it turned  res red and it moves straight upwards until it's a  
tiny red dot and disappears into outer space so  rob's neighbor dave who is also there turns to  
everyone and says i think we've just been visited  by aliens so yeah there was a lot of witnesses  
as ellis taylor says they are a tight-knit  community born from their isolation where   get-togethers over a cold beer or ten and a barbie  are everyday occurrences they are good people  
honest and down-to-earth they don't waste their  words and if they say they saw something they did  
uh yeah the witnesses rob and jules they say and  i'm quoting this experience for us was the most  
awesome thing we have ever seen in our lives as  we do believe we are not alone so that's just one  
australia case here's another australia  case december 8 1979 at the seduna open  
cut mine this was reported in the herald sun  in melro melbourne australia uh in december  
1970 occurred on december 8th at mikathara which  is about 120 miles south east and 500 miles  
north of perth the camps supervisor mr murphy and  several other mine workers saw this oval shaped  
white orange object hovering over the mine this  was at like 3 a.m it hovered there for about two  
hours the night shift uh guard saw it  first and he started waking everyone else  
up so they could see this thing and it stayed  there for a very long time it was making a very  
loud hissing noise stayed for two hours and and  at one point went from the north end of the mine  
to the south end of the mine as if examining it  and finally took off uh as mr murphy the mine  
uh supervisor says i don't  believe in little green men   but he had to admit that something perhaps  from outer space was watching them work
a real recent case from australia occurred on  july 28 2019 not that long ago at the mine site at  
middle mount queensland australia now what's  interesting about this case is there were  
photos taken this case was investigated  by brad morris and keith basterfield  
prominent researchers involved a bunch  of workers who were working at this mine  
on july 28th they saw this object it was early  morning it was a white gray object come swooping  
very low over the mine mound and uh the next  day same witnesses saw this object return  
uh and it was a much more dramatic encounter at  some point it landed at a distant location took  
off again was darting around the sky was changing  shape and hovering in place it changed from a  
pyramid to a triangle to a disc and uh stayed  there for 30 minutes long enough for them to take  
some videotape of this object or photographs so  it's one of many cases in which these objects  
land they hover very low and photographs are taken  but there these are basically close encounters  
of the first kind uh i'm going to move on now to  an even more interesting type of cases the close  
encounters of the second kind i love these cases  because they actually affect the minds themselves  
this case comes from scott corrales and  occurred at the gual cameo gold mines  
at san juan province of argentina this is an open  pit heap leech mine the case occurred on december  
20th 2008 when 20 mine workers were on their  break and had walked away from the mine and were  
about to start their break when this object showed  up over the mine was one of them was actually able  
to take a photograph of it uh meanwhile it hovers  over the mine itself for a bunch of other workers  
about 25 other workers saw it it was very low  and it makes this very loud buzzing noise this  
point all of the machinery fails on the mine  all work all drilling comes to a complete stop  
as this object hovers there not for long and  shortly after hovering there it takes off at which  
point all the electricity and all the machinery  worked fine again so it was a very dramatic case  
photographed witnessed by dozens of mine workers  it of course made the local newspapers who  
tried to debunk it in fact the newspapers called  it quote a service balloon and i won't even joke  
that it was a garbage bag flying aloft in search  of fame it's absurd because this thing actually  
caused the mind to uh fail all the electricity  and it's not the only case where this has happened  
but here's one of my favorite cases it's really  quite bizarre this occurred at the spring creek  
mine this is at spring creek ridge in the selway  wilderness outside of twin falls idaho this case  
was investigated by jim and coral lorenzen and  other researchers the main witness is buzz montag  
who finally contacted the jim and coral lorenzen  because he had seen ufos over this area a number  
of times throughout the early 1960s but the real  incident he contacted them about occurred in 1965  
when buzz montag and his friend william andrews  were out there hunting and had been camping on  
a bluff that overlooks the spring creek  mine and they were surprised to see this  
bright silver object hovering at a very low level  over the ore dump and uh this is you know not  
valuable or this this is waste matter often called  tailings in which all the useful ore has already  
been extracted so it's strange that the ufo is  hovering over you know this waste dump and they  
got out their hunting rifles which have a 10 power  telescope and looked close up at these things and  
were able to see that these objects had little  arms and were scooping up the waste matter the  
the rock and uh looking up in the sky  they saw there was three other objects  
a total of four of these little saucer shaped  objects and one very large cigar shaped object  
with portholes um all of these were perfectly  silent the large object was much higher about  
thousand feet high which really isn't very  high at all uh and uh the smaller objects were  
at ground level and i'll just read the win the  report from jim carl lorenzon protruding from  
the top of the objects were four hose-like devices  which were inserted into the slag piles and were  
moving around after a period of time one by one  the objects elevated and ascended into the air  
at this time the large object was spotted it had  four depressions on its underside when the small  
objects reached the object they fitted themselves  into the depressions after which there was no  
indication that there had been a depression there  to begin with another after another short period  
of time the objects detached themselves from the  cigar-shaped craft and returned to the slag heap  
so these two guys buzz montag and william  andrews watched this for over an hour as  
these four smaller objects made four separate  trips down to this slag heap pulling debris  
out of it and returning it to the  mother ship at one point all four  
objects rose upward and attached themselves  to those little depressions in the craft  
and uh this object moved off it's a very strange  case but uh really quite incredible that they were  
interested in this slag heap but they do seem  to be very interested in it for whatever reason  
so this next series of encounters is  definitely the most complicated of them all  
involves a number of objects affecting this  this area in a number of different ways  
this is basically the sudbury sudbury  area of ontario canada over a number of  
different mines but particularly the algoma  nordic mine and this nickel smelting plant  
in sudbury ontario and it's really incredible how  many cases there are and how they've affected this  
area there's a case where it's followed a  train cases where it's hovering over slag heaps  
or it's investigating the smoke stacks where it's  hovering over the water tanks where it's draining  
electricity from power lines it's causing  power failures so it's a hugely complicated  
series of encounters and i'm going to do my  best to relate them here first case i'd like to  
talk about comes from don donald campbell and he  relates this incident which a ufo hovered over the  
inco mines and over the slag heaps for a  period of hours so here here's him talking  
okay this is don campbell 488 telstar avenue  sudbury ontario moon moonglow subdivision  
i was a welder for 25 years at inco and  the last 10 years before i took my pension  
in 85 i was a a foreman supervisor  teacher and finally a head foreman  
for the copper cliff welding  shop with 72 people under me   i'm going to relate a few stories and things that  have personally happened to me over the years  
especially in 1967 we were at work this day on day  shift and i was uh tacking jobs in the plate shop  
when one of the welders happened to be  standing up near the back door having a smoke   and noticed this beautiful silver disc it  apparently was about five six miles high  
over the tracks where we dump our slag and do  everybody's attention hey guys come on out and  
see this beautiful silver looking thing  and we're all pointing up and at it and   even then some people said gee i wonder is  it a floating balloon or anything uh one of  
the welders was smart enough to uh tack a little  stick on the back door which is permanently held  
open for trains going in and out bringing plates  he nailed the stick lies a gun sight and aimed it  
over as you would a gun barrel and aimed over the  edge of the door of the door right at the silver  
balloon or what we thought we may be a silver  balloon this was at 10 o'clock in the morning  
people were talking about it uh alberto size who  was the foreman in the shop at that time phoned in  
the station told them about this and they said yes  we've got many calls about it people in sudbury  
were looking up we were looking up this went on  until approximately two o'clock in the afternoon  
but before two o'clock i was so excited owning a  telescope at home i decided to get sick early and  
headed for my home by the time i got home and  looked up in the direction that the balloon  
should have been it was no longer there not  for one minute did i think it was a balloon   it was a beautiful silver desk shining in the  sun it hadn't moved in the four hour period  
so we knew darn well that a balloon would  slowly drift but this thing had stayed there   it was gone so the next day i related this to my  fellow welders and plate workers out there and  
they said oh yeah it was there and it just zoomed  away and it was gone in a matter of two seconds  
a couple of blinks of the eye and it was gone the  follow-up in the sudbury star the following day  
uh many many phone calls to stations and the  sudbury star turns out that the air force says  
all this was was a weather balloon uh taken up  information of uh ionosphere and stratosphere  
conditions and that nothing to worry about it's  not a ufo and that it just drifted away in its own  
and when questioned uh they said well how come it  stayed in the same place for four hours overclock  
coppercliff they said it was a weather  inversion and it was held there by a   pocket of air that was not moving and then some  people said well how come they could fly away  
all of a sudden they had no answer for that  here's another case related by donald campbell  
involving over 50 mine employees who saw an  object hovering over the inco nickel mines  
another incident my brother-in-law art seguin  who's worked up algo nordic for 20-some  
years up in elliot lake mine practically  from the day it opened he's retired now  
i didn't personally see this myself but uh  there was about 50 mine workers going in  
through the gates early in the morning i guess  they go on shift like we do at coppercliff   probably 7 15 7 30 to be changed in their  workflows to go down the the mine for eight  
o'clock they have to be on duty by eight and  uh lo and behold this is a beautiful clear  
summer morning and everybody's looking up over  the parking lot right near the gate sergeants at   the gate looking at the passes same ways we do a  copper cliff and the ufo is sitting there no sound  
beautiful silver craft the sun bouncing off its  body early in the morning uh quite a sight and uh  
art related this to me and uh there's at least  50 people and uh this hit the elliott lake press  
locally about all the men seeing it at the  mine at this time their local little paper   but it didn't get into toronto or globe mail  or you know our local papers a big write-up  
about ellie lake miners uh seeing this but it  was the talk of elliott lake for quite a while  
here's another case involving an inco nickel mine  employee who has had a very scary encounter in  
which he was beamed by a ufo again this incident  is related by donald campbell who has become  
something of a you know a whistleblower with all  of this he was initially ridiculed by the way   people called him ufo don but soon he had revenge  because all these incidents started happening so  
here's donald describing this amazing incident  an incident that happened in inco i believe was  
in 1969 while i was still in the welding shop  i was on four to twelve and as a lot of sample  
house people doing the concentrator and sample  house from the converter aisle grinding samples  
of nikolaur after its cool down to see what the  waste content is and jimmy shrigley who was a  
acetylene welder in the welding shop had a son i  don't recall his first name but he was a shriggly  
working in the sample house and shrigely before  he left inco was the full 65 years old and his  
son was about 38 to 40 when this incident  happened he was going from the concentrator  
back to the sample house which is just above  around one or two converter up in the next level  
and as he's carrying the pails he looks up he  feels this funny feeling and he looks up and he  
feels his heat beaming down and then a light came  on the light came right down on him he looked up  
i think he almost pooped his drawers right there  because there was about a 50-foot circle he was so  
frightened by this thing being right over him  at the time he dropped both the sample pails   which is about 20 pounds in each hand and run  like mad to the sample house and told the guys  
come out here come out here look at this they come  out just in time to see the back end of the ufo  
slowly drift back up into the clouds this is what  frightened him so much and the story went all over   the plant the next morning on day shift that's  wrigley's son and he talked to related to his dad  
jimmy the next evening was over at his dad's house  and said how he's seen the ufo how frightened he   was because he could feel the warmth off of it to  eat on his arm hair standing up in the back of his  
neck the nape of his neck was that close and this  thing turning a light on right when he was between  
the concentrator and the sample house dropped the  pails and run and then of course he had to get a   sample pails back as soon as the thing left went  back over picked up the sample bales carried them  
in and continued his ship this was getting near  the end of the ship summertime again 10 30 when   it's fairly dark by 10 30 in the summer nights and  that was one of the true stories by shrigley hi so  
the granddaddy of all these cases uh is probably  the one that occurred in august 1967. this one was  
witnessed by donald campbell himself and this  occurred over the inco smelting plant at the  
at the copper cliff mines in sudbury  and in this case a ufo hovered over the  
smelter plant itself and caused a power  outage and uh i'll just let donald  
campbell describe in his own words what he saw  one of the good stories i like to always tell is  
in august of 67 on 4-12 i was a three-shift  welder and 4-12 was our favorite shifter watching  
and it was 10 20 10 30 and i was in the welding  shop this night and i was welding and we have  
an inner plant phone which is 515 the plate  shop was 505 and my friend jimmy thomasini  
was ringing the phone off the wall i guess there  was five or six of us back at the plate shop   no i was in the welding shop he was in the plate  shop and he said dawn he said did you look out the  
front and see this ufo and i said what do you mean  he says well they did a double circle around the  
stack he said i'm sure it's a ufo a plane would  never come in the grounds be against the law  
and he says you better run to the front  door just leave the phone off the hook   and see if you can see it i run to the  front door which is a couple hundred feet  
and i looked and i looked over toward the dry just  in time to see this thing hovering over near the  
drive so i run back to the phone i said jimmy i'm  going to run right over the plate shop right now  
where you are he said oh good good he says it's  definitely ufo because i've lost track of it and   where he was in a plate shop he could no longer  see it from where i could see it out the back door  
so i run across the road put my helmet everything  down my gear got over the plate shop where there  
was at least eight welders he was one of  them that was working overtime that night   and plus our own gang of ten welders and plus  eight plate workers because uh some converter  
hoods and some other things had collapsed a number  one and two converter and they had emergency jobs   rebuilding to get these converters back into  operation so this is quite all interesting  
so we all run out the back everybody's all excited  hey come on welders maniego and dubois and kelly  
and everybody that was in there were calling  them all come on to the back door and come and   see what's over the dry so we angle our lookout  we go in the back tracks we're all out the back  
door some guys are smoking some aren't we're all  looking and it's just hovering there over the dry  
and this got us quite excited then it started  to approach our shop so we're waiting and it's   coming down coming down it's not it barely moving  like not even 30 miles an hour maybe 10 15 just  
coming down we say my god this thing is so low you  know where i think it's going to get caught in the  
hydro alliance because we got all these electric  poles up for the electric trains and we think and  
we say well it isn't that low it must be 10 feet  it must be missing the post by 10 feet well you   wouldn't have an airplane flying over darkness at  10 15 feet over hydro poles with high current line  
it's coming is coming and it's off to our left and  it's a gorgeous sight here's a little red light on  
the front and a green light you know and the red  light is pulsating the green light is on steady  
we can't tell the back from the front of  this graph because we can see it's an oval   shape we're not directly underneath it but we're  almost at an angle so we watch it as it goes by  
now it's facing directly east as it passes our  eyesight from the back door and the cil building   is about 800 900 feet past the plate shaw we  glance over straight east we say oh my god  
it's going to bump right into the building all of  us were all watching this with great delight and   it eases right up just beautiful banks just  as if it's got its radar set for buildings  
and obtrusion it just lifts automatically just  clears the cil stainless steel stacks for vents  
it just goes right over them at a beautiful  angle and then veers up veers up and veers up   i personally did not see it do the double take  around the stack this was earlier in the evening  
and i didn't see it go over the concentrator  because we can't see the concentrator   the concentrator apparently when it went over  it there was about 15 witnesses out there that  
were out in the backyard scraping down old denver  cell parts and everything we found this out the  
next day they had witnessed it going over there  number three power station is about a thousand  
feet before number one drive where i changed  every day and when it went over the power station  
all the knives broke open and these were the  main feed lines from number one power station  
to the concentrator the concentrator kicked out  at 10 30 that night causing a a gigantic flood  
all blacked out we we didn't  know at that time it happened   so anyway sergeant wayman meanwhile after seeing  all this and the things flying away had an amazing  
you know just a blip light going up up up up  and then it became a star and then it was gone  
i'm on the phone phoning the 969 the radar telling  just what's happened and then they start asking  
questions what condition is the sky or did you  see this by yourself sir i said oh no i said  
there's 18 or 20 of us here at least that we're  all watching it at the same time we're all trades   people that impressed him meanwhile sergeant  weyman he's passed away since then he died about  
eight years nine years later than this date he  come running over all of the breath and he said  
hey you guys did you see he says i was standing  at his security eh he's standing at the front  
gate he said did you see that thing come over he  says i was at the front gate of the dry he says  
just standing there and having a smoke he said big  as life he said i never believed in these things  
he said a big circle thing he says in a big bottom  he says what a fantastic sight and not even a hum  
out of it you know just like a ghost moving  along and he says not only that he says but   i seen it when it went over the the transformer  house and he said all these flashes has all the  
knives kicked out he said i seen that too he  says they must be going to have trouble tonight   someplace he didn't know that it was connected to  the concentrator so we're all talking to sergeant  
weyman and i said i phoned the radar base he was  excited we're excited none of us did anything the  
rest of the night except sit down and talk about  what we had just witnessed and the radar base of  
course they got in touch with me the following  day they phoned me at home knowing that i made   a few other reports from before this time and this  same year they knew who don campbell was so uh to  
make a long story short the next day we found out  there was about 15 witnesses at the concentrator  
uh the people near the power station you're not  allowed to go in except the 2p operators they  
didn't see the knives actually opening up but the  two electricians on duty had to unlock the gates  
go in there and push one knife in at a time  while and by walkie-talkies to the remote  
station and say okay powers on number one powers  on number two you don't push all the knives in too  
rapidly because you can get a burnout and again  there's the next day that the official reason  
or the reason that uh the power went out in the  log book of the superintendent at that time was  
logged in their book you know because they have to  report this to new york when they have a shutdown   it costs twenty thirty thousand dollars in lost  production it has to be noted in a log book the  
superintendent he was not on duty that night but  when he came on duty the next day he's a steady  
day man he was told all the circumstances so the  official reason for the power outage at 10 30 that  
evening for 15 minutes before they got everything  kicked back in and the loss of production was an  
unidentified flying object over the copper cliff  complex doing a double circle around the middle  
stack then over the concentrator and then over  the dry and then over the back of the plate shop  
with eighteen twenty witnesses over the shield  building disappearing in a northeasterly direction  
and as told by don campbell who had  phoned the radar and they confirmed that   it sped away at twenty two thousand miles an  hour from a cruising speed of ten fifteen miles  
an hour in the yard which was just poking  and then when it angled up and left it just   became a star and then if you looked up that's  what you think it was just a little white star  
this is one of my favorite stories because so many  people looked at it and the welders that used to  
kid me and say there's ufo dawn the guy that goes  out at night with different people and sees ufos  
and when they all seen it and spread it to all the  other 50 60 70 welders there was no more kidding  
around about ufo dawn anymore because there was 18  20 people all with eyes like me looking up at an  
object with a red and green light and witnessing  for their first time in their life a genuine ufo  
not a piper cub or a cessna flying 10-15 feet over  the company property at 10 30 at night and causing  
an outage of electrical power and everything  and documented by the superintendent stuck  
to my opinion they were studying our nickel  veins and our water routes and everything in   in this district so the case of uh donald campbell  is truly amazing and it's not the only one there  
are many others here's another case in which a  ufo hovered over an inco train causing physical  
effects it seemed again once to be interested in  the dump conductor and engineer aboard an ingo  
slide train i don't remember the number they were  on four to twelve shift it was their last pouring  
at quarter to eleven pm and uh they parked the  engine took the pantograph down as they always  
do put the emergency lock check their air pressure  200 pounds and everybody's ready to start pouring  
and they felt the conductor had his arm on the  sill like they always do on the right hand side   going up felt the heat on the upper part of his  arm and there's a little window sill just above  
to keep the rain off their head when they  stick he stuck his head a little further   he looked up and there was a circular  craft which he said was 40 to 50 feet  
roughly in diameter and it didn't have  the light on right when he looked at it   it was just off and then all of a sudden the beam  of light came on and then this really created some  
excitement right away he said this conductor look  out the window look out the window on your side   the doctor looked out the left-hand side of the  window and says oh my god it's a ufo it's ufo  
and he said the excitement went on for about five  minutes the three guys are putting the pails of   water to get the crust out of the slag bowls they  all stopped work everybody they had a better view  
than the engineers they're all looking up ufo ufo  ufo and there's one italian guy up there a real  
accent and he was yelling too ufo ufo ufo it's  like spaghetti spaghetti you know it was cute and  
everybody's excited and it stayed there about five  minutes and nobody everybody just quit working   nobody's dumping the engines nothing then the ufo  just raised above gentle as that had to come down  
turned off its beam of light flew away but this  was about a five minute sighting from three at   the slag dumb plus the engineer and the conductor  when they got down to showers that night it was  
about five after twelve when everybody checks in  when they walk from their station to the dry and   that was a talk and number one drive that night  was conductor engineer and three slag men also  
ufo over the dump it was quite some excitement  and this is nice to see witnesses you know that  
they're not imagining things when a ufo comes out  of the sky and you feel the heat on your arm it's   parked above before you even start to pour the  slag out you know there's something wrong when  
you feel the heat coming from above instead of  from down below so that was an exciting night   for them i only wish that i was there but all we  heard was in the dry it was the last run probably  
probably about 10 45 because that's the time they  park it takes a half hour to dump the 11 15 on  
their way down they'd be in the main lower yard  at 11 30 because that's the schedule they were on   so that's another uf incident at inco  approximately 19 69 and a half maybe 70.  
and yet another case in which a ufo however  almost seemed to land right on top of the  
inco water tanks the water tanks that uh fed  to the uh mine so this ufos are apparently  
interested in all aspects of this mine area okay  here's another one of the stories that i wasn't  
directly involved with but uh two men that check  all the yards and uh well they're actually uh what  
they're supposed to do is check the water tank  for water levels uh pressures uh they have a water  
tank out there it's about 100 feet in diameter was  built by subcontractors in the early 60s supplies  
water drinking water and plant water to all the  plant and it has a few lights shining up on the  
side of it it's kind of lit up it's on the side  of a high hill up there anyway this particular  
night these two guys are sitting out on the roof  having their lunch at three in the morning legal   time three to three thirty and they're eating  their lunch and they see this light coming in  
from a distance it's coming closer and closer and  they say gee it looks like a helicopter coming   and there's a red light and there's a white light  on it and they think they're not thinking too much  
of it but it's when it gets closer they realize  that it's silent and it ends up parked right over  
the water tank which is about 100 feet  diameter and they said the edges of this craft   were as white from edge to edge and they thought  it was actually so low at one time point in time  
they actually thought it landed on the tank but  it wasn't there was a space in between and it's  
sitting there and they've practically choking on  their food they can hardly swallow they're saying   you see what i'm seeing they said yeah boy oh boy  so they watched it for about five six minutes and  
not too much comments are just watching this  craft and then the red light came on and the   white blinking light blinked blink blink and it  just raised off and in about 10 seconds it just  
often went into the outer space and they knew then  at that point then they said we've just seen a ufo  
they were all excited and told everybody about the  next day and they had a buddy who was out a little  
bit of a party he had a few beers other lively and  he's coming home at three o'clock in the morning  
and when they went to relate this story to their  buddy in sudbury a few days later he says well i   know what you guys are talking about he said  i was coming home about three o'clock in the  
morning he said i did have a couple under my belt  he says but i pulled my car right over he says   right off the road right onto the gravel because  he said i seen this light coming out of the sky  
and he said i could see the water tank from the  road he says which is only about 1500 feet in and   he said i could see this thing coming right down  he said my god is this a helicopter going to land  
on top of the water tank at the iron ore plant so  he says i watch with great interest and he says  
watch it watch it he said there was really  nothing more to see except that this thing   was just sitting there with this you know with  the light shining on you could see that it's  
not a helicopter that looked round disc shape uh  the lights aren't that powerful but you can see  
that it wasn't an airplane he said i watched it  the whole five six minutes like you guys told me  
he said and i seen it lift off and i seen  in the red light come on the white light   come on and i seen it disappear and then he  said i traced it and as it went up into the  
heavens it just became a little white star he  said it just blended in with the rest of the   skyscape so he said i know you guys aren't  lying to me he says i seen it that night  
too you hadn't been coming home at three in  the morning he said i thought am i really   seeing what i'm seeing he says because i was at  a party he says and i was quite interested in it  
uh and there was yet another case in which a  ufo hub drained the power lines this is in 1968.  
most of these cases were 6768 around this time  and in this case the ufo over the power lines  
and drain them causing a power outage here's one  case the main witness is jim betts this occurred  
on october 23rd 1975 in which a ufo was hovering  over the nearby murray mein slag heap in sudbury  
and i'll just let him describe  what he saw in his own words
okay hi my name is jimbet and i was  transferred to levac from 1958 from sudbury
and as the years went by in 1972 i transferred  to mccready west mine close to the back  
and i've been working on there for about  15 20 years on heavy machinery equipment
so to make a little shorter  one night october 23rd 1973
approximately about 12 20. i was working  four to twelve shift on that week
and that particular night when i was driving home
close to sudbury at mary mine on   the levac old highway when i when i  was driving past the railroad track
on my left hand side i seen something quite  uh quite bright which i thought was the moon
and then i got thinking there for a few seconds  and i was still driving on the highway slowing  
down and i looked on my right hand side and i  could see the moon there and that that night  
was very clear so i drove slowly underneath  the old underpass close the carpet leaf
and when i passed that i could still see the  moon on my right hand side and i and i was  
slowly slowly driving down again   towards the old slide dump and there was a  conveyor belt that was going across the highway at  
that time and there was a kind of a little stretch  there pretty straight there i would say i guess  
and then i noticed that that light where i  had seen just a few minutes before it was  
it was uh kind of a standing stop there and and  it was read above and ariel and i think it could  
have been uh it must have been a radio uh lantern  or something it was quite high anyway and i could  
see that object there's oh maybe i don't know  from guessing roughly maybe 1500 feet above it  
and it was it was it was still i had my  window down and i couldn't hear any noise  
and as i was driving going  towards it for a little wait  
it kind of uh it kinda it was i had a feeling  it was kind of draining my mind or something
and uh i got even closer and  then there was a right hand turn   on that road at that time going by  the old belton hotel we used to call  
and as i was getting close to the belton hotel  this object here just took after within seconds  
with a flash there and it seemed to me that  it disappeared on its way down with elm street  
in other words uh to explain  more a little closer was   somewhere from my middle hall coming down  to the old ymca there coming down elm street  
so i stopped at the corner there  uh just close to my mail house  
and to see where i stopped there for a minute  or two just to see if i could see anything else  
and then all of a sudden it came right back  just like a flash and it came right above my  
car there while i'd say maybe uh roughly maybe i  don't know maybe thousand feet high or somewhere  
and it stopped again just a couple  blocks passed to my middle hotel  
yeah my middle holiday anyway and  then i stayed there for another   couple of minutes to watch it which at  that time it was on my left hand side
and then it could have been there maybe 15  20 seconds it was very short time that it   was there and then it disappeared again  the same way as it did the first time  
so many cases are just so many cases over this  area here's another one it occurred on october 12  
1996 when two boys saw a ufo right again once  again over the inco smokestacks and this is  
something they seem to be very interested another  case which occurred around the same time uh also  
same area this comes from a witness by the name  of fl and i'll just quote the witness directly  
as he says it was either four or five years ago  i'd have to check back we do keep records of when  
i was working they had me put on a graveyard shift  for the winter and i was patrolling the tailings  
area and as i was coming back i had just shut  off a spotlight because i was checking a pipeline  
and i happened to glance up into the sky and i  noticed a light a bright light come basically   straight down i saw it go through the clouds  the clouds were sort of a wispy reddish color  
because it was 4 10 in the morning it went down  and went back behind the light tower where the old  
fruit mine is or the murray mine is and went back  down in behind the hills and that's what i saw  
there was no trail of any kind no vapor trail no  light no nothing i was really shocked to see it  
there are case after case of this i honestly  can't cover them all there was one on march 26   1970 where an object apparently made the news  as it hovered over the ficunis and levac mines  
and uh many other cases here's just one more  in which a witness by the name of ted williams  
uh also saw this cigar-shaped object  hovering over the inco smokestacks in 1990  
okay last wednesday at about uh 17 minutes to 12  noon not not a cloud in the sky or anything like  
that and i've seen this little cigar thing going  by no noise no i'm in garcia by the way no sound  
no smoke nothing eh and it went by i watched it  for about 12 minutes okay so i seen this thing  
uh like a little cigar thing bright white very  bright and i followed it all the way i lost it in  
the eco smoke stock okay so i turned around it was  two of my buddies there with me and uh we turned  
around after i lost it in the smoke that was  the only smoke in the sky it was a clear day and  
uh i go back and i turn around and i'm talking to  them a little bit and i'm saying well what what do  
you guys think that was and everything you know  and we were talking about trying to discuss what   it could have possibly been i turn around it's  back in the same spot where i've seen it not  
more than like maybe three minutes after i lost it  and followed the same pattern again the same path  
right away watch it for another 10 12 minutes and  uh nobody else in surgery reported seeing this  
i was scared i didn't know what to do i  didn't want to say anything i watched the news   because i figured maybe somebody else would say  something and nobody did yeah you could probably  
write a book about what happened and it's probably  still happening at inco very very interesting  
but again not the only area which is having all  kinds of crazy activity one ufo mine encounter  
that generated a lot of attention occurred at the  carnes city uranium mined this was in the summer  
of 1971 and the main witness is michael harvey  he's a conoco oil employee he and six others were  
working the night shift at this 85 acre open pit  uranium mine west of karn city they were using a  
let's see a caterpillar tractor a caterpillar 657b  earth mover and had reached a depth of about 210  
feet when suddenly as harvey says the entire area  became lit up as if it was daylight there was this  
bright bright light hovering very low level over  the mine it was far too bright to even look at  
and i'll just quote uh don or i'm sorry  i'll just quote michael harvey here directly  
this is michael harvey talking the light was so  bright that i had to squint because it hurt my  
eyes i remember hearing a high-pitched hissing  noise and the hair on my arms stood on end i  
was so scared i fell to the ground and started  praying uh this is what all the mineworkers did  
everyone was just froze until the light finally  dimmed enough where they could actually see it  
and as michael harvey says and again i'm quoting  what i saw amazed me the object was round and  
the bright light was coming from the center of  the bottom of the ufo around the perimeter of  
the craft were hundreds of pen light size  light beams that alternated in all colors  
of the spectrum i was crying and shaking and so on  so was everyone else uh the next day they michael  
harvey and the other miners talked about the ufo  to the next shift who ridiculed them mercilessly  
but harvey and the other mine workers got the  last laughed and they were when they were able  
to prove how this incident actually happened  as michael harvey says and again i'm quoting  
there is a vein of uranium ore that runs from  george west texas to almost texarkana texas  
when determining where to place a mine  the following steps are accomplished   one a geologist with a geiger counter flies  over the area and finds the highest one a  
geologist with a geiger counter flies over the  area and finds the highest radiation reading  
two drilling trucks are sent out and core samples  are drilled to determine the highest concentration  
of uranium ore these core samples are drilled  in a grid pattern and every core sample is given  
a tracking number and logged in showing the  concentration and amount of uranium present  
three the open pit mine is then laid out according  to these core samples when this incident happened  
we were about two feet away from a layer of hard  rock called the tap rock that lied directly on top  
of the uranium ore the uranium ore varied in depth  from 6 to 18 inches and had about the same color  
as low-grade coal two days after this incident  the tap rock was removed to expose the uranium ore  
we were astounded to find that all the uranium  ore was now a chalky white substance that had no  
radioactivity at all there was a 250 foot diameter  circle of this chalky material in the center of  
the pit outside the circle the uranium ore  was still as potent as before the incident  
core samples don't lie this chalky material was  a uranium before the incident many a night i have  
laid in my bed thinking about what happened i  think the ufo needed the uranium for some reason  
and i have to agree they're definitely hovering  over uranium mines quite a bit this is the only   case where apparently these things that we know of  have taken the uranium or drained it of its power  
many many cases so now i want to move on to  another type of case and these are cases in  
which mines have been visited repeatedly there's  at least four or five of these types of cases  
four or five mines that have been repeated  visibly i mentioned most of them have but there   are these four or five we know of one is the  kennecott strip copper mine one of the world's  
largest open excavations this case comes  from mufon it occurred on january 18 1975  
at salt lake city utah this comes from a  patient at shriner's hospital and i'll just  
read his testimony which he submitted to mufon
i was 15 years old when this incident happened  i was in a ward that had a panoramic view of the  
entire valley my childhood dream was to become  a pilot and i loved watching airplanes coming  
and going from the salt lake city international  airport at night i was watching the airplanes  
at the airport on a clear night i would guess  around 10 pm at night the airport was maybe 8  
miles from the hospital about another 15 miles  to the southwest of the airport is the large  
kennecott strip copper mine i began to notice  these round orange objects that seemed to be  
hovering over near the mine given the distance of  about 25 miles from the hospital these lights had  
to be extremely bright the number kept changing  from just one or two to as many as six or seven  
other kids on my side of the ward also  started watching them after i pointed them out   i also called to a nurse's aide  to come and look at the lights  
this went on for around 15 to 20 minutes the  lights would appear somewhat slowly they just  
didn't flash on and they disappeared in the same  way i know these were not airplanes or helicopters  
gradually the number of lights diminished  to one or two and then there was nothing   after a few minutes of not seeing any lights  everyone lost interest and started going to  
sleep i closely watched for another 30  minutes without seeing anything else  
this incident has been in the back of my mind  all these years i often wonder if anyone else  
near kennecott mine saw the lights if you have  any information from this time period regarding  
these lights or orbs i would like to know so  yeah this comes from a 17 year old teenage boy  
who saw this with a bunch of other  people including at least one adult   uh for some time of these objects over the  kennecott mine he reported to mufon he later  
did become a commercial pilot as he had dreamed  being and that's when he reported it to mufan  
there were no other witnesses to  this incident however 10 years later   another witness did report seeing ufos over the  same mine over the kanekat strip coppermind and  
this report was actually made to the national  ufo reporting center and i'd like to read you  
the report from the witness himself again this  is the witness talking mid to late summer 1985  
walking south from my house with a friend to  his house we noticed a green light coming from   the west mountains directly over kennecott copper  mine heading east my friend and i noticed it and  
stopped where we were and watched it come toward  us i never heard a sound coming from the craft  
until it was almost directly above us the only  sound i heard was a kind of buzzing or rumbling  
and you could almost feel it going right through  you we both agreed it was probably somewhere   between 50 500 to 1000 feet high i remember was  hard to gauge how high because of its cement size  
we also guessed it to be about a thousand  feet long and approximately 250 to   300 feet across there were three distinct  separate cigar-shaped craft not visibly or  
structurally joined but moved as one each one was  separated from the other by about 25 to a 50-foot  
space we lived in the flight path to salt lake  international airport so i've seen planes come  
fairly low but i've never seen anything  close to this size in the sky even down low  
the witness says these objects were a green  blue in color and eventually disappeared over   the wasatch mountains uh shortly after this  incident his friend came running over and  
reported that he also saw this  this whole sighting as well   and not only that shortly after that the police  came up and were driving through the area and  
stopped the boys and asked them if they had seen  any ufo activity recently the boys reported their   sighting the policeman reported that yeah he had  received several reports of objects in this area
another mine that has been visited repeatedly  is the auganico cobalt mine first cases occurred  
in 1954 or so but there was an interesting  prelude to all this one of the mine workers  
who worked there dan helens before he started  or when he started working there he received  
a warning from a friend who warned him that  uh ufos saucers as he called him were bound to  
arrive he was going to see ufos because they had  an affinity with the cobalt found in this area and  
this turned out to be very prophetic because it  wasn't long after that there were in fact a number   of sightings over this mine and the first occurred  on december 26 1954 the day after christmas when  
willie saint jean who was a hoist man at the mine  said he saw this very bright object hovering over  
the mine it was a bright disk and it sent down  this silver blue cone of light he was in his car  
or actually was outside at the time he ran for  the safety of his car because he was afraid this   thing was coming to get him it was only 150  feet overhead very very bright finally he was  
when it stayed there he called the local newspaper  reporter john hunt and said and i'm quoting here  
john for god's sake get out here there's a flying  saucer overhead spilling light all over the place  
i've got to get out of here before it gets me so  uh john hunt uh lives about three miles away he  
hops in his car drives fast as he ever has over  to this area and doesn't see it at first because  
this object was moving around at this point but it  wasn't long before this thing comes swooping down  
and he sees it too it comes very low it  goes high again um and then came very low uh  
willie's uh willie st jean was telling jon  hunt that this thing came down solo it scared  
the blazes out of him at some point uh john hunt  takes out his flashlight and signals it the object  
moves off again so the reporter calls some other  people who are in the town tells them about this  
this news is spreading out through town and  it's not long before other people arrive  
at this point john hunt says it looks like it's  gone but no they climb a ladder and see that   there are now these lights are hovering  on the lake itself on the nearby lake  
so this is a long drawn out sighting that was seen  by a lot of people over the agonico cobalt mine  
and it wasn't long before there was another  sighting in fact just two weeks later there   was a very dramatic sighting on january  7th 1955 this was in the evening again  
and this time there was the witness was john  hunt again and uh he there was another witness  
as well a truck driver al jennings and a third  witness ray johnson who was a mechanic at the  
mine and all three of them saw this bright white  disc hovering for two hours over the mine at  
at this lake the lake is called turnis carning  lake and uh the rcaf sent over a jet and  
apparently in search of this thing and  they were later contacted about it but they   made no comment they preferred not to talk about  it so this this agonico mine has been repeatedly  
visited a third event occurred the very next day  at 4 30 a.m when a miner by the name of maurice  
parent and his family saw another ufo hovering  over the neighborhood house outside they looked  
and they saw two extremely bright objects this  would be you know they lived in the mining town  
next to this area and these objects started around  for two hours and then took off straight upwards  
so yeah an enormous number of cases at certain  mines but probably the most visited area in terms  
of ufos and mines is what's going on in arizona  it's just incredible uh arizona is the leading  
producer in the united states of copper there  are at least a dozen cases of ufos hovering over  
a wide variety of mines in this pretty closely  defined area in arizona which is you know pima  
uh cliffton morenci uh tucson these areas  uh one case comes from warren arizona  
occurred on march 6 1980 when a disk was seen  hovering over the mine tailings in warren arizona  
eyewitnesses watched this disc turn on edge and  fly to the south in total it was in view for about  
eight minutes uh here's a case which occurred very  close to the green valley copper mines this is in  
green valley arizona occurred on august 20th  2018 the witnesses are a lady and her husband  
they were driving near their home that there are  some abandoned mines near their home where there   are a bunch of mine tailings which have created  you know small hills which with little plateaus  
on top so they're driving near their home they see  this glowing red cylinder it's and it's hovering  
over the mine tailings behind their homes and the  moment she sees this thing and thinks oh that's   unusual it starts darting back and forth getting  first closer to them and then farther away and  
it's appearing and disappearing and suddenly it  zooms right in front of them about 50 feet away in  
front of them she could see the shape of it now is  cylindrical very tall and thin almost like a tower  
and uh very bright it looked like a neon light  she said and felt almost alive very impressed  
impressed her her husband was very  skeptical didn't want to talk about it  
but even he said wow and she ended  up reporting this case to mufon   and it's one of many many cases in this arizona  area here's a case which occurred at a tucson  
gold mine it says this is on december 28 2001 and  the witness's name is barry and this is what barry  
says and i'm quoting i'm a regular guy i'm  a four-year veteran of the army i have an  
associate's degree in structural engineering and  an advanced degree in heavy equipment operation  
so yeah maybe not a regular guy he's  pretty well educated there so a good a   good witness and he was running the night shift  at this tucson gold mine using a track hoe  
to feed an incinerator and he had a co-worker  who was also you know pretty accomplished he  
was a retired special forces major and suddenly  this immense craft it looked uh as barry says  
almost a mile wide it was huge it had weird  lights all over it and appears over the mine  
and the cloud ceiling was about 9 500  feet so they know it was lower than that  
so it had to be absolutely huge and as  barry says and i'm again quoting barry  
my esteemed colleague got a deathly white sheen  to his face and would not come out of his personal  
jeep he was scared and he was babbling like a  child me i turned the track hoe to face it and  
kept flicking my daylighters in the hope they  could come and see who was behind those lights  
i felt at ease no panic you see i felt as  these were my friends like we had met before  
so this object stayed for quite a while it would  appear and disappear but never too far from the  
gold mine it was hovering over as uh barry says  and uh finally just moved off the next night two  
military attack cobra helicopters hovered over  his work site and just stayed there for a very  
long time and weren't moving away and got to  be really annoying so barry finally just turned  
on the floodlights on these guys at which  point the helicopters circled the site  
and headed directly towards the gold mine where  the ufo had been hovering and barry was really  
impressed by this sighting and apparently so was  his co-worker because two years later barry's  
co-worker quit and made it clear that he never  wanted to talk about this incident ever again  
and to not contact him about it but barry couldn't  get the incident out of his mind and eventually  
reported it to the national ufo reporting center  many cases in arizona here's one which took place  
at the open pit copper mine in silver bell arizona  this is a very large copper mine this occurred  
on june 14th 1953 and it was around sundown  when a group of rodeo cowboys saw this huge  
glowing object spherical and shape hovering over  the open pit mine and they thought it might be a  
balloon except they decided no it's not because  it wasn't moving at all and as they looked at it  
it actually appeared to be aluminum in  texture and it was about a hundred feet wide  
and then it moved over to the copper butte and  hovered over that and finally it darted a waste  
very quickly turning a deep blue green wasn't  over yet this object stops over elroy the town  
of elroy and at this point it resumes its  original metallic aluminum-like appearance  
and they got some binoculars out and observed  this thing they couldn't see any real detail  
uh other than it was a aluminum sphere and  suddenly this thing it didn't move away as  
far as they could tell it just winked out here's  a case which took place on the evening of june 3rd  
1964 in copper mine this is in page arizona at  the zantelli western mining company how this  
happened was mine foreman edward coyle sees this  reddish glowing egg-shaped object about 500 maybe  
a thousand feet over the mine he watched it as it  moved off to the northwest he decided to notify  
the owners of the mine who were pat and june  patterson they owned the mine and the copper mine  
trading post on the navajo reservation and the  sighting wasn't over yet later that night frank  
howard was the night watchman at the mine also  saw a ufo probably the same mine it was this time  
slightly off to the south of the mine hovering  there in place apparently watching the mine
one mine has been repeatedly visited is the pima  copper mine there are at least three cases in  
this area one occurred just after midnight  on july 22nd 1971 when an anonymous witness  
saw quote a flat disc with a tear-drop shaped tail  and it was glowing bluish glowing light all around  
it and it was moving about 45 miles per hour not  that fast over the waist dumps of the pima mine  
this is about 30 miles south of tucson this crop  craft rocks back and forth it was clearly under  
intelligent control it was darting at  right ankle angles and then zipped away  
and uh only a few days earlier the witness  had seen ufos in the same area but this is  
the really close-up signing right over the  mine and he definitely believes they're coming   for the mine itself but as he says there are  several very high voltage high power lines  
supplying power to the mine plus a continual  thermal updraft from the open pit copper mine
another case occurred just let's see nine years  later in november of 1980 the witnesses in this  
case is george parks who works the night shift  at the bhp copper mines in san manuel arizona  
and on this evening of july 22nd 1971 he's driving  home he's just left work and he's as he says and  
i'm quoting now coming around the bend at oracle  junction i saw a metallic craft hovering not  
far from the road i saw seven windows behind  every window stood a figure an instant later  
it flew off so this is the first of what will turn  out to be actually many humanoid cases and uh this  
may sound incredible but it turns out this uh  witness george parks is a very good witness  
he had been in the military for more than 20 years  he's never seen anything like this following this  
incident he actually joined mufon and became a  field investigator and it wasn't long after that   he became the pima county section director for  mufon and later actually became the arizona state  
director for mufon and as he says as george  park says i'm still looking for answers
here's a weird case which occurred apparently  over pima this is on august 29 2017. a man  
was actually in a jet at 35 000 feet  he was flying from san diego california  
to atlanta georgia and looking down could see  this enormous open pit copper mine in pima  
arizona he recognized it but what really impressed  him was what appeared to be a disc a metallic disc  
and i'll just quote the witness here as  he says i noticed a disc at low altitude  
near the mine it was a saucer-shaped disk  it stood out in the terrain hovering yeah  
a weird case but it doesn't surprise me because  again these mines are being repeatedly visited  
and here's another mine the lavender pit copper  mine it's huge and this has at least two cases  
one occurred on june 27 1947 this is about one  week before the roswell ufo crash it's a great  
case uh the witness the main witness is john a  petch he's an electrician employed at the phelps  
dodge copper mines in bisbee arizona uh he and two  other workers at the mine saw this silver mirror  
disc shaped object it was totally silent it  was wobbling and it moved overhead and it  
moved right overhead and to where another group  of miners saw it about a mile and a half away  
three other mine employees including john rylance  an electrician as well as iw maxwell and milton  
luna saw this object move lower and lower until it  actually landed on a little hill on the mine which  
they had nicknamed tin town vernon c mcminn he  was the gang boss for this group of electricians  
who observed the object and this sighting got  out to reporters and he told reporters that  
several other miners also saw the same object  and that they were all reliable witnesses  
turns out they weren't the only witnesses  there was another person major george b wilcox  
who was in the army at this time he observed eight  or nine disc shaped objects moving at very low  
elevation approaching the bisbee area at the time  of this mine encounter so they moved in single  
file evenly spaced in sort of a dipping rocking  motion so they were clearly on a mission over  
these uh mines in bisbee and in 1980 they returned  for a repeat visit this is many decades later  
the witness is again an excellent witness he is a  former rocket scientist who worked as a telemetry  
collector and analyst for the nsa national  security agency he says he was at a gas station  
next to the lavender pit copper mine in bisbee  arizona when he saw a metallic oblate spheroid  
object about 100 feet in diameter 250 feet  overhead it was totally silent except for a low  
hum he stared out for a few seconds  and turned to the gas station owner   and said do you see that i sure do is uh how the  gas station owner replied this object was so low  
the witness felt like he could probably take a  rock and hit it he had the impulse to do so but  
decided not to do it in case it was perceived as a  hostile act instead just watched this thing and he  
and the other guy really felt like they were both  being observed and they saw other people saw in  
this thing there's a road which circles the whole  lavender pit cop mine copper mine and they saw  
other cars driving by stopping bending over and  looking at this thing and then speeding away after  
a short while this object accelerated away  quickly towards the queen mine in bisby  
and wasn't long after that a jet fighter appeared  and this jet fighter was only a few hundred feet  
high and was apparently following this object  because it was going exactly where this object  
had gone and as the witness says our government  knows about these things who is kidding who here  
a very famous and well-known sighting occurred  over the morenci arizona copper smelting plant  
and this involved again a number of witnesses this  was on october 23rd 1980 at least five uh workers  
in the morenci arizona uh copper plant saw  this dull black boomerang shaped object  
and it approached right over the smokestacks of  this copper plant and hover over them directly  
sending down a bright beam of light into each  and every one of these smoke stacks and not  
only that it stopped over one of these  smoke stacks and sent down this little   probe or fireball or something into the smokestack  itself and at one point these objects were  
moving away and one of the workers joe  navares mentally called out no don't go  
away come back i want to see you again  and one of these objects actually stops  
this object stops makes a u-turn and comes back  really close hovers briefly and moves off again  
so this incident received a lot of publicity   and actually according to the international  center for ufo research which is a small  
private ufo organization centered in scottsdale  arizona throughout the 1980s they received a  
number of reports of ufos over the marensa  morenci area over the small town of morenci  
and in one one of these settings they said it was  actually witnessed by hundreds of people including   a bunch of people at the marinci high school who  described it as being several football fields  
in size so many many cases in arizona but we need  to move on to the humanoid cases now and this is  
where it gets really interesting i've six cases  involving humanoids not counting the one that i'd  
already cited above and here's another humanoid  case which took place in actually morenci arizona  
and i'm not sure what to make of this case this  comes from mufon it occurred in clifton arizona at  
august 11 2017 apparently at the mourincy copper  mine and i'll just quote the witness here directly  
at work in the copper mine in morenci arizona  a friend of mine saw this bright light through  
the window he went outside and took a picture  a few days later while showing the picture to a  
friend it was enlarged and you could make out a  small human-like figure on the left side of the  
glowing object the fence in the picture is about  six feet high behind it is a lay down yard behind  
the lay down yard is an eight to nine foot berm  that it past that it drops off around 100 feet
so he's saying there's a  cliff right behind all of this   and yeah you can see this little green humanoid  in this photo and i i can't comment on the photo  
you'll have to make up your own mind about it but  i can tell you that this area has been repeatedly  
visited over and over again and i doubt most  people know that except for those who work there
another humanoid case is actually very well known  in the ufo literature the main witness is stephen   michalek and this occurred on may 20th 1967  when this guy my cowlick approached a landed ufo  
the door was open he could  hear voices talking inside   and he actually uh called out and uh  tried to talk to it they did not respond  
and uh finally this door closes and this object  takes off he's pretty badly burned he suffers  
you know burns on his face and chest and  immediately has a headache and vomiting and  
suffers all kinds of symptoms dizziness nausea  diarrhea weakness swelling of joints weight  
loss his blood count drops it's a long  complicated case i won't get too into it  
but what's very interesting is where this object  landed stuart hunt did a study of it stuart hunt  
was up from the department of health and social  welfare and found significant levels of radium-226  
which could not be produced naturally and stephen  michalek returned to this area and found two  
strange w-shaped silver bars and chunks  of silver where this object had hovered  
and these were also analyzed by brian cannon a  researcher who found that the silver concentration  
was much higher than normal than normally would be  found in native silver such as sterling or coinage  
and the metal showed signs of heating and bending  and radioactivity and had fine quartz crystals  
uh in small crystals of a uranium silicate  material in pitch blend and feldspar  
and hematite embedded into it so not naturally  forming and yeah a very well-known case which  
may not be directly tied to a mine  but it's definitely one case of a ufo   hovering over a mining area and causing weird  changes here's another case which comes from  
canada this is caledonia in ontario and it  occurred at 2 30 a.m on june 13 1967 the  
main witness is carmen cunaio who worked at this  mine in caledonia and he saw two craft hovering  
one of them was 12 feet above the lower part  of the mine dump it was about 36 36 feet long  
cigar shaped with four windows and it had this arm  like device this like boom extended from one end  
and the other object was hovering higher up and it  was much smaller and appeared to be a 15 foot wide  
saucer shaped craft i was was even more interested  in the these two craft was that uh carmen cuneo  
saw three small men humanoid uh apparently  wearing miners hats with kind of lights on them  
and uh again this is in the middle of the night   and they were standing under the arm  that was extending out of this object  
he observed them for about 10 minutes long enough  to see that these were not normal and these were  
saucer men and he went to get another witness he  got his friend merv hannigan and called him over  
and by this time the humanoids were gone but the  objects were still there they watched it for about  
20 minutes at about three o'clock 305 the objects  turned on colored lights and took off to the  
southwest they were totally silent but at dawn  they went out there and investigated and did find  
a large gouge on the ground and some weird  oily residue on the trees on the burdock leaves  
the oil was analyzed but not found to be any  type of oil that they could link to a normal oil
so many cases involving humanoids as well another  case probably one of the most amazing cases  
occurred in brush creek california in 1953 it's  a classic case it's been covered in a number of  
books investigated by a number of investigators  jim and coral lorenzen looked into it leonard  
stringfield and other researchers and it all  began in 1953 around april when these two miners  
john black and john van allen started seeing ufos  hovering over their mind they saw it a few times  
and then it returned on april 20th and harvard  was pretty low level for a long period of time  
right over the mine and again a metallic saucer  precisely exactly one month later this time may  
20th this object actually landed at the junction  of marvel and jordan creek right next to this mine  
and uh takes off and afterwards john black  approached and he could see that there were  
little five inch footprints um all over the  place in the sand and he had also saw evidence  
of it looked like a campfire was very strange  uh and it got even stranger because again one  
month later now it's june 20th this object  lands again this time uh john black sees  
the uh this person thought it was a child at first  at again the junctions of marvel and jordan creek  
and as he approached he saw that there was  this landed saucer right next to it and  
this was just a short little humanoid  apparently male he was wearing green  
pants had weird shoes a weird jacket and kind of  a green cap he said it was very very pale as if  
he had never been in the sun and had dark black  hair and was carrying this kind of shiny weirdly  
cone-shaped bucket and gathering water scooping  water up into the bucket and black john black  
croach approached as closely and as silently  as he could he got to within 40 feet when the  
little little man as he called him saw him and  quickly retreated into the craft he watched the  
man just float up right inside the door closed and  this craft immediately took off so at this point  
they went to town and uh at brush creek  and were started talking to the local  
sheriff whose name was fred preston and and uh  slipped out that they had seen this ufo and uh  
asked if it was all right ask the sheriff it's  all right if it's open season on space men  
because of they saw this thing and they proceeded  to relate this encounter to the sheriff and the  
sheriff told him that no but if uh this is what he  said i told them they'd better grab it next time  
so they'll have something to back up their story  he told him not to shoot but what he did do was  
contact the air force and the air force did show a  lot of interest in this case and this is how this  
all got very well publicized uh rumors quickly  flighted um started flying around about how this  
saucer was coming every month i would come in  exactly the same day for three months in a row  
and this story got leaked to the press and there  was just this huge media circus and surprisingly  
uh let's see it was on july 20th more than 200  people arrived at the brush creek mine in hopes  
of seeing this flying saucer land and uh this  was a huge media event there was reporters there  
there was serious investigators there was saucer  hunters and people were setting up snack bars and  
tables of food and chairs had brought cameras and  unfortunately nothing ever showed up the predicted  
landing never occurred and the whole thing was a  bust uh there was accusations of of course of uh  
hoaxing at this point but all the people who knew  these minors said that no they were upstanding  
uh men who were not super well educated had never  read any science fiction or anything like this  
vi belcher the owner of the local store said that  she knew they were quote not drinking men uh so  
they were interviewed by gray barker and paul  spade uh both of who during their investigations  
of this incident were actually jailed  by fred preston the brush creek sheriff  
and as grey barker says spade made what  i considered an objective investigation  
and reported that the story was evidently  not a hoax whatever black saw the story  
sounds almost too good for someone to think up  especially when such a story is credited credited  
to an isolated minor who is not likely  to be at all well read on science fiction  
and a lot of other researchers took note of  this case and there was no evidence of a hoax  
ever found certainly the air force seemed very  interested we know this now because of documents  
released through the freedom of information act  and they did conduct an investigation and really  
for no evident reason that i can find other than  it's an incredible story they labeled it a hoax i  
don't think so because there's so many cases like  this here's the case reported from jacques ballet  
and this occurred over the french gulch gold gold  mine in northern california the main witnesses  
are clint and jane chapin and this first event  occurred on the morning of october 30th 1969  
when both clint and jane saw this oval-shaped  object silver in color landed among the trees  
and they went over to investigate  and found this weird pile of sand   which they collected and i'll have more to say  on this weird pile of sand later but uh it was  
some years later seven years later on december  27 1976 they were driving to their property  
and came upon this egg-shaped object landed  in the road near their home uh clint got out  
and uh after seeing this object tells jane  to go who's in the car to get the gun and
give it to him so she exits the car at which  point she hits an invisible barrier and she's  
knocked unconscious at the same time clint has  his uh arm pinned behind his back and he's thrown  
off the road and also knocked unconscious both of  them woke up to find that they had urinated their  
pants they felt very sick very cold and chilled  and even weeks later felt very sick and were  
suffering what came to be chronic health effects  from this event this is when they contacted  
jacques valley and one year later they  had another incident on october 13th 1977  
they were working at the mine when they felt an  unexplained wave of heat sweep over them they  
didn't see anything but both instantly became  ill and started vomiting and uh they think this  
object was trying was harassing them  and as jane says following this incident  
sweats when sitting on a chair and at  night he turns real red in the face  
so it was causing them profound ill  effects physiological effects on january 14  
1978 jane actually saw the beings that were  harassing them at this mine at their gold  
mine as jacques vallee says the head was flat with  large eyes and a big nose it was a short humanoid  
but apparently not your typical grey and  she's not the only one who saw it turned out   the neighborhood kid a 12 year old boy saw what  he described as an unusual humanoid creature he  
became very very upset about it and traumatized  and these encounters just kept occurring
this being would not leave the chapins alone it  was two years later on april fourth 1980 when the  
chapins who are now in their 80s see this humanoid  again and i'll just quote jane here we turned to  
go down the road and there was a skinny thing in  the road he was four foot tall and skinny maybe  
90 pounds and his egg the ufo was not 25 feet  from us he took four steps toward us and my hand  
fell on my gun and he turned around and walked  back he was in a gray suit and he left no prints  
or any prints on the egg clint could not move  either then the thing vanished and the egg went  
straight up in the air and turned west two months  after this tragically clint chapin passed away and  
uh that jack valet was able to obtain a sample of  this sand that they had originally collected when  
this object first appeared and he had it analyzed  and showed several very unusual properties and  
i'll just quote from the analyst who analyzed this  weird sand that was left by a ufo as the analyst  
says the problem with your sand is it's not sand  perhaps it looks like sand to you but it's not  
alluvial sand or stream sand or beach sand or mine  tailing sand or any kind of naturally formed sand  
there is some silt stone some volcanic  material here is some sulfide bearing rock  
green crystals feldspar pyrite cubes  all these fragments are very angular  
all the components are common but they don't  belong together this is a composite of rock  
fragments and manufactured materials  it's as if somebody has taken minerals  
from very different areas and growled  them together until it looked like sand
an amazing case with amazing physical evidence  jacques vallee calls it his quote favorite case  
and as he says the chapins i was convinced were  not lying i did believe them and i still do
so one other humanoid case and i'll wrap this  up this last case is unsubstantiated but it's  
definitely interesting and it occurred on august  27 1989 in an area well known for very deep minds  
this is donetsk ukraine and there are many mines  here i'm not sure what mine this was but a cor  
according to the source in this case an electrical  worker was in a mine more than 350 feet below the  
surface when he saw quote two strangers who were  standing by an electric train depot and he knew  
nobody was supposed to be there he he was alone so  he felt a wave of fear when he saw these things uh  
and he looked at him carefully and could see that  they were appeared to be studying the equipment  
in the mine so he slowly approached and when he  got within shouting distance he asked who are you  
what are you doing here and the figure stopped  and looked and began to approach him and this  
is when he could see that they were clearly  not human as the report reads on this case  
they were short creatures dwarf-like with  sallow facial complexions and features he  
could not recognize as human both were dressed in  silvery colored coveralls and on their chest they  
had lighted circles and luminous dots circling  around like the screen on an oscillograph after  
standing for a while the entities turned around  and walked away quickly moving away then floating  
just above the ground in several seconds they  vanished behind a bend in the underground tunnel
so there you go that's more than 50 cases of  ufos hovering over mines in some cases they're  
affecting the minds as you see they've people  have photographed these things taken moving films  
humanoids have been seen there's evidence of  a cover-up lots of landing trace cases i had  
done a preliminary study of ufos and mines in  my book not from here volume one but turned out  
there was a lot more than i actually thought and  uh very important cases i think i think they're  
important because these include all kinds  of encounters close encourages of the first  
second and third kind i think it's important  because they've been occurring for over 70 years  
i think it's important because these cases provide  excellent evidence of ufo reality with all these  
photographs and landing traces and physical  evidence and physiological effects and thirdly  
i think these are important because of the way  these objects are showing an interest in minds  
i think this points towards the likelihood  that we are dealing with extraterrestrials   in the classic sense who are interested in  the minerals and the metals of our planet  
and are mining them if this phenomena is truly say  demonic or perhaps a mysterious interdimensional  
intelligence that wears different masks  why would it be hovering repeatedly over  
various minds for over 70 years all across our  planet and sometimes actually taking the metals  
themselves so yeah i think this is  good evidence that we're dealing   at least in a lot of these cases with  extraterrestrials in the classic sense  
and it's very interesting that they do seem to  be particularly interested in cases involving the   more rare metals or the more valuable i should  say titanium and uranium is certainly used in  
atomics so yeah that's my presentation thanks  once again for listening and keep having fun.
