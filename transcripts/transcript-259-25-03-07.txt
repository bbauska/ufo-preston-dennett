UNEARTHLY: TWELVE VERY WEIRD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS
Mar 7, 2025

Summary:
Mar 7, 2025
There is nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature. An experience like 
this almost always has a profound effect on the witness, challenging them mentally, emotionally, 
and spiritually. It is something they remember for the rest of their lives. Encounters like these 
are far more common than you might think, and involve a mind-boggling variation of humanoid types. 
Here are ten little-known cases coming from across the planet, each involving different humanoid 
creatures, from tiny beings less than a foot tall, to creatures upwards of twelve feet in height. 
Several involve multiple witnesses, not to mention landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, 
animal reactions and medical effects.

A SIX-INCH HUMANOID. On April 20, 1945, an anonymous priest was picking edible mushrooms in the 
forest near Reneve, France when he saw a 6-inch-tall little man wearing a full-body jumpsuit and 
carrying a little rod strapped to his back. The stunned priest wanted to capture the little man, 
but it quickly ran off into the bushes.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. One day in Spring of 1957, two 9-year-old boys were playing 
in a field near their homes in Taboada, Spain when movement caught their eye. Looking up, they 
saw a row of helmeted humanoids walking through the wall of house and up into the air where they 
promptly disappeared.

AN ALIEN AT THE FRONT DOOR. On the night of August 31, 1968, a lady heard a loud knock on the front 
door of her home in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. Opening the curtain, she saw a strange man, nearly 7 
feet tall with a bald head, no ears, and glowing eyes, wearing a shiny black jumpsuit. She was 
paralyzed in fear as the man moved off, laughing.

ETS INVESTIGATE FARMHOUSE. On February 6, 1969, Jose Antonio Fioco was working at a farm in 
Pirassununga, Brazil when a UFO landed on the property. Three humanoids appeared, one sending 
down a beam of light on the chicken coop. This was just the first of many encounters in the 
area, including another landing witnessed by a crowd of people.

TWO HUMAN-LIKE FIGURES. One night in January 1974, a father and son were woken up when their home 
in Pjedsted, Denmark filled with light. Looking outside, they saw a saucer-shaped craft and two 
humanoids looking straight down at them. So began a 5-minute-long staring contest which ended only 
as the craft moved away.

THE ALIEN IN THE FOREST. Going into woods to train his dog around midnight on January 4, 1977, an 
auto-worker from Carapito, Portugal came upon a large saucer-shaped craft with a humanoid standing 
below it. After a few moments, the craft and humanoid disappeared, but researchers later found 
landing traces at the site.

THE GIANT GLOWING FIGURE. At 10pm on night in November 1977, John and Gail Weldon drove along a 
rural road in the Megalong Valley in NSW, Australia when a gigantic glowing figure upwards of 
12-feet in height strode towards their car. This is just one of several dramatic UFO incidents in 
this area.

WHAT BEAUTIFUL EYES. One night in May 1991, KT, a lady living in an apartment in the small town of 
Istok, Russia kept hearing strange footsteps. Finally she was confronted by a gray-type ET with huge 
dark beautiful eyes. Later, investigators learned that other people in the building reported strange 
events, including seeing a UFO that very night.

TWO VERY STRANGE HUMANOIDS. One night in Winter 1994, two young men were riding a motorbike on a 
rural road outside Musei, Italy when they came upon a 1-foot-tall humanoid with large eyes and 
pointing ears crossing the road in front of them. Years earlier, the witness and his family had an 
even more frightening encounter with a winged humanoid.

EYES LIKE A FLY. Hearing a strange beeping noise late on the night of May 10, 1995, a teenage boy 
exited the bedroom of his home in Columbia, Missouri and was terrified to see a 4-foot-tall gray 
alien staring at him through the living room glass door only three feet away.

THE ET IN THE RAIN. One night in October 1995, two 13-year-old girls were horseback riding through 
the woods near their homes in Breitbrunn, Germany. Without warning, they came upon a dome-shaped 
silver saucer covered with colored lights sitting on the ground, and next to it were little 
“munchkin-sized” humanoids.

CHARGED BY AN ALIEN. Around 7:30 pm one evening in July 2018, “Jacob” was playing in the yard of his 
grandparents' home in a rural and isolated area of Newaygo, Michigan. Movement behind a tree caught 
his eye. To his shock, a tall, skinny creature with a big bald head, large eyes and gray skin crawled 
out, stood up and stared, then suddenly charged right at him.

These twelve cases offer a brief glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face unearthly 
encounter with strange humanoids. These cases show how scary and traumatic an encounter can be, 
and make it clear that we still have a lot to learn about who is walking among us on this planet.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs 
and the Paranormal. Going to be talking about humanoids today. Today's episode is called, 
"Unearthly: 12 Very Weird Extraterrestrial Encounters". I've got a lot of cases today. 12 cases 
coming from all over the world including Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Russia, 
Australia, Argentina and Brazil, and a couple from the United States, including Missouri and 
Michigan. So quite a wide variety of locations, cases going all the way back to 1945 up to 2018. 
So some recent cases as well. What I like about this episode is there's a a huge variety of 
humanoids. I mean, we have short little ones less than a foot tall all the way up to ones that 
are over 10 ft tall. All different kinds of humanoids. It's one of the most fascinating aspects 
of humanoid encounters. And I think these cases, I've said it before, have a lot to teach us. I 
think the simplest takeaway is that we are not alone in this universe and that Earth is definitely 
an object of great interest to a wide variety of extraterrestrials. A lot of evidence supporting 
these cases. Landing traces, medical evidence, animal reactions, all of these kinds of things,
electromagnetic disturbances, and of course, a lot of multiple witness cases, which always
raises the level of credibility of a case. So, lots of cases to go over today. 

Let's just get started. First case I want to talk about is definitely one of my favorite in this 
little collection. I call this one, "A 6in humanoid". This one occurred way back in April 20, 1945 
in Renev, France. It's a very unusual case which I think deserves a wide audience. This case has 
been widely published and exhaustively investigated and documented with a 100 plus page report. On 
this case, which explored every possible explanation. It is a single witness case involving an 
anonymous ordained priest. He was 34 years old at the time of the incident. You can actually see 
him here. He's well respected in his community where he had served as a parish priest for 11 years. 
It was on April 20, 1945 that the father was sent by his governness to go pick edible champion 
mushrooms in the forest outside of Renev, France. She told him that the mushrooms grew best right 
along the edge of the forest. So that's where he went, following along a dirt road that led into 
the woods. He did have some trouble finding the mushrooms, but did manage to pick some and started 
to head back. And as the father says, "I noticed a last bush, and it was when I wanted to get up 
that I saw on my left in full sunlight this tiny little creature". 

Needless to say, the father was absolutely astonished at what he was looking at with a beautiful 
sunlit day. He had a perfect view of this tiny little 6-in humanoid. The creature was advancing 
towards him and was no more than 3 ft away. He could immediately see that this was a human-looking 
figure, pretty much normal, except for his extremely dimminionative size. As the father says, a 
rather chubby gentleman. He was pot-bellied, corpulant, very strong, robust. He was someone who 
had robust health, a man in miniature. He had a little bit of a beard, not abundant, in gray white. 
He walked very quickly. He came up to me and stared at me. He was as if out of breath, staring at 
me, and I was staring at him. You could see he was out of breath, that he was an old man. I'd give 
him an age of 70-75. What caught my attention above all was his face and his eyes. He wore a rust 
brown combination, a kind of jumpsuit. No buttons, no belts, no seams. The hands ended in a kind of 
mittens. The thumb and the fingers all enclosed. The feet, they were a kind of boot. They were all 
one, but they were flexible. Everything all made of a single garment. 

One peculiar detail about this little creature's outfit, which was skin tight, but as the father 
says, flexible, was the presence of what looked like a pike or a rod, kind of like a thorn, he said, 
cream colored, and was strapped to his side or back. This little rod stuck up over the figure's head 
about a half inch and went all the way down to his feet. The father did have the impression that it 
was used as a weapon perhaps or perhaps to probe the ground or defend himself against wildlife or he 
speculated later perhaps an antenna of some kind. 

Now the father's first impulse was to gently pick up this little humanoid, ask him who he was, 
where he came from, what he was doing there, if he needed anything because he did appear to be in 
some kind of distress. But the father didn't do that because this being was moving along. As 
the father says, I had an impression of fear and that he was in a hurry. You could feel that he 
was in a hurry. He seemed to me exhausted and frightened. He seemed to dread my presence. He 
seemed fearful of me. His piercing eyes seemed filled with fear and at the same time to want to 
observe me. He wanted to know who I was and what I was doing. So this father wondered if this 
little man was rushing to deliver information or was on some kind of mission for survival because 
he just kept walking, turning his head to keep the father in view. He actually passed just about 
one to two feet away from the father and then disappeared into a thicket that as the father says 
was quote impenetrable even for a rat or a cat. And as the father says, he passed 30 cm away from 
me while looking at me intensely. 

So the duration of this encounter was quite short, an estimated 15 seconds. Afterwards, the
father noticed no footprints. He never heard any strange sounds or smelled anything unusual. He did feel a sense of
disappointment that he had let this figure escape, but his astonishment was so great that he simply returned home.
He planned to return the next day with a sickle to cut the weeds and investigate the area. But the next few days it
rained heavily. He actually waited 30 years to share his story publicly because, as he says, and I quote, "I did
not want to spread this affair to an audience that was not qualified because I knew that this story was terribly
improbable. I said nothing in my parish. I only told it to my family, my
governness, and my brothers and sisters." Now later, some skeptical debunkers tried to say that the priest
had perhaps encountered a miniature monkey, perhaps from an escaped army regiment or a traveling circus. There
was no evidence of this, and the priest remained adamant that he had actually seen a little 6-in tall man. 

He remains uncertain whether this little man was from Earth or perhaps even possibly an extraterrestrial. 
How unusual is that case? Even though this witness only saw it for 15 seconds, he definitely has a lot 
of detail to it. I suspect that this humanoid might actually be a cryptoaterrestrial. One of the little 
people that are described in so many cultures all over this planet and not an extraterrestrial. Hard to 
say for sure. It's pure speculation. But I think that the witness is obviously sincere. He's a priest, 
a good witness. He definitely saw something. And I don't think that it was a little monkey. I don't 
know. A really unusual case and it's certainly not unique. Quite a few people have described very short 
humanoids. 

Now, here's another case which is so unusual. This one I call I have never seen anything like it. 
This is a multiple witness case involving two boys who saw multiple humanoids actually. And this 
one occurred sometime in spring of 1957 in Taboada, Spain. A really unusual case with a number of 
really interesting details to it. This very interesting case comes from researcher Marcelino Requjo 
and appears in his book Masala Deo Soron Natural, which means beyond the supernatural. The witnesses 
are two 9-year-old boys known only by their first names of Antonio and Carlos. They were playing in 
a small field near their homes on the outskirts of Tabao Ada in Lugo, Spain. This was their favorite
play spot. They often met up there with friends to amuse themselves, playing kickball, running 
around. And on this particular cloudy spring afternoon in 1957, their friends had not shown up. 

So Antonio and Carlos were alone and amused themselves by playing a game of marbles. Now suddenly 
Antonio's attention was drawn to movement at a nearby house and looking up he saw something shocking. 
This was an abandoned house and as Antonio says, "I saw out of the corner of my eye to the right 
someone walking but not at ground level but higher up as if in the air. I quickly turned my head 
towards the old house that was located about 30 m to the right. And then I saw them. They were 
moving on the roof of a small brick shed attached to the house. I was speechless. So Antonio slowly 
stood up and stared in wonder because these figures were walking in the air. He shouted out to his 
friend Carlos, "Hey, look at those guys." Now without getting up, Carlos just turned his head and 
looked. and with a calmness that astonished Antonio said, "Oh yes, they are always around here. 
I've seen them before." Now, Antonio most definitely had not seen anything like this. And as he says, 
the truth is that it was the most absurd scene. 

I have never seen
anything like it again in my life. Some tall men dressed like astronauts or
beekeepers with white helmets and suits, but wearing dark boots. They came out
from the wall of that abandoned house, one after the other, as if in single file. They walked very slowly on the
roof of the shed, as if in slow motion, with one arm extended forward, carrying
something like a lantern. The facade of the house had no doors or windows. But
the guys came out from there, from the wall itself, as if from nowhere. It's as
if they materialized when they came out. And the most incredible thing is that when each of them reached the end of the
roof, they walked right where the shed ended. They didn't fall to the ground, but suddenly disappeared, and another
guy came out from the wall of the house. I didn't count how many I saw, but at least 10 or 12. The thing must have
lasted a little more than a minute. Then they stopped coming out of the wall. The last one walking on the shed reached the
end of the roof and disappeared like the others. 

So needless to say, Antonio was
absolutely astonished and he immediately began to question Carlos about it. But
Carlos seemed weirdly blasé. All he would say is that he didn't know who they were. Antonio then surprised
himself by simply continuing to play marbles as if nothing had happened. But
while he played, he did say he angrily looked back from time to time to see if
these strange figures would appear again, which they didn't. Now afterwards he didn't tell his parents for fear that
they wouldn't believe him or that if they did believe him they would forbid him from playing there in that field.
Still the whole experience was so bizarre especially because Carlos acted as if it was nothing unusual. As Antonio
says at least I have the consolation of knowing that it was not a hallucination of mine because my friend Carlos also
saw them. What I never understood was his reaction. 

It seemed normal to him to
see those guys walking around there. He remained so cool, and we continued playing marbles as if nothing had
happened. Apparently, he had already witnessed that scene on other occasions.
But I assure you that he had never said anything to me. Now, years later, Antonio agreed to be interviewed, but
insisted on absolute anonymity and did not even want his voice recorded. But as
he says, I assure you that what I experienced that afternoon will remain engraved in my memory for life. There
you go. I'm I don't know what's going on in that case. It's interesting that the one of the witnesses saw these humanoids
multiple times. Another fascinating aspect of this particular case is how
the witnesses reacted with sort of a blasé attitude, not talking about it.
This is something we see quite often. 

It's hard to say what's going on here. Whether this is some sort of effect put
forth by the ETSs themselves or rather our own psychological response to
something that's completely unusual and out of our world view. But yeah, turns
up quite a bit. How unusual is that case with these figures just walking off into
midair and disappearing? Perhaps there was something about that house or that area that they were interested in.
Again, pure speculation, but another interesting case where there are so so
many. And here's another one. This one is so unusual. Uh there are a few cases where
ETSs have knocked at people's front door. And that's what happened in this case, which I call an alien at the front
door. This one occurred on August 31st, 1968 in Baja Blanca, Argentina. It was
pretty thoroughly researched by uh experienced investigators as well as the
police. The details on it are quite sparse, but it's such an unusual
humanoid. 

Don't know that I've ever heard anything quite like this one. The seemingly endless variety of humanoids
is well illustrated by this next very unusual case, which comes from researchers Eduardo A. Tucci and Albert
Gordano and was published in their Spanish language book Los Platos Volador
Isus Triulantes or Flying Saucers and their crews. It was about 8:00 p.m. on
August 31st, 1968 as the witness Amelia Susanna Larude de Salazar, aged 20, was
in her home with her two small children when she heard someone knocking very loudly on the front door. She did not
open the front door, but instead pulled back the curtain and looked outside. And to her shock, she saw a very tall man,
an estimated 6 to 7 feet tall, with very broad shoulders, an athletic, muscular
body, and he did not look human. He had no hair on his head, no visible ears, a
large mouth full of big teeth, but his eyes were very unusual because they were
shining with a brilliant light. 

Also, his arms were very abnormally long and
dangling. He wore a tight-fitting dull black jumpsuit, and Amelia, as you can
imagine, was frozen in fear as this strange figure started to move away backwards, but always keeping his gaze
fixed on her. And as he moved off, Amelia heard what sounded to her like
peels of muffled laughter coming from this figure. Once he reached the gate of her residence, he seemed to disappear.
She did call the police and filed a report, but that's all the details on that very unusual case. Oh, bizarre. I
mean, that is really weird. It's interesting because a number of people that I've interviewed who have been,
say, taken on board a craft have told me, I just wish the ETSs would knock on the front door and I'd invite them in.
Well, that did happen in this case, and I know of others. So, that alone, I think, makes this case pretty unusual.
But that's clearly not a normal person if his eyes are glowing like that
wearing a skintight jumpsuit. I mean, something very odd is going on with these humanoid cases. Why did that ET do
that? It's very, very strange. Now, let's move to the next case, which is
really remarkable and got quite a bit of publicity at the time. It involves multiple witnesses, landing traces, and
actually multiple incidents as well. 

I was going to cover just one incident,
but there was so much going on on this particular date in this particular area
that I really just wanted to cover all of the activity that was going on. I call this one ETS's investigate
farmhouse. Again, not just one incident, but the primary one occurred on February 6, 1969 in
Piraunga, Brazil. And I think you'll find this case super fascinating because
there are some details in here that I don't know that I've ever heard before.
The main witness in this case is Jose Antonio Fioco. He managed the Bella
Alanka farm on the outside of PiSuna, Brazil. You can see the farm
here. was around dusk on February 6, 1969 when Jose heard the pigs on the
farm grunting in their pigsty and going to investigate. This is when he noticed
a saucer-shaped craft actually landing next to the farm only about 600 ft away
from him. It was about 15 ft wide, 12 feet high, and resting on tripod landing
gear. He immediately noticed three humanoid figures which emerged through an opening in the craft. They did not
exit the craft, but stood on a sort of platform surrounding the perimeter of the craft. These were short little guys,
each about 4 feet tall. He could see that they were humanlooking. They had unshaven faces. They wore jumpsuits with
what looked to him like three metallic buttons down the torso and metallic sort
of aluminum looking boots. 

Now, one of the beings was holding a rod or a tube
just about a foot long. And this rod was sending down a beam of light onto the chicken coupe about 750 ft away, and it
was bright enough so that Jose could actually see the chickens sitting on their perches. The second being held
what looked to Jose like a camera-like device, and he was looking through it. And the third being also held a rod or
tube slightly larger than the other one. And this guy seemed to be a lookout as he was constantly looking around the
environment as if on high alert. So Jose watched all of this with with astonishment and decided to alert the
others at the farm. He walked very cautiously back to the house, but when he opened the gate, it made a loud
creaking sound, and as if in response, the craft immediately took off,
disappearing in just a few seconds. The entire event lasted no more than three
minutes. But that was not the end of it because in the days and weeks following
this event, the UFOs returned several times. In fact, Jose saw the craft at
least twice during the day, hovering about 3,000 ft high. He estimates he saw
it twice at night when they would apparently come down for a landing. And in fact, one evening about a month after
the encounter, Jose and at least 15 other people saw one of these craft land
in a cotton field about 450 ft from the farm. 

It very quickly took off. But the
next morning, they went to this spot and they found unusually thin footprints in the field which had been freshly plowed.
There was no mark in the field in terms of the craft landing there. But one month later, Jose witnessed a third
landing in the sugarce field. He saw the craft on the ground for an estimated 3
minutes. He saw figures walking into it. And later, an examination of the field
showed that some of the sugar canes had been broken and others were uprooted, and there were also more of these same
thin footprints. Now, Jose's daughter later told researchers that she had also
seen the UFOs on at least four separate occasions. Now, here is one of the
strangest aspects of this series of encounters. While all of this was going on, on occasion, while watching TV, the
programs that the family was watching were replaced by other strange images.
Jose, his wife, and his their four children all saw this. These images
included women wearing strange robes with black collars, short male figures
wearing helmets. They could hear them speaking in an unknown language, which they said was somewhat similar to
Hungarian. The images were very wavy and blurry. They kind of likened it to looking through water, and they
connected this to all these UFO encounters. 

And as it turns out, there were quite a few encounters going on in
this area at this time because it was the very next day at 7:30 a.m. on
February 7, 1969. 19-year-old Thiago Machado, you
can see him here, was woken up by people shouting about a strange craft that had
landed on a nearby hill. This is not far away from the other encounter. Thiago
decided to grab a pair of binoculars and he actually walked right up to this craft approaching to within 30 ft. He
described it as a silver metallic domed disc about 12 ft wide, maybe 5 ft high,
and he watched as a door swung open and two humanoid figures emerged. They
floated down to the ground. He could see two other figures inside the craft through the doorway. Now, the two that
came out appeared to him to be about 4 and 1/2 ft tall. They were dressed in skintight seamless silver uniforms and
wore transparent helmets. They had yellowish skin, Asian eyes with one eye
being higher than the other, or so it appeared to him, and just a slit for a mouth. They walked around the craft and
approached to within 10 feet of the witness. At one point, they seemed to be
scared of the binoculars that Thiago was using, so he laid them down on the ground, which seemed to reassure them.
Thiago then lit a cigarette and began smoking it. 

And he says the beings looked at him smoking the cigarette and
laughed. He could now see that they had dark teeth. Thiago decided to toss his pack of cigarettes at one of the
figures, who placed his hand above the pack, which had landed on the ground, and it floated up into his hand and
promptly disappeared. Thiago said that the beings were speaking audibly with quote guttural sounds. Now a whole group
of people was watching this, including Thiago's friends, and one of them shouted out to him, and as if in
response, the humanoids immediately retreated backwards into the craft. Upon
entering it, one of the humanoids pointed a tube at Thiago, which sent out a bluish ray, which struck him, causing
paralysis and some pain, and would later leave a mark on his body. After the craft was gone, Thiago
fainted. He woke up shortly later and he and researchers found imprints on the
ground where the craft had rested. 

You can see them here. Also very interesting is investigators on the scene also reported seeing this 
object hovering in the sky or one like it. And there were more encounters. Was just a few days later 
on February 9, 1969. Two boys by the name of Benedito Polino Ramos and Xiao Batista D Silva, aged 13
and nine, respectively, saw a shiny craft of some kind landed on the ground. They'd never heard of 
anything like this, so they kind of likened it to a tent. But standing next to it were three helmeted 
figures wearing shining gray jumpsuits. Now, both the boys tried to alert Xiao's mother, but she was 
too busy working, pulling weeds to pay much attention. But then the boys shouted out that the craft
had disappeared and that it was now in the sky, a luminous ball, which they said was quote, "the 
size of the sun hovering just above the ground." 

Again, they tried to point it out to Ziao's mother, asking her what it was, but she
paid no attention. It was only after the Thiago Machado case was publicized that
she realized that the boys had probably seen this craft. And there was another case. A
final encounter in Pura Sununga occurred on February 12, 1969. Again, just a few
days later was 5:40 a.m. farmer Luis Flozinho de Alivera was walking to work
with his dog when he says that two 4- foot tall beings with long hair, beards,
and unusual looking eyes approached him. He said they wore white unbuttoned
shirts, beige pants decorated with what looked like colorful inscriptions and drawings, and were also wearing dark
shiny medallions on necklaces on their chest. He says they physically grabbed
him, and he immediately fought back, easily, knocking them to the ground. He heard the beings speak to each other in
a strange language. 

They then turned to Louise and speaking perfect Portuguese
told him that since he was much stronger than they, they would leave him alone and they immediately fled into the
underbrush. Now during his encounter, Luz's dog curled up on the ground in a
ball to protect himself. Following the encounter, he was apparently traumatized. He refused to eat. He would
never go near that location of the encounter again. And per the report on this case, he did pass away one month
later, though it's not clear whether it was a result of this case or not. Not
the only case in this area. There was another very unusual case in the same area one year earlier. So, something's
going on in this area that is attracting the interest of the ETSs. Very, very
strange. There must have been something in this area that the ETSs found of interest. there being so many encounters
over such a short period of time, but so well authenticated. I mean, we've got
dozens of people in that one case seeing this UFO land and one of the witnesses
walking right up to it and having an interaction with these ETs. 

Something like this is really hard to deny with
all the landing traces and the footprints. One of the most fascinating things for me about this case, the first
one in particular, was the weird images that appeared on the television. I mean, how do you explain that? Hard to say for
sure whether this was related directly to their encounter, but the witnesses certainly thought so. Very strange. Lots
to unravel and unpack in all of these cases. Now, let's move to the next one, which is a fairly straightforward
account. If you can call a UFO encounter straightforward. It's a pretty interesting one though. Very close up
observation of a UFO in humanoids by two witnesses. I call this one two humanlike
figures. This occurred in January of 1974 in Pezstead, Denmark. Probably
butchered that name, so sorry. Uh but yeah, this is a really interesting case
because this shows like many other cases what appears to be ETS showing
themselves on purpose. Can't say for sure, but given that the witnesses
describe these ETs looking directly at them, certainly makes me wonder about it. This next case involves two
witnesses, a father and son. They're anonymous. It's quite a brief incident,
but certainly interesting. They were in their home in Ped in Frederica Jutland,
Denmark. 

This case was published in the magazine UFO Neat in the September
October 1977 issue. Now, this case began when the adult son woke up to see a
bright yellow light coming from outside. He woke up his father. They both went
into the living room and looking out the window saw this very strange craft hovering about 450 ft away and it lit up
the interior of their house so brightly that as one of the witnesses said he could have found a pen on the floor.
Now, as the father says, and I quote, "It turned out to be a circular object standing immediately behind the trees
with about half of the object visible above the trees. With binoculars and the
naked eye, two humanlike figures could be easily seen wearing a gray white
tight fitting suit. Now, the witnesses said that the figures did have normal human features. They saw that their
hands were bare, no gloves on them, but they did see that the figures were wearing dark colored helmets, which they
said were very much like ski helmets with a transparent visor. And as the witnesses watched the figures, these
figures appeared to be staring right back at them. As the father says, while
we were looking at the object and the figures through the binoculars, they tilted a visor down in front of their
faces. 

The object tilted slightly forward as if to be able to better look
down towards the house where we were staying. So this was a sort of staring contest which lasted a full five minutes
at which point the light from the object went out. The object was no longer visible or it disappeared and moved
away. But one detail noted by the witnesses was that both the figures were wearing what looked like a necklace
which held a sort of rectangular apparatus of some kind. Quite small, just a few inches in diameter. They had
no idea what the purposes of this apparatus might be. How interesting is that? I would love to have an experience
like that. Just seeing a UFO hover outside your house. ET is looking down at you. It's a pretty fascinating case.
And I certainly wonder about it because did this craft show up there on purpose
to show themselves to these two people or was it just a chance encounter? Hard
to say for sure, but it sure is unusual given that the ETSs were looking down directly at them and kind of the staring
contest went on for a number of minutes. Really unusual. And here's another case
which also has these unusual aspects to it. I call this next case the alien in
the forest. This occurred on January 4, 1977 in Carapito, Portugal. Telling you
these cases are occurring everywhere. 

This one does appear to be a chance
encounter. Hard to say for sure, but this gentleman was out there in the wilderness with his dog and had this
amazing UFO encounter with a humanoid. This very unusual case comes from
well-known researcher Juan Balster Almos and was published in his book Encyclopedia of Close Encounters with
UFOs. The witness is anonymous and is known only by his initials,
CACM. For the purpose of this report, I'll just give him the pseudonym Carlos. He was employed as a technician at an
automobile plant. And it was around 12:30 a.m. on January 4, 1977, just
after midnight, a clear moonlight night, Carlos was training his dog, a German
Shepherd, in a rural field surrounded by pine trees, not far from his home in
Carapito Beie, Alta. This is in Portugal. And the first indication of
anything unusual was when Carlos's dog became agitated and ran back towards him
sitting down next to him. This is when Carlos looked up and saw a dark metallic
object hovering not far away, about 30 feet, he estimates, 30 feet up in the
air. And this craft was not huge. 

It was an estimated 20 feet in diameter. He
could see a dome-like structure on top. And he could also hear that it was making a weird staticky kind of beep
beep beep noise. And it was around the same time that Carlos noticed this craft that he also saw a humanoid figure
standing on the ground below it at the foot of a small hill. This figure was
about he estimates 5 1/2 ft tall. Had a bulky heavy set body but a normal
humanlike appearance. It was making no movements. It just stood there. And
after only a few moments, the craft emitted a bright flash of silvery light
and both the craft and the figure disappeared. And that was pretty much the end of it. The dog now showed no
concern or fear. But following the encounter, the witness did suffer from some physiological effects apparently
related to this encounter. He said he had severe headaches and weakness which
were bad enough that he was unable to work and did consult a doctor. Also
later researchers did find a compressed circle of vegetation about 8 ft wide not
far from the grove of pine trees where Carlos had seen this craft. They did use
a radiation detector where Carlos had seen the figure and measured higher than normal amounts of radiation. though they
did say that there are known uranium deposits in this general area. 

Now, shortly after this incident, Carlos's dog ran away, but did reappear several months later. 8 months after this
encounter, the dog, while still young of age, did die of unknown causes, but again, not clear if this is in any way
connected to the UFO encounter. A weird case for sure. And yeah, a single witness case, but then again, there's
possible landing traces associated with it. Uh, and that makes you wonder, you
know, how many other people could have seen this thing and just didn't report on it. It's absolutely possible a number
of people did see it. Let's move to the next encounter, which is very unusual.
Not haven't heard of one quite like this. This is a very very large humanoid
which I call the giant glowing figure. This occurred one evening in November of
1977 in the Megalong Valley in Australia. And this is apparently just a
chance encounter with people driving down a remote road late at night and seeing something quite unusual. But as
it turns out, there's quite a bit of activity in this area. So that maybe
there's something to this area that is attracting the attention of the UFOs and
their occupants. But I think you'll find this case quite interesting. Multiple cases, actually. This next unusual case
is quite brief, but it's apparently only one of several unusual UFO events in
this area. 

It involves two witnesses, a married couple by the name of John and
Gail Weldon. It was about 1000 p.m. one evening in November of
1977 as the Weldens drove along the Geneline Caves Road in the Megalong
Valley after visiting the very famous Geneline Caves. They were just a few
miles out of the small town of Hampton along this road which you can see here
when they saw what they described as a gigantic yellow glowing humanoid form.
They said it emerged from the thick scrub on the passenger side of their vehicle and proceeded to walk towards
the road. In mere moments, it was crossing the road just about 45 ft in
front of their car. Now, John, who was driving, immediately pressed the brakes
and brought the car to a halt, at which point the being promptly stroed towards
the now terrified couple and towered over their car, staring down at them.
The Weldens could now see that this figure did have a human-like face. But
just after a few seconds, this very tall being turned and walked off the road and
back into the wilderness. 

And as you can imagine, the Weldens quickly raced away.
So that's it in terms of that encounter. But again, it's not the only encounter to occur in the Megalong Valley.
Five years earlier in nearby Katumba, the Edelbuttal family became witnesses
to an incredible UFO event that was very wellverified and publicized as well. It
was one evening in July of 1971 that Bernie and Merl Edabutle were
hosting Merl's sister and husband Ann and Bill Pierce at their home.
Strangely, throughout the evening, they noticed that the TV was showing an unusual amount of static, but didn't
think too too much of it until after what happened next. Because it was
around 10:30 p.m. that evening that the Pierces decided to leave and return home. 10 minutes later, they came back
to the house pale and shaken because, as Bill Pierce says, as we were driving out
of the yard, we saw a strange orange light in the back paddic where the pigs are kept. At first, I thought it was a
fire, then a row of truck lights, but it was glowing too brightly to be either.
It looked like a ring of small lights and was about 200 yd away, lighting up the trees. As it glowed, it increased in
intensity until it hurt to look straight at the light. It was exactly like looking. Now, Bill's wife, Anne, also
saw it, and as she says, it must have been a UFO because it was so unearly.
Neither my husband nor I are nervous. 

But this terrified us. Even my little
four-year-old pointed to it and said, "Monster lights." So they watched this for about five minutes when the strange
lights merged into one and faded away. And as Bill says, I have no idea what it
was. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Now reportedly the Edetos
also saw this object which they described as saucershaped and of considerable t size. And as it turns
out, there were numerous other witnesses to this event. People driving along the Great Western Highway also described
seeing this light. Another farmer who lived near this family also said that
they saw a large dark object descend slowly into the Megalong Valley and
actually land in his deserted field. This witness described this object as being about 30 feet wide and totally
silent. It remained on the ground for 10 minutes, then rose upwards and darted
off. where it landed. There was a circular depression on the ground where
the grass would no longer grow. Now, police were of course called, but the UFO had left by that time, and further
investigation revealed that only the week before this, numerous people in the area were reporting seeing strange
lights. Now, there is one final case, which this occurred much more recently,
one evening in September 2019. This is approximate. It was around 9:00 p.m.
when a gentleman by the name of Charlie Kennedy was driving through the forest just off the Gentle Caves Road. Without
warning, his car engine died. So, he got out of his vehicle to check the engine. And this is when he saw what he
describes as a large quote flying saucer. 

He said it was 45 ft wide, had a
dome on top, was hovering just above the road. The bottom of this craft, he said,
had several round yellow lights, and the dome itself was also encircled by
lights. And as Charlie says, I was worried about what might happen next,
but the saucer began emitting a thumping sound and rose rapidly high into the air
and flew off slowly into a pine forested valley to the southeast, out of sight. I found the car could be started again, so
I lost no time in getting out of the area. There you go. I don't mean to be rude, but those who are skeptical of
UFOs simply have not done their research. How many cases is it going to take? How many people have to see
humanoids before all humanity accepts the fact that we are not alone in this
universe? There are a lot of people out there. I mean, it's just case after case after case after case. Here's another
one which I call what beautiful eyes. That is a direct quote from the witness.
This case occurred in May of 1991 in IstA, Russia. Again, cases coming from
all over the world. And this one is really unusual because to me, the most
fascinating aspect of this case is how the witness describes this humanoid. And
almost always witnesses are really impressed by the being's eyes. And
that's certainly true in this case, which is primarily a single witness
case, but not really because, as it turns out, she was in an apartment building and other people saw the UFO
outside at the time she was having her encounter with a humanoid. I want to give thanks to Alberto Rosales for
calling my attention to this case which comes from researcher Maxim Shishkin who
published it in an article called Aliens in the Eurals in the 7-8 1995 issues of
the Eural Pathfinder. 

This incident took place in Eastto. This is near Yaketarinberg,
Russia and involves a lady known only by her initials KT. She lived in an
apartment building. And it was around 11:00 p.m. one evening in late May of
1991 that Katie went to bed, but for some reason had trouble falling asleep
and actually remained awake for 3 hours until about 2:00 in the morning. At this
time, her bedroom door was open. She could hear her husband watching hockey on the TV in the living room. and she
was just starting to doze off when she heard the door creaking followed by footsteps. So, she didn't see anybody.
Got out of bed, looked into the living room. Her husband was still on the couch watching TV. Nobody else was in the
house except for her young daughter who remained asleep in Katie's bedroom next to Katie's bed. So, that was weird.
Didn't think too much of it. She crawled back into bed, started to fall asleep when again she heard footsteps. And this
time she heard him heading towards the bathroom and then moving beyond. She thought it was her husband, but she
became scared, kept her eyes closed, and this is when she heard the footsteps enter her room and stand next to her
bed. 

Immediately, she began to feel some strange sensations. She said her body
cramped and her arms and legs began to straighten out. Then she actually felt someone's hands lifting her off the bed.
At this point, she tried to move and scream, but found that she was unable to, but with great effort, she was able
to groan. Whoever was lifting her abruptly removed his hands, and Katie
fell back onto the bed. She heard the steps move off towards the bedroom door.
She still kept her eyes closed, but when she felt someone's gaze staring at her,
she opened her eyes. There was nobody there, but she did know that she was unable to see anything from behind the
headboard of her bed. So, after a few minutes, she sat up, looked, and saw a
white circle in the doorway. And this is when she saw something else. And I'll
just describe it in Katie's own words. As she says, a creature a little over a
meter tall was standing nearby. 

It was a small man with a large head, the
proportions of which did not correspond to the body. On the head was a white
hat, very reminiscent of a Muslim turban in its outline. My attention was drawn
to the face, especially the large eyes with long eyelashes and a blackness
inside. I thought, "What beautiful eyes!" And then he stepped into the
middle of the circle, blocking it with his body, after which everything disappeared. I sat on the bed for a
while, shaking violently with fear. After a few minutes, Katie got up and
checked the house. Her daughter was still asleep. Everything seemed normal. She looked for her husband, and he was
now asleep on the couch. She returned to bed, but didn't sleep that night. And
the next night, she said she also had trouble sleeping because it looked like, as she says, rays were coming out of the
wall. Now, her case did reach investigators, and they found out that on the same night KT had seen this
humanoid. Other residents in her apartment building also reported strange events, including hearing strange
clicking noises, hearing the sounds of footsteps, and also finding mysteriously
unlocked and open windows and doors. Most significantly, a few reported
seeing a glowing yellow UFO outside of the apartment building sending down
three beams of light. How weird is that? 

I mean, in some ways that does sound
like a typical gray, but then again, you know, the eyelashes and the weird hat on
top of the head. I don't know. It's very odd. I'm perplexed by the wide variety
of descriptions people give of humanoids, but I suppose it's not that surprising when you consider the wide
variety of people here on this planet alone. I mean, all the different
ancestries. We have people who are quite short, people who are quite tall, all kinds of skin
complexions, all kinds of different shapes to people. So, I suppose it's
just the way things are. The humanoid form does seem to be the universal
template. Almost always people do describe beings that we would say are
bipedal. I don't know. This is kind of what we're stuck with. This is what the evidence is showing us. Here is another
case which involves a gentleman who actually saw two different humanoids on
two separate occasions and both are very very unusual. One's super short and the
other has wings. So yeah, I call this one two very strange humanoids. The
first case occurred in winter of 1994 in Musea, Italy. And both these incidents
involving this witness are actual actually multiple witness encounters. So he's not the only one who saw these very
strange humanoids. 

This next case involves two separate incidents, both of which come from Italian researcher
Pierre Giorgio Mgia and were published in his book, Aliens in the Land of
Najes. This is both in English and in Italian. This is a multiple witness case
and the first incident involves two witnesses. Now, this took place in the
town of Musea located in Sardinia, Italy. The main witness is Simone Saba,
who at this time was 22 years old. It was one evening in the winter of
1994. It was a full moon. Simone and his friend were driving to Simone's house.
They were in the rural countryside on the outskirts of Musea, heading along a dirt road, when suddenly the headlight
of the motorbike that they were riding illuminated a very small humanoid figure. This figure appeared to be less
than 1 ft tall, and they could both see that it looked very much like a person,
but with several marked differences. 

First, its head was oversized for its
body. It had very thin hair, pointed ears. The body also was very thin. The
being did not appear to have any clothes on. Now, Simone, who was driving, saw it
first and immediately alerted his friend, who also saw this strange being.
This being had been walking across the road, but stopped when the headlights from the motorbike shone on him. It
looked briefly at the two witnesses, then quickly continued walking across the road and disappeared into the
bushes. Now, in the days following this encounter, Simone traveled the same route with his dogs. And on each
occasion, the dogs would stop and excitedly smell the area exactly where this being had disappeared into the
bushes. It was not long after the encounter that a fire broke out in this
area, not related, but it left the terrain bare of any vegetation, and it
was then that Simone discovered a strange round hole in the ground, exactly where the being had disappeared.
He wondered if perhaps this little hole was where the being had come from or escaped to on the night of his
encounter. 

Now, this turned out not to be Simone's only encounter. 15 years
earlier when he was only 7 years old. He had a really frightening encounter and
there were other witnesses at that time. He and his family lived in a rented home. This is the same town of Musea.
The home had a locked attic which they had never had the opportunity to explore but always wondered what was in it. Now,
one evening in autumn of 1979, Simone, his little sister Daniela, who was 2
years old, and another child friend were playing outside the house when they noticed movement at the locked attic
window of this house. And looking up, they could see a strange humanoid figure
perched by the window. They said it was about four to 5t tall, had an abnormally
long neck, a human-looking face with a kind of lumpy oversized forehead,
glowing red eyes, and dark black skin. But most strikingly, this figure had
huge wings similar to those of a bat with a wingspan of about six feet.
And as it lingered by the window for a few moments, Simone called out his father, Antonio, who came out and also
saw this strange winged being. 

At this point, the being leapt upwards into the
air, hovered there momentarily, fluttering for a few moments, and then flew off into the darkness of the night.
Panicked and afraid, the four witnesses rushed into the house. Antonio, the
father, in fact, was so overcome by the sight that he actually wept with
emotion. They never saw this winged being again. Very, very strange. Again,
I'm not sure that we can label both of these humanoids as quote extraterrestrials.
That short little guy could very well be again more on the lines of an elf or
gnome or you know dwarf or whatever you want to call these little people that we see
in so many different cultures. As far as this winged being, I wonder about that
too. Very much kind of like the moth man of Point Pleasant, Virginia years ago.
Uh not a unique description. And there's quite a few cases of winged beings which
I wonder about too. I think it is significant that no UFO was seen in
either of those incidents. 

So perhaps that winged being was an interdimensional creature. Still lots of
questions surrounding all of this. But I think it's important that we document these cases because clearly something is
going on. Would be wholly unscientific to ignore them. There are far too many
cases. far too many witnesses, far too much evidence to explain this all away as hoaxes, hallucinations,
misperceptions, or mental illness, which is exactly what our governments have tried so hard to make us think. It's not
true. These things are real. Here's another case, very unusual. Again,
witnesses are often impressed by the being's eyes. True in this case, I call
this one eyes like a fly. This one occurred on May 10,
1995 in Colombia, Missouri. It is a single witness case, but I really feel
for this witness who was a young child who had a very, very close encounter with what appears to be a gray type
extraterrestrial. This next case was reported on by Albert Rosales, also was
reported to New Fork, the National UFO Reporting Center, and did appear in the UFO Intelligence Newsletter and the
publication Acton. It is a single witness case involving an anonymous
young man. There's no physical evidence supporting this case, but nevertheless, it's quite compelling. I'll call the
witness Ethan. That's a pseudonym. This is not his real name. It was just before
3:00 a.m. on May 10, 1995. Ethan was in his father's home in
Columbia, Missouri, reading the Time Life book, Mystic Places, All About Stonehenge and Other Places. Suddenly,
he was distracted by a strange computer-like beeping noise. And after hearing this for about 10 minutes, he
decided to get up, leave his bedroom, and investigate the source of this beeping. So he walked down the hallway
to the family room and the kitchen. The only source of illumination was a small light over the kitchen sink. But
standing in the family room, Ethan caught movement out of the corner of his eye look and looking through the double
sliding glass patio door which the blinds were open. 

He saw something
unusual. This is where the movement was coming from. So he approached within about three feet of the patio door and
looked outside when to his shock he saw a small humanoid figure walk right up to
the patio door, stop about 3 feet away and peer inside. Although it was dark, the light
from the kitchen was sufficient to illuminate the area, and Ethan could immediately see that this figure was not
human. He described it as quote, "a little man." He estimates that it was about 3 and 1/2 maybe 4 feet tall. It
had a large head and quote eyes like a fly. This figure was very slender with
two abnormally long arms, extremely long fingers with silvery gray in color and
was either naked or wore a skintight full body jumpsuit. At this point, the being
leaned forward from the waist and stared directly at the witness. shocked and frozen with fear, even had
no choice but to just stare back. He said that he had never been so scared in his life, and that the hair, quote,
stood up on his arms. 

This staring contest lasted for just a few minutes,
at which point Ethan suddenly broke free from his paralysis, ran straight to the
kitchen, retrieved a butcher knife, and took shelter in the corner of the family room, just out of view of the sliding
door. He was too afraid to look to see if this being was still there, and he remained huddled there in fear for
nearly an hour. Finally, about 4:00 a.m., he summoned the courage to rush in
panic into his father's bedroom, woke him up, and told him what happened. His
father immediately checked the house and the patio area, but this little man was gone. So he called the Columbia Police
Department who referred him to the National UFO Reporting Center and this resulted in the case being officially
investigated and reported. 

The poor kid in this case, you know, hovering there in the corner of his living room for
almost an hour. I can only imagine what an impression that this encounter had on him. Um, and they called the police who
of course referred them to New Fork, which led to this case being officially investigated. So, I think it was just
those sheer emotions of this encounter that really prompted the witness to
report it. Uh, and I'm glad he did because people deserve to know about
these cases. Here's another one. Super interesting. Multiple witness case. I
call this one the ETS in the rain. This occurred in October of 1995 in
Breitburn, Germany. Again, a multiple witness case involving animal reactions
as well and some really interesting and unusual behavior on the part of the
ETSs. I do think these are ETSs given that they were standing right next to a
saucer-shaped craft covered with multicolored lights as we shall see. This case was published in a German
publication. You can see it here. It involves two witnesses, Carolyn and Veronica.

The two girls, 13 years old, were riding their horses in the rain along a path
through a forest in the bright Brun area of Germany. While riding, they came to a
crossroads where there was a 120 foot long path leading to a lower clearing in the forest. And it was there that the
witnesses saw colored lights at first looked to them like quote some kind of
circus event. So they approached closer and this is when they saw that it wasn't
a circus. In fact, the colored lights were attached to a gray craft. They said
it was shaped like a shallow plate or bowl with a dome on top. The perimeter
of the craft was encircled with multicolored lights, red, green, yellow, and blue. And standing next to it were
short little munchkin-like figures. 

It actually uses the word munchkin. Now, one of the little humanoids held up
a large pitchfoot leaf over his head, apparently using it like an umbrella,
presumably to shield him from the rain, which was coming down. At this point, the girls horses shied, and the girls
became frightened. The next thing they knew, the craft rose 15t up into the air and darted away so quickly, it looked to
them almost like it disappeared. Researchers later learned that multiple farmers in Oberdorf, which was less than
two miles away, also saw the craft depart. Now, one of the witnesses, Carolyn, says she has some memory gaps
and that there may be more to this event than she can consciously recall. I think it's significant that in this case, one
of the witnesses, Caroline, says that she has some memory gaps. It's a huge
red flag there. 

Whenever anyone is very close to a UFO, the chances of this
being a more extensive encounter, perhaps an onboard experience goes way
up. So, it's entirely possible this is more than just a sighting of a landed
UFO and a humanoid, but could be a onboard experience. Hard to say for
sure, but it's interesting to me that it wasn't just these two girls who saw this
UFO. There were multiple witnesses who saw this craft taking off. I've said it
before, but one person's sighting is often another person's onboard encounter. Not again, not sure that
that's what happened in this case, but it's certainly a possibility. Now, let's move to the last
and final case in this collection, which is super interesting and quite scary actually. Certainly for the witness. I
call this one charged by an alien. This occurred one evening in July of 2018 to
a young teenage witness. His age isn't described exactly, but that does appear
to be inferred in this case, which occurred in a rural area of Newego,
Michigan. It's a really unusual humanoid. Can't say I've heard one described quite like this. Does appear
perhaps to be a variation of the typical gray, but not typical by any means. As
we shall see, this case comes from researcher author Nathaniel Brlin and was published in his book Crawlers, a
conclusive case book. 

The witness's anonymous, I'll call him Jacob, that's a
pseudonym. It was around 7:30 p.m. one evening in July 2018 that he and his
family went to visit his grandparents who lived in a very rural area outside of Newego, Michigan. In fact, the
closest other house was more than a mile away. So, a very rural area. And on the
evening in question, Jacob was in front of the house hitting golf balls out into the pasture next to the house. After
hitting all the golf balls, he ventured out into the pasture to go collect them.
Now, the property was gated to keep the dogs contained. So, he went beyond the gate, closing it behind him. He
collected most of the balls in the pasture, but he knew that he had hit a few beyond the pasture and into the
forested area at the edge. So then he went to go collect those. It was then
that he heard footsteps among the leaves coming from behind him and also a weird sound which he said was kind of like
water dripping off of someone who had just stepped out of the shower. But the strange thing was the sound would start
and stop. So Jacob speculated that perhaps it was the wind blowing water from the leaves on the trees. Collecting
what he thought was the last golf ball, he turned and started to walk back. And
this is when he saw a tall figure step behind a tree. He only caught a brief
glimpse of movement. So he couldn't discern what it was at this point, but he knows he saw something, and very
curious, he remained still and intently watched the area where he had seen this
figure disappear. and his patience was rewarded because after just a few moments this figure came out from behind
the tree and to his amazement it was crawling out on all fours. 

He first saw its long skinny arms followed by his head. He could see that it had a large bald head, large dark round eyes, two
holes for a nose, a long slit for a mouth, a long exaggerated chin, and he
said it crawled completely out from behind the tree, at which point he was impressed by how skinny its arms and
legs were. It gave the creature an almost starved appearance. He said its
skin was dark and glistened with wetness. Its torso looked almost twisted
up and malformed. How he described it was like an unorganized mass of flesh.
Its hands and feet, he noticed, were much longer than a normal person's. It was at this point that this strange
creature turned and looked directly at Jacob. And this is when he noticed that
that strange watery sound that he had heard earlier was coming from this creature. And it seemed to be coming
from the being's nostril holes. Now, he was pretty close to this thing, about 75
ft away. Close enough. He said that he could see its nostrils flaring. At this
point, the being stood up, reaching a height of about 6 and 1/2 ft tall. He
said it moved its neck in a way that seemed unnatural, and again looked directly at the witness. Jacob remained
frozen to the spot and just stared in shock and fear when suddenly this creature did something totally
unexpected. It charged right at him, running right towards him. Jacob was too
stunned and surprised to react in any way. 

Just tried to prepare himself for this confrontation. But instead of
hitting him, this creature ran right by him through the woods and disappeared. Jacob turned and watched as it kept
running, and it alternated between running on all fours and on two feet. And again, Jacob had the impression that
this creature's body looked contorted, unnatural, and as he said, quote,
"Off." Now, he was afraid, as you can imagine. So, he ran out of the field back to the property, closed the gate
behind him, and at first he didn't tell his grandfather what he had seen, but later he did. And to his surprise, he
received confirmation because his grandfather said that he had seen this same creature before while walking
through the trails in the woods around the property. How weird is that? 

Can you imagine seeing the very tall, skinny, kind of misshapen being like that and have it run 
directly towards you? That would be scary, I think, for anybody. Uh, so another interesting case. 
Again, how many cases like this will it take for this subject to be fully accepted? We're all 
victims of the UFO coverup. Let's face it, our own governments have spent an enormous amount of 
time, money, and energy, our tax dollars, to explain away all of these cases, again, as hoaxes, 
hallucinations, misperceptions, and mental illness. All the while knowing that this is a real 
phenomenon. our governments, our secret governments, whatever you want to call it, the cabal, 
the military-industrial complex, the intelligence agencies, the highest levels of the military. 
I think these are the folks behind the cover up. They've known for decades that this is a real 
phenomena and are still covering it up. It's not only disingenuous and cruel, but I think it's 
a huge mistake. 

Truth and transparency is, I think, the best course of action with this subject. Sooner or later 
it's going to come out. So I it's a lost cause trying to cover up these encounters. It is moving 
into the mainstream. It's a new era for humanity as this subject grows in popularity and more and 
more people are accepting the reality that we are being visited by extraterrestrials and we are
not alone. So that's it for today. Thanks guys. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Perhaps learned 
something new. I always learn something new each time I do the research for these episodes. I 
work real hard at this as you know. Uh I think this is an important subject and if we could all 
just accept this subject, it would change the world and I think bring us all together. So yeah, 
thanks again. I really appreciate you guys watching and until next time, keep asking those 
questions, keep searching for the truth, keep having fun. I will see you next Friday. Bye for now.
