A CENTURY OF HUMANOIDS: TWELVE TRUE ENCOUNTERS
Feb 16, 2024

Summary:
Feb 16, 2024
ETs have been visiting humans for a very long time. Cases reach back hundreds of years and come from all over the world. Here is a collection of twelve accounts of humanoids of all different kinds from 1922 to 2023. Most of the cases involve multiple witnesses. Several involve physical evidence. The truth can no longer be denied. Earth appears to be just one countless inhabited planets in our universe. The evidence speaks for itself.

TWENTY ALIENS. In the summer of 1922, Irma Hinz and her boyfriend William O’Brien were walking home from a movie in Detroit, MI when they saw a disc-shaped object descend to treetop level and hover over a nearby tree. Staring down at them through a series of portholes were at least twenty bald figures with close-set eyes.

UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS. In the summer of 1933, three people drove to Tobin Lake in Nipawan, Saskatchewan, Canada to investigate the strange lights people had been seeing in the area. To their shock, they came upon a landed craft and a dozen humanoid figures. The humanoids appeared to be working on repairing the craft.

AN UNINVITED GUEST. As investigated by researcher Klas Svahn, on the night of May 18, 1946, beekeeper, Gosta Carlsson came upon a landed UFO outside of Skalderviksstranden, Sweden. Several male and female human-looking figures surrounded the craft. Gosta approached as close as he could, and watched until they returned inside and the craft departed. Later, he experienced telepathic contact with the ETs.

THE LAUGHING ALIEN. On the afternoon of Aug 14, 1951, a farmer approached a cemetery near his home town of Voghenza, Italy and saw a landed craft and six 4-foot-tall humanoids standing next to it. They wore shiny white jumpsuits and fishbowl helmets, and had monkey-like faces. One of them shot him with a ray of light. They then retreated into the craft, which took off, leaving behind strange landing traces.

THE GLOWING GREEN MEN. It was a stormy night in 1965, as a young couple drove their car along the A6 highway in Cumbria, England. Pulling over to rest, they noticed a glowing red dome-shaped object landed behind a brick wall. Standing in front of the wall were three humanoids glowing with a weird green color. They sped away in a panic.

A BIGFOOT-UFO ENCOUNTER. Around 10am, on Feb 22, 1976, the Hegele family was driving along Interstate 15 outside of Great Falls, Montana when they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid next to the highway. The father, Leonard Hegele stopped the car and pursued the creature, Then he saw a strange craft behind the creature. Soon other reports came in of Bigfoot-like creatures in the area.

THE ROBOT AND THE MONK. On the afternoon of Jul 11, 1978, two young boys were climbing trees near their homes in Ibiza, Spain when they were chased by a robot-like humanoid. Fleeing the area, they saw another strange humanoid wearing monk’s robes. They also saw a landed saucer. But then it released a blue orb which came at them. They ran home, with the blue orb following them most of the way.

HE WAS NOT HUMAN. On the night of Feb 13, 1980, a farmer went to check on his new farm-field outside of Rafaela, Argentina. As a strange silence settled around him, he saw a tall humanoid dressed in a white astronaut suit using a hose-like device to draw water from the river. The figure floated towards him, and moved through a thick hedge of thorn bushes. The bushes seemed to part before the figure.

THE CHILD-LIKE ETS. At noon on Dec 12, 1997, Janko Vrancic came upon a landed UFO and child-like humanoids in a field next to his farm outside Sibenik, Croatia. Having heard about aliens on TV, he approached them and offered them some of his lunch. They told him they weren’t hungry, then climbed into their craft, which quickly departed.

THE UFO IN THE BLACK CLOUD. On Sep 28, 2008, newlyweds Jim and Linda were enjoying a walk along the beach at Perdido Key, FL. Looking up, they noticed a weird black cloud accelerating towards them. Then it stopped about 150 feet overhead and began to light up. A craft appeared in the cloud, and in one of the portholes, he saw an alien staring down at him.

THE SKINNY GRAY. On the night of Jun 6, 2018, four people were in the woods outside of Siletz, OR. Suddenly one of them, a 12-year-old girl saw a skinny little gray staring at her from 100 feet away. She called out to the others, who didn’t see it. But over the next few minutes, it appeared two more times, but only to the girl.

A STARING CONTEST WITH AN ET. Around 4am on Jun 1, 2023, two garbage men were on their route near Mifflin, OH when they saw a tall, thin, gray-skinned skinny figure with large dark eyes staring at them from the woods a short distance away. One of the men walked towards it, and the figure bounded off into the trees and disappeared.

These cases are just a tiny sample of the huge number of humanoid cases on record. There are too many cases to ignore. ETs are visiting our planet.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal thank you very
much for joining me today I've got a very special episode I call this one A
Century of humanoids humanoids have been seen for a very long time and that's what I really
want to focus on today our cases reaching all the way back to the 1920s
right up through the 2020s so that's actually 110 years including
yeah a lot of humanoids seen all over the world I've got cases from Europe
cases from the United States from Canada and South America just all over the
planet and reaching back a long long time these of course involve a wide
variety of humanoids a wide variety of interactions with ETS lots of physical
evidence some really interesting multi P witness cases there are some cases that are quite brief but still really
interesting and others that are a bit more complicated and complex but all of them I think and I've
said this many times have something to contribute to our understanding of
extraterrestrial visitations uh it's always amazing to me that there are still Skeptics out there
because there are just so many darn cases in the first case I'd like to talk
about today I call 20 aliens this one occurred Way Way Back In
The Summer of 1922 in Detroit Michigan this wasn't a
fully investigated case though it was at least partially investigated by a
professional investigator and it's so interesting because it does have multiple Witnesses
it's a very close upsetting of a craft with humanoids inside of it and and yeah
it took place so long ago and that alone makes this case I think very significant
this case comes from researcher Dr Ron Westrom who received a letter from the
primary witness her name is Irma Hines and according to Irma she and her then
boyfriend William obrien were walking home from a movie in Detroit Michigan it
was around 10 p.m. as they were walking along draon Street this is located
between West Fort Street and West Jefferson Avenue there was a large
vacant lot alongside this Avenue the street there is now demolished but as
they were walking along Dron Street suddenly the sky lit up with light and
they watched this large dis shaped object descend to Treetop level at this
point it began to circle around a large tree the whole craft was rotating as it
did this they said this craft had rectangular Windows lining the bottom
perimeter of the desk and it was through these windows these Port holes that they observed
about 20 humanoid figures according to Irma these figures
appeared to be seated and they could only see the shoulders and heads but the
Figures were all baldheaded and had close set eyes and they were staring down intently
at the young couple now both Irma and William watched this for several minutes but became
frightened as they realized how unusual this was and they quickly hurried away
Irma immediately told her parents when she arrived home but her mother wondered
if Irma had perhaps experienced some kind of strange vision and it wasn't
until years later that she wrote to Dr Ron Westrom and shared her encounter now
Irma's daughter Carol Hines confirmed her mother's account and it turns out
that Irma's then boyfriend William O'Brien has not come forward with his
account and they were unable to locate him a really amazing case I can't
imagine what it would be like to see 20 ETS staring down at you from the port
hole of a craft that's hovering that low you can see that did make a very lasting
impression on the witness and I'm certainly glad she reported it to Ron Westrom who is a very well-respected
researcher and here's the next case I'd like to cover we're going up through the decades this was in the
1930s and I call this case a UFO lands for repairs this is an interesting case
because it occurred Way Way Back In The Summer of 19 33 in nipan Saskatchewan Canada and this
is a multiple witness case with at least four Witnesses and some corroborating surrounding Witnesses I also like this
case because it involves a landed craft there are landing traces to support this
it was viewed for a pretty long time and it's just an all-around fasinating case
involving humanoids this very early report of a landing and humanoids comes
from researcher John Brent Musgrave and it was again in the summer of
1933 quite some time ago that numerous reports began circulating among the
local homesteaders in the small town of nipawan of they were seeing strange lights I
mean not only in the sky but near the ground and many of them were near the
hin lake area some thought the lights might be explained as swamp gast because there
were lots of bogs and swamps in that area but other Witnesses were not convinced they thought it might be very
strange objects of some kind so one summer evening around midnight Two Men
and A woman decided to drive to the area where these lights were being seen and
as they did so they saw a strange light ahead of them unfortunately the road was
too rough so they exited their vehicle and began hiking through the woods towards this light and they hiked right
up to the edge of a very large bog and could not get any closer but they were
now close enough to see the source of this glowing light about A4 mile away they actually had a perfect
unobstructed view of what they described as a large saucer-shaped craft which was
resting on Landing legs they could see that it had a dome shaped top a door in
the center from which a ladderlike staircase extended down to the
ground the craft itself glowed bright quote unearthly orange and it was
lighting up the area all around it surrounding this craft were about a
dozen silver suited figures wearing helmets or caps of some kind and they
look slightly smaller than your average person about 5 ft tall and they appeared
to be scurrying around buily although in perfect silence all the witnesses did have the
impression that they were repairing this craft now the occupants did not appear
to notice that they were being observed by the witnesses and these Witnesses actually
watched this craft and the occupants for a long time about a half hour at one
point they thought about shouting out and trying to get their attention but instead they decided to get back to the
truck and see if they could find another Route Around The Bog and get a closer
look Unfortunately they got low on gas and had to return but it was a few
nights later during a full moon that they returned to the site and there was
nothing there but they waited until dawn and hiked up to this area were able to
get right to it and they were hoping to find evidence that there had been a
craft there and they found it all right they found six large large Square
imprints which they believe were the landing legs of this craft they said
each imprint was about 2 ft Square 2 to 3 in deep and they were spaced about 8
to 10 ft apart they also saw a depression in the vegetation in the
ground where the stair or ramp had apparently come down now in the center
of all of this was a burned Circle about 12 ft in diameter they didn't see any
actual Footprints but it did look as though the ground in this area had been
Disturbed they brought a camera with them they took photographs of this
imprint and afterwards they sent copies of these photographs along with their
story to several newspapers and magazines but to their disappointment no
none of the magazines were interested in the story so they kind of dropped it and
in fact it wasn't until 40 years later that they spoke with researcher John Brent Musgrave and shared their story
unfortunately by then they were unable to locate the photographs a truly
interesting case and what a shame that newspapers and journals at the time had no interest in the story it's even more
of a shame these photographs of the landing traces and alleged Footprints are no longer available or were not able
to be located CU that would bring this case to a whole new level but given that
it does involve four Witnesses and so many people in the area were seeing UFOs
I think it's a legit case and it's certainly interesting because while it is speculation that this UFO landed for
repairs this is something that does turn up in a number of cases in fact in a few
of the upcoming cases in this little collection we hear this so maybe that's
what was going on don't know for sure but absolutely
interesting and now we move to a really fascinating case probably one of the
most complex and perhaps interesting in this little collection I call this next
case an Uninvited Guest and by that it's the actual human who had this experience
that was apparently Uninvited or at least that was his perception on the other hand he also
feels like this this was something that was meant for him to experience this
this incident occurred on May 18 in 1946 this was well before UFOs were at
all popular and I'm probably going to butcher the place name but I'll do my best it's called scaler Vick stranden
Sweden and this may be one of Sweden's most famous contact cases it's certainly
pretty well known in the country I've heard of it here and there but I finally decided it was time to take a deeper
look at it because this is a case that didn't involve Landing traces
electromagnetic effects and affected the witness profoundly it absolutely
completely changed the course of his life as we shall see the main witness in
this case is gasta Carlson who at the time of his encounter was a 28-year-old
beekeeper and train dispatcher and a again this is arguably one of Sweden's
most famous humanoid cases and UFO Landings was on the evening of May 18
1946 as gasta was walking through a forest of birch and pine trees when he
noticed something strange up ahead on the path as he says in his own words at
the far end of the meadow just a few meters from a lonely Pine stands an
illuminated craft that I have never seen the like of either before or since my
first thought is that it's a funfair carousel that someone drove there somehow but I soon realized that it
would be impossible because no roads lead to the clearing so as he looks at this object
he can see that it's disc shaped and silver in color it was resting on the
ground he saw a hatch or a doorway was opened and a small ladder was extended
down to the ground this object had a small Dome on top with little oval Port
holes all around it you also have noticed a large antenna type device
which was sticking out from the top and the it was emitting the sort of Dome of
light around the entire craft and the area surrounding it now surrounding the craft and also
standing on top of its surface were several humanlike figures and asuga says
while looking at the craft I can't help but think that someone is trying to joke with me one thought that goes through my
head is that it may be German pilots who have escaped from some prison camp but
deep down I don't really believe it so remember this is just after World War II
so this was his mindset at the time gasta could smell an ozone like odor in
the air and looking at this craft he saw that this was very advanced advaned
there were no seams or rivets of any kind just one smooth piece of metal he
saw that these figures surrounding the craft were all wearing tight fitting
white sort of astronaut suits with blue black boots and belts but he did notice
that these suits had no zippers buttons or any markings of any kind they did go
over the head and there were transparent face plates so very much intrigued gasta
walked right up to the craft and as he says the strange thing was that everyone
turned to me when I entered the clearing it was as if I was an expected but not
welcome so as he approached he saw that these figures included both men and
women and most paid little attention to him and appeared to be very busy working
or repairing the craft was his impression again he says they were were human looking but he noticed that they
seem to be communicating without talking out loud and as he stepped even closer
the figure who was closest to him suddenly raised his hand in a gesture
which Goa clearly understood to mean stop do not Advance further and he
watched as they continued to work on this craft at one point he did see a
female figure exit the craft and start handing out cups of liquid for everyone
to drink he tried to step forward again but the guard again cautioned him to
stand back and as GAA says when I take a step
back everyone continues with their job and I feel mildly chagrined and
frustrated two of the girls smile so beautifully at me and I see their Sparkling White Teeth I can boast that I
am not usually afraid of anything and I have spent enough time in the woods and on the the ground not to believe in the
devil nor Trolls but this is weird very strange so he can see that these figures
are smiling and clearly happy and at peace this really struck him that they
seem to be a very tranquil people and then he saw one of the
figures take this weird flashing object and throw it on the ground as if
discarding it and in shock Goa decided at this point to back away from the
saucer and the figures and return to the trail to circle around and see if he can
approach from the other side but shortly after he does so he sees this craft rise
up into the air as he says in his own words slowly and majestically the heavy
craft Rises which I I can now see clearly it's almost like a balloon
Rising only there is a whistling sound as heard from a vacuum cleaner motor
so as he watched this craft rose to about 1,500 ft it then turned sideways
glowed bright red and then shot away at incredible speed Goa remained where he stood
because as he says he was quot quite overwhelmed and shaken this encounter really had a
profound effect on him again having just experienced World War II not long before
all this he again wondered if this craft could be a secret military craft but in
the next few years it turned out that the country of Sweden experienced this huge wave of ghost Rockets this was
ushering in the Modern Age of UFOs and he began to realize that his
experience was most likely involving extraterrestrials but after this
encounter he left the site and went home but he returned the very next day hoping
to find evidence and he did he says he immediately found a ring of burned
vegetation as well as depressions on the ground where this craft had rested he
said the ring was about 52 ft in diameter and the landing pod marks were
about 2T 9 in and he also found bootprints on the ground now here's
where the story gets even more interesting and somewhat controversial because he said he found something else
an actual ET artifact as he says in his own words
just as I was finished and about to go home I remembered the shiny object that the girl threw out I recalled the
location a small Mound near the curtain of light when I looked there I saw
something glistening in the grass and I picked up a shiny Rod of violet quartz
about 10 cm thick 13 cm wide that's 4 in by 5 in and about 30 cm long about a
foot he says it had beveled corners and was burnt and melted at one end about 30
cm or so away I found a small beautiful ring with a ring size of 17 and some
green metal and a beautiful stone in a frame and that's not all he says he also
found two of the cups left by the ETS some with some liquid still in it so he
collected these artifacts he says and kept them to himself not revealing them
to anyone it was 2 days after this encounter he says that he began having
Vivid realistic dreams which he quickly realized were more than dreams he
believed this was actual contact because in these dreams he saw one of the ETS
sitting in the pilot seat of The Craft you saw this very clearly and in this dream this ET spoke to him him and
saide I thought I would get in touch with you and explain what we were doing when you saw us over there in the
woods and the ET proceeded to explain to gasta that they had had an accident and
had to repair their craft so this was the first of many of
these dreamlike visitations where gas saw visions of the et's planet strange ET cities and in
fact he began to hold long conversations with them about all kinds of subjects
about Karma life after death reincarnation the origin of the universe
and much more the ETS told him that they had long ago moved Beyond war and
disease that they live many hundreds of years so as a result of all this years
later in 1953 gasta founded a company called
cernal which actually uses pure poen extract to develop an herbal
pharmaceutical for medicinal use according to gasta this substance can
slow down aging and he says he based it on the alien healing drink he found in
the alien cups so you can take that for what it's
worth in 2003 gasta did pass away from a stroke his artifacts and notes and all
his documentation of this incident have never been found though according to researcher Claus Swan he says that gasta
did in fact show the artifacts to him so in some ways it is a controversial case
but fact is goa's company sirell was very successful that is undeniable it
made him very wealthy and to this day there is a UFO Monument memorializing
G's encounter so what an interesting case that is I mean there aren't many cases
that have a monument memorializing a UFO incident and it's also interesting
because it is a very early case which predated the Modern Age of UFOs kind of
ushered in that era because it was just after gas's encounter that Sweden was
hit by a major wave of what we call ghost rockets and that was the first time that modern Society really began to
notice that we were being visited and it's a super fastc case in a lot of ways
with Landing traces parent artifacts electromagnetic effects the full length
book he wrote about his case and given the fact that G's company was so
successful I think that lends another level of credibility to his account it's
super interesting and now we move on to the next casee which is also equally
fascinating and I call this one the Laughing alien this is a really
interesting case which involves a landing and humanoids exiting the craft
humanoids that were quite short but looked very much like us and were
displaying emotions that we hear from normal people so it's that alone makes
this a super interesting case it occurred on August 14 1951 in Venza Italy this next case comes
from Italian researcher morito verga and it involves a farmer who wishes to
remain anonymous this farmer lived outside the very small town of Venza
located in Northern Italy and it was around 100 p.m. on August 14
1951 when this farmer saw a saucer-shaped object land in the open
field Fields next to the town's Cemetery which you can see here and the farmer approached to about
150 ft of this object in order to get a closer look at it and when he did he
could now see that this object he estimates was about 20 ft in diameter
was composed of a whitish aluminum sort of metallic looking metal and he saw a
series of bluish Port holes lining the circumference and there was a dome on
top so this is sort of your typical Flying Saucer says the craft itself sat
on Landing legs and he saw two stair-like structures extended from
either side down to the ground he was staring in amazement at this strange craft when he saw that
there were actually six strange men standing nearby seeming to examine the
cemetery with great curiosity they saw him and began to approach he says they
were pretty much human looking but each of them was very short only about 4T
tall they were all dressed in shiny white onepiece overalls with knee high
boots on their heads they wore round transparent sort of Fishbowl helmets
there were three antenna two on either side and one on top he says in the back
of their suits were cylinders connected to tubes which led to the helmets so he
had the impression these were breathing devices their suits had helmets with what looked like multicolored lenses
attached to them and each of these figures carried what the witness assumed
was some kind of weapon in one of their hands now he got a good look at them
these figures themselves had white skin and faces that were not quite human
almost looked monkey-like to him but their eyes were round and he said Azure
blue he said their arms were disproportionately long reaching down past their knees five of the figures he
said were clean shaven but one did have a reddish beard and as they approached
the witness he actually could hear them laughing now the bearded figure who was
closest to the farmer gestured towards him with what the farmer assumed was a greeting and he could see the others
communicating with hand gestures but they weren't making any other sounds other than this
laughter now suddenly one of the figures raised this object in his hand and
pointed it at the witness and the farmer suddenly realized he was being struck by
a dazzling white light he says it didn't paralyze him or really have any other
effect other than to Dazzle him briefly but it was at this point that the figures retreated to their craft
according to the farmer three entered the craft on the steps at one side and the other three used the steps on the
opposite side and he noticed that the figure with the beard was the last to enter the
craft now once inside the steps quickly retracted as did The Landing legs at the
same time this craft emitted a loud whooing noise which the farmers had
reminded him of a vacuum cleaner he saw a small nozzle type device appear on the
center underside of The Craft which emitted a reddish green flame at this
point the object Rose SW slowly stopped momentarily then tilted onto its side
and Streed away at high speed disappearing off into the distance below where this craft had
hovered the farmer now saw a 25 ft wide area of burned soil I love that case
because it's it occurred in broad daylight he saw these ETS in this craft from very close up I find it fascinating
that this craft landed right next to a cemetery because I did do a prior episode of UFOs hovering over cemeteries
Landing next to them humanoids walking among them they seem to be drawn to cemeteries for some reason that is a
whole other episode so if you want to take a look at the connection to cemeteries and graveyards you can
definitely look that up but this would be another case to add to that category
and that's another reason that I think it's a super interesting case and of course the landing traces and all that
as well but there's always another case that's what's so amazing about this
field is how many cases there are and the next case I'd like to talk about
today you probably haven't heard of it's not very well known at all I'd never
heard of it it but once I heard about it I thought wow this is super interesting
it's got some very interesting aspects to it so I did decided to include it in this little chronology and I call this
one the glowing green men and this one occurred in
1965 in Cumbria England the main Witnesses in this case are a young
couple with an infant son who were driving along very late at night and had one of the most interesting ing
experiences of their lives this next very unusual case comes from UFO
researcher and accomplished artist David sanki the Witnesses are a young couple
who insisted upon anonymity they're known only by Mr and Mrs C and they were
with their infant baby at the time of the encounter and as researcher David sanki writes neither of the couple have
spoken of this to anybody before I only found out because I am a friend of the
family I have to say this couple are totally straightforward and were in no
way under the influence of drink or drunks when this happened nor do they have any mental
problems so this encounter began on a winter night around 3:00 a.m. again in
1965 as the couple drove along the A6 Highway between the towns of Beaton and
mil Thorp in South Cumbria it was a very stormy night so they decided to pull off
the road and wait for better weather and shortly after pulling over this is when
they noticed a bright red light coming from behind a stone wall alongside the
road and looking at the source of this light they could very clearly see a
glowing red dome-shaped object sitting on the ground about 75 ft away from them
behind this wall the bottom part was obscured by the wall itself but they
could see the top half of it and right as soon as they noticed this they immediately saw three short
figures who were now standing in front of the wall and actually approaching their vehicle was strange because two of
them as they watched put their arms outstretched in front of them while one
of these figures kept its arms at its s they said that all three of these
figures had very large sort of turnip shaped heads large round staring eyes a
long trunk-like nose but just a slit for a mouth the witnesses couldn't tell if
these figures were wearing clothes or not but they did notice that these figures bodies seemed to Glow with a
slight green luminescence and they were quite close I mean these figures were only about 15 ft
from their car now they immediately became consumed
with fear and drove off and they said nothing they did not talk about it until
they reached the next town of mil Thorp which was just a short distance away now
later here's where it gets even stranger when being interviewed by David sanki
both Witnesses said that although they drove off in fear they both felt that
the Figures were friendly and they were a little bit embarrassed about their fear of this incident because this is so
strange both these Witnesses said that they recalled actually touching the
figures or didn't so much recall touching them but remembered what they felt like Mrs C said the touch of the
figures was nice pleasant while Mr C recall that they kind of felt like
rubber but it was weird because neither could we call actually touching the figures
physically now their infant son did not react though there are a few strange
endnotes to this case because it was 13 years later when the son was about 14
years old he was outside playing with friends when he and his friends all
observed a small spherical object dropped from the sky Glide towards them
then float away but shortly later it returned again as if observing the
children and then shot off into the distance at high speed and was gone so clearly not a balloon or anything
conventional children did feel like this object had an interest in
them turned out this teen did develop severe cancer and tests showed the
presence of radium in his body they can't be sure if this has any
connection to his encounters but thankfully the child did make a complete
recovery but again they still all insisted on complete anonymity as they feared what
other people might think about them if they went public with their encounter Here We Go Again a case that very nearly
didn't see the light of day that we would never have heard about if not for a series of fortuitous
circumstances the witnesses very nearly did not talk about it and they're still
Anonymous and probably haven't told anyone but those they fully trust so
we're lucky to hear about this case and the vast majority of cases we hear about
because I've said it a million times most people don't report their cases but that's especially true if it involves
humanoids missing time or an onboard encounter or any sort of extensive
encounter the bigger the more extensive the encounter the less likely I think a
person is to report it so that speaks volume when you consider how many people
have reported their encounters and how many cases there are like this next one which I wanted to include because it
illustrates a very strange aspect of UFO encounters and I call this one a Bigfoot
UFO encounter I did a whole episode on Bigfoot UFO encounters but here's
another one that I did not include at in that prior episode because I didn't know about it but it's a very well verified
case with multiple Witnesses a lot of surrounding encounters to support this
initial one this one occurred on February 22nd 1976 in Great Falls Montana and boy this
case is a doozy this next very interesting case occurred around 10 a.m.
again on February 22nd 1976 as 29-year-old Leonard heagle was
driving with his wife and there two children along Interstate 15 just
outside of Great Falls Montana and this is when they all saw
what appeared to be a Bigfoot walking right along the highway through a field about A4 mile from the road itself they
could see that this figure was huge about 7t tall they estimate with a 3ft
wide shoulder span and per Leonard it was walking in this weird nonhuman
manner he immediately pulled his car over exited the vehicle grabbed his gun and
pursued the creature on foot and he ran towards it approaching to about 7 or 800
ft when this creature turned around to face him and then he felt a little bit
different about chasing him because as Leonard says in his own words I was
carrying a 357 Magnum pistol but when he turned around I felt completely
defenseless according to Leonard this creature was quote solid and
muscular now I didn't get close enough to see if it was covered with hair or not but he did say that this creature
was very large walked with a huge stride length and its arms were swinging by its
side and as he says quote it was no human so now clearly frightened Leonard
decided to end his Chase and Retreat back to the car but before he did he noticed something
very strange a large gray oval-shaped object was hovering in the air just a
short distance beyond the Bigfoot and it was very low he estimates it was hovering only 10 ft above the ground but
it would periodically Ascend and descend in kind of a yo-yo fashion about 15 ft
in either direction and he was close enough that he could also hear a high pitched
sound so they left the area and end up reporting their sighting to sheriff
Captain Keith Wolverton who you can see here Keith as it turns out had been
receiving reports of Bigfoot on and off for a while in this area including one
day before Leonard hegel's sighting he received another a few months after
heagle sighting this was on April 4th then in mid July you got a report
from a woman driving along Interstate 15 from the city of M to Great Falls it was
around 5:30 a.m. she was 5 miles west of Great Falls when she saw this very large
creature which she estimates was 7 to 8T tall with quote very wide shoulders and
was standing right alongside the road in fact she stopped her car and watched it
for a good 4 minutes when it suddenly bounded off into the
Wilderness was just a few days later another report occurred on the evening of July
21st when four men saw two Bigfoot just east of the rainbow Dam on the south
side of the Missouri River and per Captain Keith W Wolverton was the sixth
report of this big foot type creature in 1975 alone but it was only Leonard
heagles citing that it involved Bigfoot however Captain Keith Wolverton
reports his own sighting which occurred on the evening of November 11 that same
year uh he and his Deputy were driving from Missoula to Great Falls when a very
large orange light descended and traveled at incredible speed in fact it
passed directly over his Cruiser at a height of only 200 F feet as officer
Wolverton says it went from Horizon to Horizon in 4 seconds it was impossible to determine
its size or shape in the brief time we saw it now he did report it to officials at
Malmstrom Air Force Base and learned from his co-employee Sheriff Pete Howard
pictured here Pete Howard actually interviewed the witnesses that turned out earlier that day a B52 bomber was
flying over freeze out Lake when a strange object began pacing the aircraft
and get this suddenly this object approached the plane briefly attached
itself to the plane itself then detached itself and climbed out of sight was very
strange cuz when this object physically touched the plane the plane's radar equipment completely failed and remember
malstrom Air Force Space has a long history of very dramatic sightings how interesting is that that there are so so
many encounters with Bigfoot and UFO going on in the same area know most of
these cases these two phenomena didn't intersect in that one case they did
which makes it clear there is a connection there it's very hard to say what it is some people think that
Bigfoot might be an ET I considered that possibility but now having examined a
lot of cases like this I honestly think that Bigfoot and Sasquatch are sensient
intelligent beings and psychic as well and probably
are in contact with ETS much in the same way that humans are so I know how this
must sound to a skeptic but yeah I think the connection is is that some Bigfoot
are UFO contactees I don't know that's pure speculation but that does appear to be
what's going on hopefully more research and more cases on this particular aspect of ufone
Conners will bring more answers now moving along Through The
Years here is another case which is super interesting quite unusual it does
involve multiple Witnesses and Landing traces and I call this one the robot and
the monk this is not a super well-known case but it is pretty well verified in
terms of being researched it occurred on July 11 1978 outside of the T small town of iiza
Spain this case was originally reported solely in a Spanish newspaper but was
then published by researcher AER heenez in his Spanish book UFO
encounters with around 1 p.m as two children known only by their initials ab
and FC they were age 10 and 11 respectively these two kids were playing
in a farm field near the town of iiza Spain this is located on an island off
the coast of Spain and they were climbing in a carab tree when they heard this strange noise now they first
thought it might be an animal of some kind so they climbed down to investigate
and this is when they saw a very Strang looking sort of 6foot tall robotic
figure they said it was shiny silver in color humanoid in shape with a flattened
head the front part of its face showed only two vertical slits where the eyes would be I also saw the back side of it
and the back of the head showed this weird sort of small Hollow Circle from
which emerged two rods or sort of antenna like objects now suddenly this robotic figure
which not only looked strange it began moving very strangely moving towards the children in Long loping
jumps this caused them to completely Panic the two kids immediately fled
running towards a fence upon reaching the fence they quickly turned around to see if this figure was still following
them and they now saw a second figure which was standing near the first one
and this second figure looked different it appeared to be humanoid but it was wearing what looked like a long white
robe which had two vertical black stripes on the front of the Torso
they said that this figure had long black hair and what looked like a beard and in the center of the chest was what
looked like a star-like symbol this figure was about 6 feet tall they estimate but they could see its robe
sort of waving in the wind and this was when they noticed something else a very
large object parked in a field a short distance away and as they watched this
object Rose upwards it emitted a blue orb which began to move towards them so
when this happened the two children ran and they said that they were actually chased quite a long distance down the
street by this blue light that chased them most of the way home they said but
upon arriving home this blue light was gone the two kids immediately told their fathers what they had seen so their
fathers the kids a whole group of people returned to the site of the encounter
and when they arrived unfortunately the UFO and the strange Figures were gone but after searching the ground they
allegedly found a 50t wide triangular area of crushed grass with three circles
inside it it's just one case after another there are so so many interesting
cases and that one is super fascinating while the Witnesses were very young uh I
think the fact that there's two of them and that they were so emotional about what happened to them that there were
Landing traces found I think it's a legit case but definitely involving very
unusual ETS and now we move to the next case and
this one I call he was not human this one occurred on February 13
1980 in the town of Estancia Raphael and this is in Santa Fe
Argentina this is a super fascinating case cuz I think it speaks as to why
some ETS land and wander around because it looks to me in this case the ET was
studying the effects of the environment which is very interesting because that's
exactly what the witness himself was doing this very interesting case was
reported on by Albert Rosales in his book humanoid encounters but was originally investigated by the
Argentinian UFO study group OS e the witness in this case has
requested complete anonymity he is known only by his initials
CS this case took place on February 13 1980 in the small village of Estancia
again in Argentina Mr CRS had recently acquired the property rights to a field which he
planned to use to farm and raise livestock however there was an issue
this property bordered the Prussian River and a large amount of industrial
waste from an upstream Tannery and explosives Factory was known to pollute
this River so Mr CRS brought the landowner
the owner of the property and a veterinarian to check on the property to make sure it was okay to
farm and to get to the property which was quite isolated they had to walk
through a thick forest area area there was also a border of thick Thorn bushes
which was almost impenetrable so after all three of them got there the landowner went to check on
the fences to make sure that they were good while the veterinarian went to examine the river the main witness Mr
CRS was kind of tired so he decided he would just wait at the property and it
was around 15 minutes in the a in the afternoon right afternoon actually as
the witness Mr CRS sat down and was drinking some water when he noticed a
strange figure approaching from the stream this figure was about 75 ft away
right next to the stream and this figure he noticed immediately looked very
strange so Mr CRS got up walked a few steps closer to approach the figure and
this is when he realized that this figure was not human he said it was dressed in a metallic white suit kind of
reminding him of a fencer but this suit had three metallic rings at all the
joints the neck the elbows the waist and the knees the suit went up over the head
of the figure without covering the face the main witness could not quite see the
face he couldn't make it out he did notice that the figure wore a large backpack which reminded him of the an
astronaut suit now at this point he had only a side view of this figure but he
could see that this figure was holding a hosik device similar in appearance to sort of a golf club was in its right H
right hand and this figure was bending down to stick the lower end of this device into the stream apparently to
collect water that was certainly the impression CRS got but after doing so
this hosik device retracted and was gone from View and it was at this point point that the being turned to its right
facing CRS in a quote mechanical movement and he began to walk towards
CRS in smooth springing steps in fact it
looked to the witness as if this figure was actually floating and as he watched he saw that
the grasp was flattening out in front of the figure as if there was some sort of force field surrounding it this strange
figure approached the witness to a distance of about 30 ft and it was at
this point that the witness found himself unable to move but at the same
time he says he was overwhelmed by this powerful feeling of quote perfect peace
and Harmony he also noticed that there was an unnatural silence pervading
enveloping the whole area now Mr CRS was amazed because this
figure did did not appear to take any notice of him whatsoever and even as this figure got
close he still couldn't see any face and he was even more astonished
when this figure walked right up to the thorn bushes bordering the field and walked right through them in fact it
seemed as though the thorn bushes sort of opened up to allow the figure to move forward again this strange sort of force
field the strange figure disappeared off into the bushes and was gone so a short time later the other two
men the property owner and the veterinarian returned and without saying
anything about his experience Mr CRS asked both both of them if they had seen
anything strange the landowner said that yes he had didn't see anything but he did
notice an odd Eerie silence surrounding the area the veterinarian however did see
something he agreed about the strange Eerie silence but says that he also
noticed animals of all kinds were running in a complete Panic to the South
away from the field where this figure had been so this is a good animal reaction case and it turned out there's
an interesting sort of prequel to all of this because it was only a few months earlier in October of
1979 that this farmer Mr CRS and the same two men were in this field this was
prior to him actually acquiring use of the property and they had all gone to inspect it and this is when all three of
them saw this silver sphere floating in the daylight sky so apparently this was connected to
the following encounter hard to say for sure but certainly very interesting a
really interesting case and a lot to learn from it I think this is a case like I said earlier that does speak to
the et's concern about the environment another thing I found fascinating about this case is something
I've heard before when other people make contact with ETS is they feel this
overwhelming SE sense of peace and Tranquility there's something about
being very close to these guys that appears to bring on these really amazing
feelings it's also interesting that the ET really didn't pay much attention to the witness that the ET seemed to have a
job to do and was going to do it and off he went on his merry way but yeah a
super interesting case for a lot of reasons and now we move to the next case
this one is also really interesting it's quite brief but I think definitely worthy of attention this one I call the
childlike ETS and it occurred on December 12
1997 and this was in Croatia in a little little area called I'm not going to be
able to pronounce this sevo cber
Croatia and it's just a super fascinating case of a UFO landing little
ETS getting out and a Gentleman having a very close encounter and interaction
with them big thanks again to Albert Rosales author of humanoid encounters
for bringing this next case to light of a very interesting landing and humanoid
this occurred on a small farm again on December 12th
1997 this is located in seral jao located outside of cben
Croatia the sole witness is a farmer by the name of yonko ransik who was described by his friends
and neighbors as honest and down to earth and it was around noon as yonko
was hurting his cattle and he saw this metallic sort of iron shaped object
approaching from the southeast as it came close yonko could
hear that this object made a quiet humming noise and then as he watched it proceeded to land in a nearby Field very
close to him as he watched four slender childlike figures emerged from the
object Yano had heard about UFOs and ETS by watching them on television so he had
no fear of them and he quickly approached and actually offered to share his lunch which was
composed of figs and ham he says the ETS replied in sort of broken croation that
they were not hungry and it was after about 4 minutes these little figures quickly returned
back into the craft the humming noise began again and the craft took off
towards the Northwest and was gone yeah a very brief case and not super well
researched I mean I don't have any other information on it but so fascinating of
this farmer just walking right up to this landed UFO and offering his lunch I
don't know if how you know other people would react that way but he felt no fear
it was a very benevolent encounter and so interesting and now we move on to the
next encounter which I call the UFO in the black cloud this is a really
interesting case I think it shows some really interesting aspects to UFOs and
how they can remain hidden it's one of the reasons I wanted to include it this one occurred on September
28th 2008 in perido Key Florida the main
witness in this case is a gentleman known only as Jim a 57-year-old retired
marine and he reported his experience to muon it's case number
57018 and Jim and his fiance Linda had just married and they were on their
honeymoon at perido Key this is just a 16m long Barrier Island West of
Pensacola in Florida as you can see pictured here they were staying in some
Condominiums and it was a beautiful day the sky was blue with a few white puffy clouds as Jim and Linda were taking a
walk alongside this beach and looking up Jim noticed this
strange black cloud that seemed out of place it was a strange dark color he had
never really seen before it was quite small and as he watched it was actually
moving in their Direction and it became clear to him that this wasn't a cloud or
certainly not a normal Cloud because it accelerated and then stopped and this was just about 150 ft above in front of
them both and as he looked up at it it suddenly flashed a bright light that lit
up the cloud for 10 seconds and this is when he noticed something really amazing
he could see a dull gray spherical craft lined with illuminated Port holes and to
his shock he could see the silhouette of a strange being looking down at him from
one of the port holes he said that this object or that this figure was quote not
hugee about the size of a 14 or 15-year-old kind of skinny and dark but
not black he couldn't see any details of its face just the silhouette but as he
says I have to be honest I was really scared so after about 10 seconds This
Cloud turned completely black again and thoroughly frightened by the sight of this thing Jim turned to his wife Linda
and and said let's get out of here he didn't point it out to her because he didn't want to frighten her
instead he just grabbed her hand and together they ran away down the beach away from the black cloud he glanced
back at one point and saw that this Cloud was now moving back over the gulf
and as they exited the beach he looked down to wash the sand off of his feet and looking back the black cloud was now
completely gone which seemed odd for it to completely disappear so quickly and
this is when his wife Linda said what's wrong what was that black cloud now Jim
hadn't realized at that point that she had seen it too turned out she didn't see the craft itself but she did notice
this weird black cloud and he told her I think it was a UFO that is I think a
really kind of spooky case can only imagine what it must be like to see this black cloud floating towards you and
then starts lighting up inside this cloud is a UFO with an ET
looking down at you I wonder if there's deeper levels of contact here because
it's pretty unusual for a person to see a UFO that close up and a humanoid
looking down at them there's no indication that this gentleman the primary witness had further
encounters but again it's he had his wife with him so she while she didn't
see the UFO she did see the cloud and she could see that he was shook up a little bit it's an interesting case and
now we move to another one this these are much more recent cases some of you
out there have been asking me to cover more recent cases so I've been looking into it and they're a little bit harder
to find some times takes people a long time to report their encounters I think
that's one of the reasons there does also appear to be somewhat of a drop off
of what I would call you know face Toof face encounters with humanoids or onboard experiences or direct contact I
think there might be a number of reasons for that but at any rate there certainly are modern recent cases and this is one
of them which is super fascinating I call this one the skinny gray this
occurred on June 6 2018 outside of the small town of silets
Oregon and while there really is only one witness who saw the ET
itself uh her family did witness some of the symptoms or signs surrounding this
encounter such as you know Eerie silence and buzzing noises and things like this so there is
some corroboration for this sighting of a very closeup encounter with a humanoid
this multi- witness humanoid encounter comes from from muon researcher Ron Wright who actually heard about it the
day it occurred as it turns out his wife's son's girlfriend's daughter was
the witness and they reported it about 11 days after it happened to the National
UFO Reporting Center New Fork the main witness is a 12-year-old Anonymous girl
on the evening of June 6 2018 she along with her mom and her mom's boyfriend and
her younger sister had traveled about 5 miles outside of the small town of
silets Oregon they had plans to find some wood to construct a homemade bow it
was about 7:30 p.m. again 5 miles Southeast of silets and they were driving along ojala
Road into the woods they took a little Gravel Road off of
oala and then they stopped the car because Jay the boyfriend went to go go
collect some wood for a fire and while sitting in the backseat of the car waiting the young girl the
witness heard this faint buzzing noise which she first passed off as an insect
in fact everyone in the car heard this buzzing noise but she looked outside of the car and saw something she'll never
forget and as she says in her own words then out of the corner of my eye I saw
the most bizarre thing ever it was a about 100 to 120 ft away from my mom's
car what I saw was a human looking creature that was about four to 5 feet
tall with pale gray skin its skin was so thin it was almost transparent and it
was so skinny when I made eye contact with it everything went silent the birds
stopped chirping everything was silent then it ran away I saw it for about 10
seconds so yeah this creature this figure was about 100 feet away she said she was
close enough to see that it had large dark brown eyes an oval-shaped head no
visible ears just a small bump for a nose and it did not appear to be wearing
any clothes that she could tell but she said it was so skinny she could actually see Its Ribs she immediately told her
mom and Jay who said that they would keep an eye out for it and it was just a
short time later that this creature returned as the witness says then I saw
it again I knew something was up there and as I said previously it ran away but
it looked like it came from behind the stump it was standing by I said hey I
saw it again I think we should go up there and look around so they did as a
witness says we went up there and looked around and then while I was standing where I saw it the first time I saw it
again it moved so quick when I saw it and for moving so quick it was
incredibly quiet I yelled for Jay I saw it again so we went over to where I saw
it the third time and when we were talking it got really quiet and our voices echoed a lot more than the other
places in the woods so they walked over to where this being had stood and found what looked
like toughs of rabbit fur on this sort of stump they said this rabbit first
stunk real badly they searched for tracks but couldn't find anything the
soil was quite hard in the area so that's not too surprising but then they returned home so the second time this
witness saw this being she said it was visible for about 12 seconds and when
the being left the sounds returned to normal all the birds started chirping loudly as they had before this
encounter and as Ron wri the researcher says I spoke with the primary witness
this 12-year-old girl she was very sharp and sincere about what she saw that
evening I do not think this was a fabricated fantasy as I could sense the
fright and excitement in this young girl's voice which led me to believe it did
happen so again while the other Witnesses didn't see the creature they
all did hear the weird buzzing noise and they also noticed the strange
silence and the echoing as well so this is a multiple witness encounter although
only one witness saw the humanoid what I like about this case is that she saw
this gray three times right in a row it was reported on the day of the encounter
to a professional investigator so that is quite unusual often
researchers when they finally hear about a case days weeks months or even years have
gone by so the recollection of the witness is very fresh in this case and
she was able to describe what she saw in great detail and I love it when a witness can
make an actual sketch of what they saw so that also makes this case worthy of
study and super interesting and now we move to the last
case of the bunch this one one is super interesting just because it's so darn
recent this occurred on June 1st 2023 in Mifflin Ohio and I call this
case a staring contest with an ET and what's so interesting is this is
the sort of thing that does happen quite a bit people report this where their gazes well lock with an ET and it goes
on for an undetermined period of time so also an interesting case because there
was another witness it's a very unusual type of ET if that's what it was there
was no actual UFO seen in this case so that does raise questions about the
origins of this humanoid but he saw close enough and long enough the primary witness that I
think he saw something very unusual and I think it's worthy of
taking a closer look at this brief but very recent case was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center New Fork
it was about 4 to 4:30 a.m. again June 1st 2023 as two garbage men were
collecting trash along their route on the back roads between Mifflin and Lexington
Ohio there's quite a lot of woods in this area and as the witness says in his
own words it was a dark wooded area I was collecting trash cans when a tall
humanlike figure with a long neck a broad upper body a slender waist and
long legs and long arms peaked at me we had maybe a 15c stare off we never broke
eye contact it hunched over still looking at me it was about 7 to 8 feet
hunched over I started walking to it and it took off running into the woods
I got back into the work truck locked the door and drove up to get a closer look but it was gone too far in the
woods it had pale skin black circular eyes and moved like a human it was aware
that it was noticed by me it could run very fast and didn't want to be
noticed so this was a very brief encounter the witness estimates that the
entire incident lasted only about about 30 seconds but he wasn't the only one
who saw it his co-workers saw it too and to his credit 20 days after the incident
he reported his encounter to the National UFO Reporting Center definitely
a very strange humanoid and kudos to the witness for Having the courage to report it to the National UFO Reporting Center
I wish everyone did we'd have a much clearer picture of what's going on here but enough half that I think we do have
a pretty clear idea of what's going on we are being visited and we have been
visited for a very long time as these cases show reaching all the way back to
the 1920s all the way up to the 2020s goes to show this is an ongoing
thing that Humanity has been visited far longer than that I think but definitely
at least that far back in terms of humanoids and people being regularly
visited by them what's so fascinating about collections like these is it really speaks to the wide variety of
humanoids people see whether they're short little guys Grays tall lanky
humanoids human looking ETS short little humanoid looking ETS robotic beings I
mean you name it it's out there so this is just an extraordinary interesting and
enigmatic facet to UFO en coners so many cases of Landings too these objects
these craft I think that's what they are are landing on the ground and leaving
traces so people talk about this being an interdimensional or spiritual phenomenon I don't think so with people
you know getting implants these objects leaving Landing traces being photographed it's clear they're physical
so I think there still is a lot to learn about ET contact it's one of the reasons
I do this research I know a lot of you out there have had encounters like these
and it's comforting to know that there are other people who've had these same
experiences so that's it for today I really want to thank you once again for
watching I truly appreciate it and like I always like to say at the end of each
episode keep searching for the TR truth it's out there keep asking those hard questions because the answers will come
and most of all keep having fun because that's why we're here love you all and I
will see you next time.
