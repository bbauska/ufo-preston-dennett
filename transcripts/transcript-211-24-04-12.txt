FIVE FASCINATING ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
Apr 12, 2024

Summary:
Apr 12, 2024
UFO sightings, landings and face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials are all undeniably interesting. But perhaps the most extraordinary of all UFO encounters are cases where people have been taken onboard a craft. These cases leave little room for misperception or denial. They represent the cutting edge of UFO research, and make it very clear that we are not alone. This video presents five extensive onboard UFO encounters from across the world. Three of these cases involve multiple witnesses. All of them have physical evidence. But most important, these five cases show what it’s like to have an onboard UFO encounter and interact directly with ETs.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF PROFESSOR JOAO DE FREITAS GUIMARAES. On the night of July 16, 1956, Joao de Freitas Guimaraes was taking a walk along the beach in San Sebastiao, Brazil. Sitting down to rest, he was shocked to see a craft emerge from the ocean, fly towards him, and land on the beach. Two human-looking figures wearing jumpsuits emerged and invited him onboard the craft. Inside, Joao was amazed to see how advanced the craft was. Looking out a porthole, he saw the craft zoom into outer space. The ETs warned him about humanity’s savage nature and use of atomic weapons. They promised to meet him again and returned him to the beach. At first Joao kept his experience a secret, but word leaked out to the press and Joao’s story was published widely in newspapers. And soon he would have another encounter.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS OF LYDIA STALNAKER. In 1955, at age 9, Lydia Stalnaker and her two siblings walked near their home in Jacksonville, Florida. Suddenly there was a flash of light and a strange man began to approach. They ran home in fear. Lydia didn’t realize it, but she had been taken onboard a UFO. Later in 1974, Lydia (now age 28) drove outside Jacksonville and saw a UFO land near the highway. She and another man pulled over. They drove together to get a closer look, and suddenly Lydia lost consciousness. When a third missing-time UFO sighting occurred, Lydia sought hypnosis. She learned that she had been taken onboard UFOs three times, meeting grays and other humanoids. They warned her that Earth was facing future catastrophes. Lydia began exhibiting psychic abilities, and before long, was taken onboard again!

THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF JOE, CAROL & LUKE. On the night of June 20, 1976, a couple and their infant son were driving near Goodland, Kansas when they saw multiple UFOs. After watching them and talking about how interesting it might be to be taken onboard, one of the craft swooped over their car. The couple suddenly realized that their car was now five miles further ahead down the road, and they were missing hours of time. They also found strange marks on their body. Later, under hypnosis, they recalled that they were taken onboard by friendly ETs. They were separated and given physical exams. The husband experienced a profound spiritual event. All three were then returned to their car with little memory of the event. Ultimately, they were profoundly changed in a positive way by their encounter.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MYRIAM & SONIA. While driving through Bayamon, Puerto Rico, Myriam X and her mother Sonia were shocked when darkness enveloped them, surrounded by intense light and a period of missing time. Suddenly they were 45 miles away in Arecibo. Myriam and Sonia (both who had been ill) now found themselves miraculously healed. Years later, under hypnosis, they recalled that a UFO had appeared over their car. The craft pulled them and their car into the craft, where they met grays and human-looking ETs. They were separated, given exams, and healed. Both were also given information about the ETs, their agenda on Earth, and much more. They then had a profound reunion with deceased loved ones. They were then returned to their car.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF FERNANDO X. One evening in autumn of 1986, a young electrician by the name of Fernando was riding his motorcycle outside of Calleredo, Spain when he saw multiple UFOs overhead. When one of them zoomed towards him, Fernando jumped on his motorcycle to escape. But the engine wouldn’t work. Fernando watched in awe as the UFO floated a few feet off the ground. Two gray aliens emerged and pulled him onboard. Fernando was placed on a table with a bright light overhead, while the ETs examined him. Shortly later he fell asleep, waking up to find himself lying next to his motorcycle. The UFO and ETs were gone, and three hours had passed. Fernando rushed home where he found a strange mark on his body.

These five cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many researchers believe these cases might number in the millions. These cases provide incontrovertible evidence of onboard UFO encounters. The time has come for truth and transparency on this subject. There are too many cases to ignore; we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs and the Paranormal today's episode
is called five fascinating onboard UFO encounters I've said it many times every
encounter I think has something to offer us even if it's a simple sighting and of
course face-to-face encounters with humanoids are super interesting but I have to say my favorite are onboard
encounters there's almost no chance of misperception involved in these cases the person is not just seeing UFOs face
to face or having a sighting they are lit literally enveloped by the UFO
phenomena this is something that they can see feel hear taste all of it so
these are very important cases these are the cases that really have the most to
offer Us in terms of understanding what ET contact is like the ET agenda why
they're here and so forth so yeah I love these cases I've got five that I've
chosen for you today uh reaching all over the world so I've got a case from
Puerto Rico one from Spain one from Brazil two from the United States and
these are all cases which have some really interesting evidence to them as well different types of ETS they reach
back to the 1950s and move forward several decades I'm going to start with the early one and move forward in time
and I hope you find them quite interesting because these are not super well-known cases in fact you might not
have heard of them at all we will see let's get started the first case I want
to talk about today I call the onboard Encounter of Professor Xiao de frus
garez this is a super interesting case because this is a witness who is really
unimpeachable he's a professor he a lawyer he's a very intelligent person he
bravely stepped forward not particularly voluntarily but after his story was
leaked out after he shared it with some friends and I think you'll find it quite compelling it took place on July 16
1956 in San sebastio and this is in Brazil now there does appear to be some
minor confusion about the exact date of this encounter but it was either June 16
1956 or July 16 I'm thinking July 16 in
any case the main witness is Xiao de frus garez again a well-known respected
and successful attorney and professor and it was around 7:15 p.m. on the
evening in question that Xiao was taking a walk along the beach in south sebastio
as you can see here this is when he set sat down on the sand and was just
looking out over the stretch of water towards Ella Island and this is when he
noticed a change over a certain section of ocean now this was a dark overcast
evening and then in this one section of water it suddenly became kind of clear
and this is when without warning a jet of water which he likened to a water
spout appeared in that exact area for a second he thought it might be a whale
but moments later he changed his mind because a strange craft emerged from the
water and immediately began to approach him he said it was kind of disc shaped
or as he said a potbellied machine and it moved right towards him and in
moments it came right up to him now he was too frightened to run but he stood
up and watched as this craft lowered down extruding these sort of spherical landing pad ODS and came to rest
directly on the beach immediately a door opened and two tall figures
emerged now looking at them he says he wasn't sure if they were men or women
but they were tall fair skin with no wrinkles on their skin long blonde hair
and eyes that he described as quote light colored and tranquil both were
wearing one piece green jumpsuits and they walked right up to
him and Xiao now seeing their beautiful appearance felt his fear leaving him and
speaking Portuguese his native language Xiao asked them if they had suffered some kind of accident or if they were
looking for someone now they didn't answer so he repeated his question first in English then in French and then in
Italian and at this point the figures began to gesture for him to come on
board and at the same time he felt like they were inviting him on board
telepathically he got a really strong mental impression one of the figures turned and began walking towards the
ship and Ja felt like they wanted him to follow and he was intensely curious to
see the inside of this strange machine so he followed the first figure walked inside Xiao followed and the second
figure came in right behind him now inside there was a third figure Xiao
says that the interior of the craft was very brightly lit soon as he got inside
the door closed he saw Port holes and he went and he looked out the port holes on
the side of the craft and he could see that they were immediately taking off
there were some circular seats in the center of the room so he sat down at
this point he started to feel a little bit unwell he said he felt some pain and
coldness in his arms and legs which he attributed actually to just nervous
tension he admits he's a slightly nervous guy but looking out this port hole he was surprised to see rain
droplets suddenly hitting the window it hadn't been raining previously so this confused him a little bit and he asked
them is it raining and they spoke to him telepathically and said no that this
wasn't rain but it was the rotation of their craft that was causing moisture to
appear and Xiao still looking out the window and started seeing some really interesting things as he says in his own
words I noticed that at a certain point in the Journey Through the Windows we
passed through an intensely dark area in which the Stars Shone
extraordinarily followed by regions swarmed with stars new black areas
followed until we crossed a brilliant Violet layer when the device suffered
strong shocks so he could feel a little bit of shaking in the craft and he felt
some fear because of this and the being immediately replied again telepathically
the device has just left the atmosphere on your planet so xia was amazed looking
around he could see that there were other compartments or rooms in the room where he was he did see a strange device
which he said was kind of like a circular device with three moving needles and as they were leaving the
atmosphere and the craft started shaking these needles began to vibrate intensely
now the beings noticed his interest and explained that the craft was being propelled forward along the magnetic
field lines of our planet and that the instrument he was looking at measured that now through the windows at some
point he saw all kinds of things which he had difficulty describing uh various astronomical
bodies of different colors iridescent clouds at one point other things he found difficult to describe particularly
the technology he saw inside the craft he said it was totally Beyond his
comprehension and that when people asked him about it he's like you know I don't know what to tell you I didn't
understand it now he did ask these beings where they came from but they didn't answer however they showed him 12
constellations kind of making up the Zodiac and told him that they desired to contact him again one year later they
gave him an exact date August 12 1957 and he also had the impression that
the ETS were warning him of the various dangers threatening Humanity
particularly Humanity's Savage nature and the indiscriminant use of atomic
weapons which they said would have disastrous effects upon the Earth's atmosphere and its ability to protect us
from cosmic radiation so this was a pretty quick experience it went by fairly quickly and
before he knew it the trip was over the craft landed he was returned to the spot
where he was taken he did notice that his watch stopped as soon as he went on board and he learned later that about 40
minutes had elapsed and at first I mean he went home he told nobody but his wife however this
experience really consumed him and as the months passed he was still thinking
about it and he decided to share it with a few colleagues and soon the story leaked out to the press and Xiao found
himself being besieged by reporters in fact his account did appear in several
newspapers and when it was learned that the ETS were planning to return on August 12 for a return visit Xiao was
actually approached by a friend and told not to go as he had learned that the
Brazilian government were planning to intercept any craft with Air Force jets
and not wanting to put the ETS in any Jeopardy because he felt they were very friendly Xiao decided not to go to the
area for this second meaning however he did report another encounter in June of 1985 at Gonzaga
which is near the same area and he said again he was walking on the beach when a
large oval-shaped craft landed a door opened and this time four humanoids
stepped out and they were different looking from the human looking ones he saw initially he says they were tall but
had bald heads and wore skintight silver jumpsuits two of the four approached
Xiao two remained back he noticed immediately that they had their arms crossed over their chests in kind of a
weird way and he asked him why they were doing that and they told him apparently
telepathically that the energy that they exuded could be harmful to humans and
that was essentially it or at least that's all Xiao shared because he says
the beings at this point just turned around climbed back on board and the craft took
off now Xiao said he was interviewed by high ranking officials from the
Brazilian military who showed great interest in his case and he was also
shown photographs of some UFOs some very well known photographs including the
famous Trinidad Island phot photographs and he was really impressed by those because he said they showed what was
pretty much the same craft he had seen and been taken on board what an
interesting case that is for so many reasons I mean the fact that he saw this object coming out of the water I find
that fascinating the appearance of the ETS being pretty much perfectly human is
also really interesting they promised to visit him again which he didn't do out
of fear for the ET themselves the warnings they gave him the messages this all aligns to what so
many other people have reported it's a super fascinating case and I think an
important one which is why I wanted to include it in this episode and now we move to another case
which is not super welln but certainly got a lot of attention at the time and I
call this one the onboard Encounters of Lydia stal Necker and she began having
experiences as a very young girl so actually this is quite a few encounters
that she experienced throughout the 1950s up through the 1970s primarily in Jacksonville Florida
but her case is super interesting it's been very well researched by professional researchers there are
outside witnesses there are some very interesting physiological effects and even more interesting to me are the
psychic psychic effects as we shall see this case is again very complex quite
extensive involving multiple Witnesses but does center around a Jacksonville Florida woman by the name of Lydia
staler her case was investigated by James Harter PhD a very well-respected
researcher one of the few scientists of his time to take a serious look at the
UFO pH phenomenon now this case was also covered in depth in the book direct
encounters by Judith and Allan gansburg and it was one afternoon in
1955 Lydia then age n had her first encounter she was out walking near her
home in Jacksonville with her two siblings when they all saw a flash of light this was immediately followed by
the appearance of a very strange man and when they first saw this light and his figure walking towards them they being
somewhat religious thought it was the Lord coming to visit them but then they saw this man who was wearing a jumpsuit
and what looked like a black cape but he had a very pale face very unusual
looking they kind of reversed their opinion and became quite frightened and fled the area they ran straight home and
it was the next few days and weeks that Lydia started having weird nightmares
and it was years later and after several other encounters that she ended up going under hypnosis with Dr James Harter she
was of course taken back to this childhood incident and she recalled that this man approached her kind of grabbed
her by the shoulder next thing she knows she's being taken on board this craft
where she did see other children she didn't say whether or not these were her siblings but she found herself in a
strange kind of semicircular room she saw weird panels that were
different colors she was seated in a chair that was sort of part of the room itself she said a device of some kind
was placed over her head she felt like the ETS were sort of pulling thoughts
from her mind now she couldn't see much at this point but once this helmet or this
device was removed she saw a short bald human-looking man standing in front of
her he addressed her by her name Lydia and told her that she had been chosen by
them and that they would return for more visits with her which they did and this
turned out to be the first of at least four onboard encounters the second occurred many
years later almost 20 and it was around 9900 p.m. one evening in August of
1974 Lydia was then 28 years old was driving in a rural area just north of
Jacksonville Florida on Highway 1 and she saw a strange shining object
alongside the road and pulled into a nearby parking lot to take a closer look
now she first thought it might be a crashing helicopter though as she pulled over she could see it clearly wasn't and
no sooner had she pulled over when another car pulled up next to hers she
saw a man inside who seemed vaguely familiar to her though she couldn't say who it was but they both got out of
their car and were looking at this object object as it got lower and lower and landed behind some nearby trees she
turned to this guy and asked him if he had seen the UFO and he said yes and then he said something really unusual he
says they keep the time she thought that was a weird thing to say but she had the
impression that this gentleman whoever he was knew that the UFO was going to be
there she took a closer look at this guy and she said he was a little bit shorter than average
Italian kind of Asian looking with dark skin and he persuaded her to get into
his car so they could try to get a closer look now she surprised herself by
accepting this invitation and got in the car but as soon as she did she started to feel a little strange she felt a
strange sort of suffocating feeling next thing she know knew there was a lapse in
time and suddenly it was midnight and the two of them were now driving on a different road towards
Jacksonville now the man denied any memory of seeing anything and Lydia
couldn't really talk about it or question him cuz she felt a little unwell she had nausea and a headache and
she was quite confused about the missing time so she just went home and shortly
after this she began having dreams and kind of nightmares she said of lying on a table in a strange room and being
examined by by weird creatures humanoids who clearly were not
human so again years later she did go under hypnosis and explored this incident like she did her childhood
incident and she did recall being taken on board this craft she recall being put
on an examination table she said she saw three different types of beings one was
tall a bald head kind of largest ears but Bright Eyes a very small nose and
mouth grayish skin the other she couldn't really describe but said it
looked almost robotic but the third she said was totally human very much human
looking handsome with tan skin and they told her that she had been chosen
because of her chemistry and she said that while they were kind and reassuring there was
points of this examination that were unpleasant and even a little painful that's all she really recalled
she said she was ill for several days afterwards but she feels ultimately it
was a benevolent encounter because she noticed something else she suddenly started experiencing all kinds of
psychic events she now of course wonders if the
Italian Asian looking man she saw was one of the ETS and that he was
responsible for getting her into the UFO she would later see him again in Jacksonville but was not able to track
him down get any other information about him and meanwhile her contacts continued
her third major event occurred on August 26 1975 just one year later Lydia was now
employed as a businesswoman she was driving between Jacksonville and Callahan with a male companion when they
saw this bright flashing light over some nearby trees and like before she felt a weird
physical sensation some difficulty breathing some coldness her body began to shake next thing she
knew she passed out she woke up sometime later she's not sure how much later but
she was still in the driver's seat but on a different Road she later estimated it was about 3 hours of missing time now
under hypnosis with Dr Harter and also Jean Brunson she did recall being taken
on board a craft she found herself laying next to another woman she said
the ETS placed a device over her head uh she passed out because there was
movement on this table but when she awoke the ETS told her that she was now
quote one of them that the woman who was had been laying next to her was a part
of her so the ETS seemed very pleased with the results of this
procedure and that seemed to be the purpose of it she was escorted from the craft and back into her car
her friend who was in the car prior to the incident was still there though he
was unconscious uh so he had no memory of any of this she lost touch with him
shortly later and has not been able to track him down so unfortunately while he
is in some respects a corroborating witness he she has not been able to find him she said following this experience
she did start having some headaches some really strong emotional swings and it
was all of this which caused her to First seek hypnosis and she says also
after this experience her psychic abilities increased even more and now she couldn't deny it I mean she said she
was experiencing telepathy reading other people's thoughts she also began to
practice handson healing she also began to do channeling with an entity a female
entity she called anron who she believes was the the lady who had been placed
next to her inside the UFO and that they had been connected somehow and Antron
started giving her messages about preparing earthlings for upcoming great
catastrophes and basically started telling her and others through her that at some point people would likely be
evacuated from Earth and taken to another planet in the event of an
existential crisis so this was followed shortly later by a fourth encounter on February
7 1976 and on this occasion Lydia says she
received a telepathic message from Antron to go to Little talbet Island
this is near Jacksonville and she was instructed to wait on the pier now she wasn't going to
go alone she brought a male friend and they went there in around 1 p.m. after
waiting for 10 minutes this white fog quickly enveloped the pier and she
watched her friend fell fall asleep and she herself lost Consciousness and they
both woke up a few hours later she said she did feel a slight pain in her side
they went back to the car they remained there until 3:00 a.m. hoping something else would happen then suddenly the car
began to shake as if by an invisible force this frightened them and certainly
prompted them to leave the area so later under hypnosis she recalled
that both she and her friend were taken on board now her friend was unconscious
from beginning to end so he couldn't validate this but she recalled being
placed in a chair she said there were screen type things around she was approached by a man who then took her
from the chair into what she called or he did a council room there was a
U-shaped table she saw different types of humanoids she was placed in the center of this U put a
strange black box next to her and per Lydia this box began to show images on
the screen all about herself and events in her life one of the humanoids told
her that things were quote going very well they told her they needed to do one
more thing before returning her they took that box away brought in another
black box and Lydia was amazed to see sort of x-rays or holographs of her body
on the screen and she says at this point the ETS implanted a little Buckshot
shaped object an implant into her side she said there was no pain they told her
it was an implant and that its purpose was to quote improve connectivity and power they told her it would be
activated in 3 or 4 weeks and that was apparently the purpose of this encounter
because they then returned her to her car now needless to say these experiences
completely changed Lydia's life as Lydia says in her own words when they told me
I had been aboard of spacecraft I was shocked I didn't believe it took me a
year to get it all out and I still have flashbacks I get tired of being made fun
of but God and the aliens keep coming on sometimes it's just too weird for me
it's really humiliating being made fun of by the public and I really feel for her because she
was one of very few people at that time who was stepping forward to say say that she had been on board a
UFO now her case again was thoroughly researched by Dr Harter and as she says
I am one of the five most documented UFO Abduction cases in the United States
which certainly may have been true at that time and James Harter absolutely endorsed her case saying that her story
is quote true Beyond A Reasonable Doubt I don't think she is faking and in fact
she took and passed lie detector tests now Coral Lorenzen when contacted about
Lydia staler expressed some dismay that Lydia was charging people $30 to attend
a healing seminar and that Lydia was profiting in other ways such as selling T-shirts and contact buttons but she
does say that she does believe is a true contacte she says it appears
that she did have an experience but we were disappointed to find out that she was capitalizing on the
experience now many people do report healing abilities following their encounters uh Lydia is certainly one of
them she's done a lot of Hands-On healing she's got some testimonials as
well attesting to her abilities one lady Mary Elizabeth Murphy aged 69 had
suffered a car accident which caused some damage to her body that wasn't
healing well she attended a healing session and said that Lydia was able to straighten her crooked back and cure her
arthritis not only that cured her glaucoma I mean she spoke to reporters
and said quote I paid my $30 and it was the best money I ever spent in the world
if you come down here I'll Waltz for you and she's not the only one there was
another testimonial published in the very respected Omni magazine concerning
a cameraman who is suffering from cancer who had a session with Lydia and says he
was given a clean bill of health now Lydia does believe that her contacts are
absolutely friendly and she actually refers to them as quote Angels she is somewhat
religious but she says her psychic abilities include ESP prophecies the the
ability to see into a person's body sort of a medical intuitive also mental telepathy and
healing people of physical illness she says that electric appliances sometimes go Haywire around
her that's certainly something many contactees report so this yeah changed her life in
fact at one point she and Jean Branson founded quote the Jacksonville UFO Club
so this has taken over Lydia's life or certainly did at that time and as she
says sometimes when I see the way people are suffering it makes me want to cry
but if I get too involved I'm no good when I pray for them at first I didn't feel as if I was good enough to receive
these Powers I was divorced I hadn't been going to church I don't know how
God chose me to bestow this on because I don't think I was worthy of it
but she does feel the ETS will return and says they'll be back I know they
will now at some point after the late 1980s Lydia pretty much disappeared from
the UFO scene but before she did contactees Lynn and Anthony vulp who you
can see here said they visited Lydia in her home and had a really interesting
talk with her and some point they went for a drive with her and they all had an
amazing UFO encounter they were actually playing music to call down a UFO and it
showed up and it actually was broadcasting the same music back to them
but much louder so a really interesting and interactive encounter I think you'll
agree Lydia's case is pretty darn interesting for a lot of reasons one
that she's had so many encounters many which have been witnessed by outside
observers also the the fact that her case has been professionally investigated but to me I think the most
fascinating thing is that she became so powerfully psychic psychically awakened
at least partly as a result of her encounters she certainly thinks so but
the fact that she's doing healings this is something we do see quite often and
that she has testimonials I think speaks to the veracity of her
experiences people who say you know she healed me so there you go this is always
an experience I think almost without exception that affects a person very
profoundly and that's certainly true in Lydia's case I wonder where she is now I
couldn't locate her but that happens sometimes people just rise to the
Forefront and Fade Away into the background but there's always another case appearing and here is another one
which I'm pretty sure you haven't heard about I call this one the onboard experience of Joe Carol and Luke this
involves a young family a newly married couple with a
infant child who were driving through Goodland Kansas when they experienced a
missing time encounter that really affected them as you can imagine profoundly it occurred on June 20
1976 and while they initially had no real memory of what happened they did
start having some dreams about what occurred during this missing time some
physical effects as well and this is what prompted them to investigate
further and this is when they discovered that yep they were taken on board again a very well researched and authenticated
case which you'll I think you'll find of great interest this case was investigated by researcher Richard
sigismond a really good researcher very objective very scientific in his thinking and it was published in the
international UFO reporter which is published by the center for UFO studies
cuos this is a fascinating case it involves a young couple Joe a
19-year-old factory worker his wife Carol age 18 and their 4-month-old son
Luke and they were taking a drive from oh Ohio to Colorado on June 20
1976 it was around 1 a.m. they had just left Colby Kansas and were heading
westbound on Interstate 70 their son Luke was asleep in the back seat and
suddenly they heard a strange hissing sound kind of like a snake coming from the back seat this confused them so
Carol grabbed a flashlight started looking around and they realized this sound was actually coming from the the
speaker of their eight track tape machine which they used for playing rock
music they were really into music but at the same time they suddenly noticed three orange blue kind of star-like
lights in the sky and as they watched him they were amazed to see these objects kind of converge split apart and
then one went South one went North and the third Rose upwards and kind of hovered there in place and Joe
immediately turned to his wife Carolyn said no one can tell me there's no such
thing as UFOs Perell agreed and pointed out these objects looked very much like the ones
she and her mother had seen some time ago in Warren
Ohio so they were watching this and continuing down the highway when suddenly they noticed now four starlake
objects moving overhead two higher up and two kind of below them these were
white and considerably larger than the ones they had seen moments earlier and as
they were watching them Joe said how great would it be to go up in one of the
UFOs and Carol agreed yeah that would be great if quote the baby wasn't in the
car so she was concerned about their son Luke now their car was not in great
shape and Joe kind of jokingly said if they can make flying saucers like that I
can imagine what what they could do to my car if they'd pick us up and use us
if we could be guinea pigs for them maybe they'll fix our car cuz it's broke Carol kind of laughed and told him he
was quote a little nuts so the objects Dart off and further
down the road as they were beginning to approach Goodland Kansas they saw yet
another UFO this looked a little different it was closer this had the appearance of sort of a yellow cylinder
or rod with two glowing Spears on either end and without warning this object shot
straight up then swooped down and zoomed right over the top of their car so this
really impressed them Joe immediately pulled over they realized that they were at Mile Marker
37 as you can see right here and they watched this object move upwards becoming a tiny dot in the
sky and the next thing they know they're in a different location they didn't
quite realize it at the time they were now at Mile Marker 32 uh and some hours had passed uh but
this point they were still distracted by watching this UFO which had changed position and was Now sort of a distant
light in the woods alongside the road Carol turned to Joe and said I'll bet
that one landed and Joe said no you're seeing things Carol said you know never
know so Joe continued talking about how great it would be to go with the UFO occupants and quote see their engine
room they hadn't quite realized they had missing time and were in a different location but they realized it soon
enough because they continued driving and suddenly pulled into a gas station to refill the tank and buy some
cigarettes now leaving the station they were amazed to see a quote twinkling star sort of a star-like object that was
pacing their car they pulled over at a rest stop to watch it and it remained there hovering for a short time and they
were shocked at this point when suddenly the Eastern Sky began to brighten and
they realized Dawn was arriving and it was then that they realized that they had missing time and they really began
to wonder what happened because there were at least 3 hours that they could not account for so they checked their
bodies and were shocked to see some weird marks Carol noticed that her arms had a rash she hadn't noticed before she
noticed a few bruises and scratches what looked like needle marks there was a little horseshoe shaped Mark around her
right wrist a small abrasion next to her belly button Joe checked his body
noticed a needle Mark by his belly button a few squarish marks on his body what looked like a small puncture at the
crease of his elbow he says his knees were red they even noticed some marks on
their child's body Luke so little red marks on his chest a few little square
marks on his stomach so this upset them that they felt you know a little
concerned about this they drove onwards to Denver and as they were doing so
something else strange happened it uh they said this weird deep voice came
from Joe he doesn't think it was he saying this but they heard this voice
that said quote this is my world so this shocked Joe I mean he literally took his
hands off the steering wheel he began crying waving his hands over his head it was weird because the car remained on
course still going at 60 M an hour they arrived home they shared their story
with Joe's father he's very religious he called the minister the minister and the
father after hearing their experience told them that this experience occurred to them because they smoked cigarettes
and listened to rock music and that what they had experienced was the work of the devil so this just caused the young
couple to become even more frightened but they did quit smoking they stopped
listening to rock music even to the point that they destroyed their music tapes following this Carol had trouble
sleeping could only sleep with the lights on she started having nightmares they said these marks on their bodies
healed extraordinarily quickly they contacted the Air Force and the police
about their experience before finally being referred to the center of UFO studies and Richard sigismond but
meanwhile other strange events were occurring for example Carol was taking a
shower when she saw a glowing Apparition of a strange humanoid the kind that was
in her nightmares she screamed and it immediately disappeared but she says she
did receive a telepathic message that the beings that they had encountered were
good so this prompt them to go under hypnotic regression and they separately
underwent several sessions for a total of about 25
hours so this was thoroughly investigated and both independently
recalled being taken on board the craft and what's so interesting about this is their memories under hypnosis
corroborate each other under hypnosis they recalled that they had pulled over
at Mile Marker 37 to watch these UFOs it was Carol who recalled that they
actually drove off the road itself into a field towards some trees they reached
a small clearing surrounded by trees next to a creek where there was a huge
ship parked on the ground she said it was shaped like quote two huge pie
plates these were placed into end had rounded edges and looked like two
rotating rings around the perimeter they were rotating clockwise this was a big
craft about 150 feet wide maybe 40 feet high so they unhooked their seat belts
and found themselves walking right up to it the door opened and they were escorted inside into a very brightly lit
room now this is what Carol recalled she recalled seeing quote computer things
and what looked like bright flashing lights to her right she saw a window
above all these flashing lights she could see trees she said there was a
chair below the window which was melded into the floor of the craft itself she
said that the center of the room had a brown pillar that went from floor to
ceiling this is something many contactees report she said there was also a Strang looking sort of steel box
on the far side of the room she said she saw it looked like a clipboard or something hanging from a hook now at
this point she's not seeing any beings but suddenly she realized her husband Joe was gone he was not there and she
got a telepathic message to go down a hallway to another room which she did
and inside that room she saw a table with a bright light above it a voice told her telepathically to lay down on
the table which she did she down on her back and then on her stomach she felt
some numbness in her arms at one point a tightness around her wrist she also felt
a pressure on her back coming from what she felt was a long tube of some kind
she was then told to go to another room which she did now this is when she started to feel a little fear and
concern she expressed that she wanted to go home she wanted to see her child and
this was when she saw a humanoid for the first time which you can see her drawing
here and this humanoid came in and along with him was her son she said this
humanoid was wearing this suit a helmet he said it was about 5T 5 in and she
quickly grabbed her son and hugged him carried him over to the window and she looked out she was shocked to see quote
Stars shooting by she could see the Earth receding into the distance moments later it became pitch
black outside she said the room heated up slightly and looking outside she now
saw that they had come in for a landing next to some trees she received a telepathic
instruction to returned to the original room that they had walked into at this
point they took Luke from her they assured her you know not to worry that they were good no harm would come to her
the whole experience was not terribly frightening to her she felt they were absolutely benevolent two of the beings
held Luke kind of bouncing him and playing with with him while Carol was instructed again to lay down on a table
she says she was given what she believed was a shot or something in her arm with a sort of boxy tube shaped device then
one of the ETS picked her up she kind of passed out at this point carried her to
the car which was now on the side of the road at Mile Marker
32 now that's Carol's memory Joe has no memory of driving into the field
he did remember seeing the UFOs but his first memory under hypnosis is being
alone in a room and laying down as he felt something pressed against the crease of the elbow of his left arm
where he had seen this Mark oh he said this did cause some pain he felt warm a
little laded he also felt something like socks on his feet he's really not
sure he said he had a little bit of difficulty breathing and was experiencing some chest pain but then he
started looking around the room and he says he saw a counter that melded seamlessly into the wall what looked
like plastic tubes or canisters drawers perhaps on this counter you saw what
looked like a rubber hose hanging from the wall he saw a big Silver Box sort of
in front of the counter against the wall again melded into the ship itself he also saw a doorway he saw a shelf above
him with strange alien in instruments what looked like a silver rod with five
sort of red strings Fanning out from it uh so after looking at this he says
he received a telepathic message to get up from the table and get dressed and it
was then that he saw two humanoids who came in and he says they handed him this
6inch long white board thing and a rod which he held briefly on his lap but
then he was told to stand up they took it from him two humanoids held him by his arms walked him down a corridor he
says this was a large craft he passed about five doorways leading into
separate rooms finally coming up to a doorway which led out of the craft he
looked out there and could see trees and as he stood there one of the beings arrived and was carrying his wife Carol
asleep in his arms so then one of the beings stood in front of Joe and something really God
happened he says he perceived what looked like a spiral of light kind of forming between him and this being and
Joe felt almost as if his mind was pulled from his body kind of like an outof Body Experience he says he felt
like he was merging with the mind of this being and he got a real strong
impression that the ETS quote didn't have any bad qualities they seemed so
peaceful so this was a very spirit spiritual experience for him next with
the assistance of the entities cuz he was feeling a little shaky he walked down the shiny steel looking steps and
into the car he watched as one of the entities carried Carol to the car placed her gently in the seat fastened her seat
belt locked the door and closed it and then he went into the seat and closed
his door and as he was preparing to drive off one of the beings stood there
and waved goodbye and Joe felt this intense wave of sadness he said it was like as if he was
leaving a loved one Carol was still asleep at this point but he watched the
lights on the ship suddenly spin faster these little rotating Rings until suddenly it Rose silently into the sky
and moved quickly upwards becoming a tiny dot in the sky at which point he
drove back onto the road and they continued their interrupted Journey so they called this under
hypnosis and it was quite a shock for them to find out that they had been taken on board and they both reported
feeling somewhat vulnerable and that the ETS could take them any time but Richard
Sigman counseled them and ultimately after going over everything that happened they felt it was a very
benevolent experience Carol says she is much more aware of the world she thinks
about things much more deeply Joe said his personality changed he had been very
introverted but he became much more open makes friends more easily and he said
that that obbe like experience he had on board the ship made him less afraid of
dying they both consider the experience as quote an honor and a privilege and
both felt that the humanoids were friendly and showed consideration for their needs and for their
well-being now FYI as I mentioned the researcher did speak with the father and the minister who confirmed that Joe and
Carol did tell them this story and showed them these marks on their body so again a very well verified case there
you go I mean that's the kind of case that's undeniable given that the researcher interviewed both Witnesses
they were hypnotized separately and their stories still corroborate to an unbelievable degree and the researcher
had the foresight to contact the witness's parent the father and the minister who AB absolutely confirmed
what the witnesses had experienced so there's a lot of confirmation we know
exactly where this case took place I also found it interesting because both
Witnesses felt that this was ultimately a very benevolent encounter although initially they were quite
traumatized so this is a pattern I certainly see quite a bit it can be a
really startling experience and somewhat scary and Trauma azing But ultimately
once a person steps back and takes a closer look at what actually happened to them they realize you know they weren't
there to hurt us nothing like that so there's a lot of really interesting patterns to this case that I think are
really important and it's one of the reasons I wanted to present it that because of the descriptions of the ETS I
find super interesting the description of the interior of the craft the things they were told a lot of in details in
these onboard experiences again they have a lot more information than your typical sighting or even a face-to-face
encounter with humanoids and now we move to another
case this one is also so interesting I call this one the onboard Encounter of
Miriam and Sonia this took place in the summer of 1979 or 1980 they're not
entirely certain but it took place in Bayamon Puerto Rico and again a
professionally researched case uh multiple witness case some really
interesting physiological effects that were really benevolent some incredible
spiritual aspects as well to this case and a ton I mean a lot of information
imparted to the witnesses far more than I can present in this little episode
this this extraordinarily complex case comes from researcher Jorge Martin and
was published both in the Flying Saucer review and in the Spanish language
publication evidencia a and this involves two witnesses known only by
pseudonyms Miriam and her mother Sonia now Miriam's father prior to their
experience this is Sonia's husband he had passed away shortly before this encounter and the mother went into this
Tail Spin of grief to the point that her health was failing badly I mean she was
weighed only 85 lbs and looked like she was going to pass away so in order to
treat her cuz doctors were not having any luck Miriam and Sonia decided to
drive from San Juan Puerto Rico to the Florida region this is still in Puerto Rico where their Uncle lived so that he
could help care for them they were driving their 1974 for Chevrolet Monte Carlo along Puerto Rico Highway number
two it was on 700 p.m. on the evening in question they had just reached the West
bamon Commercial Center at at hat Tas
when suddenly everything went dark they couldn't see the road around them the trees the street lights they both heard
a loud humming noise both Miriam and Sonia became confused they felt like
both of them had become entranced one turned to the other and looked at them and both felt like they were
hypnotized now Miriam suddenly felt almost as if the car itself was not on the road and the next thing they knew
the car filled with this blue white light and suddenly with almost no transition they saw that it was now 9:30
2 and 1/2 hours later and they were in a completely different location they were
now at aasbo this is 73 km about 43 Mi
ahead on the road and they had no memory of how they got there now the only
effect from this encounter initially was that Sonia began to recover from her
illness and depression and for many years following this the missing time encounter remained
a mystery but 15 years later they did go under hypnosis separately to invoid
avoid contaminating each other's account and they recalled what happened and just as an as side I will
say Miriam herself was suffering from bone pain in her legs and joint pain
that the doctors were never able to diagnose but that also disappeared so they knew something had happened and
under hypnosis Miriam she recalled that they were driving through baman again
everything became dark light enveloped the car and she did not remember this consciously but under nosis she was
shocked to watch her mother suddenly disappear from the front passenger seat
at the same exact time she saw a large metallic silver gray Flying Saucer at
very low level right in front of their car then she herself was struck by a beam of light and found herself
incredibly moving through the roof of the car itself looking down she saw the
car below her and below that the road it's self was receding the car was
floating she was floating and they were going upward uh and above her she looked
up she could see the same craft and very quickly a door opened and she saw this
six foot tall kind of white figure standing in the doorway she said he had
a large head dark eyes a small mouth and nose and he had this little smile just
sort of a slightly bent smile very friendly in fact as she said
he is very dainty and delicate so we would probably call this a gray and this
gray as he appeared to be pull her inside of the craft and said come with me don't be afraid we aren't going to
harm you don't worry because up until that point she had been terrified but
now meeting this gray face to face she felt incredibly calm peaceful she felt
absolutely that this gray was truthful as she says I felt a great goodness
emanate from that being so this gray continued to reassure
her Miriam immediately asked about her mother and the gray said that her mother was also with them and was all right not
to worry now per Miriam the inside of this craft was a beautiful shade of sort
of pearly silver she saw several other short about 3ot gray suddenly appear and
she was led down a curved hallway into a rounded room she said there was a seat
and other features in this room all of which were a seamless part of the room itself no joints no rivets nothing like
that and she saw what looked like a quote stainless steel bed and a table
filled with strange instruments of many kind said the room was filled with these small little gray guys and as Miriam
says in the chamber there are more of the little beings very graceful they
emanate a great sensation of love and peace they talk to me mentally they tell
me they are going to help me she was lifted up gently onto the table and they
began to examine her touching her body with these fine long metallic rods and
they told her what was happening they explained to her that they were giving her an energy reinforcement to improve
her health and again since she was a little girl Miriam suffered from undiagnosed pain pain in Her Bones and
the joints of her legs and the Grays basically told her that she was ill and they were curing her they began to use
many different types of instruments to sort of pulse energy through her body it
didn't hurt she said it was actually pretty comfortable and at one point the Grace said and I quote you have what
your people call cancer of the bone but don't be afraid we are curing you
because you have got to be well for some very important work work that you are going to have to do in the future and
you need to be in complete good health to do that work and they elaborated in
detail they explained that she would be meeting an important person in the future that together they would help
inform Humanity about the reality of ETS and the great changes that our world is
facing in the future Miriam asked again about her mother Sonia and they told her
that her mother Sonia was also very H and was receiving treatment they explained all kinds of
things they told her Humanity was suffering because of excessive materialism they told her that Humanity
had gone through several Advanced civilizations that had risen and fallen
and that each time humanity had not Advanced spiritually to the degree that
they needed to to survive and they said that Earth is now facing irreversible
disasters because of this and that it was their mission to help they imparted a lot of information which
you can read about in Jorge's article but they then took her to another room
she says a tall being placed a strange instrument against her forehead which
reminded her of a compass Miriam felt waves of love and goodness she
absolutely thought this was the most amazing and wonderful being as she says
it was something subl it is not as we have been told that these beings are bad it is not so this
particular being was Sublime you could see it feel it he was very wise I never
felt here on Earth the love and goodness that emanated from
himself so this is something I do hear a lot people feel this unbelievable pure
love coming from these beings now this being told her that there were many beings visiting our
planet they told her that our governments had secured ET technology
and were abusing it and that this was a real problem Miriam was then introduced
to a beautiful but absolutely human looking ET the tall gray told her that
they were working together to assist in the evolution of humanity particularly the spiritual Evolution and told her
that some of these human-looking ETS do Walk Among Us she was then taken to
another room where she saw more short Grays looking out the window she got a real shock they actually led her out of
the craft at some point but she saw mountains a small village none of it was
recognizable to her the easts told her that they had actually landed on a high
spot in the Swiss elps this is quite some distance from Puerto Rico and they
again explained that our own governments were working against them were attempting to manipulate and control
control humanity and their spiritual progress they were doing everything they could to counteract that
told her all kinds of stuff all kinds of information was imparted and then Miriam was reunited
with her mother Sonia the craft took off and landed on what appeared to Miriam to be a beach uh
they were taken out through a doorway and something very incredible
happened both were shocked to see Miriam's father Sonia's husband who had
died again 9 months earlier in September of 1978 there was as you can imagine a
tearful reunion this was a very deeply spiritual experience uh so and uh yeah this was
her father's spirit and he looked different he wasn't able to walk he had
received injuries during his time in the military but now he was in full Health
he looked young and healthy the next thing Miriam knew she was being put back
in their car together they found themselves suddenly in aroso with no
knowledge of the amazing events that had just transpired so that's Miriam's recall
Sonia again separately went under hypnotic regression she recalled some very
interesting things like Miriam she recalled this dark Ness enveloping the car followed by
a blue light the next thing she knew she was outside of the car she looked down
saw the car floating above the ground below her and her daughter Miriam was
still in the driver's seat she looked up saw this saucer above her she was
quickly pulled inside of it greeted by five little gray guys who took her into a white round room filled with medical
equipment it reminded her very much of a hospital room it was absolutely Ely
spotless she was telepathically instructed to lie down on a table and
she became a little frightened but the beings told her to calm down and moments later two other human looking ETS
arrived and she said they were looked amazing they had clear green eyes
silvery blonde hair and she said quote they look Angelic they look like perfect
men in fact their appearance kind of reminded her of Jesus they told her all kinds of things that
they had originally lived on Mars they said that they wore tunics she said they
looked identical like twins they spoke to her telepathically and told her that they
were doing an operation of some kind on her they plac all manners of weird
strange instruments which she had trouble describing but she did draw them as you can see she says she felt no pain
in fact she felt a warm comfortable Heat but at one point she felt like they were opening up her brain this did concern
her a little bit the beings explained that she had to purge herself of the
negative emotions and worries that these were the main cause of her ill health
and as Sonia says in her own words I feel a great sensation of well-being
they want to impart positivism to me happiness that my entire being is being
renewed the tall human with the dark brown hair tells me that I am very sick but that
they are curing me they explain this in great detail they told her that her
daughter miam had a very important crucial mission that it was actually
sona's duty to help assist her daughter with this Mission they told her that
Humanity was saturated with evil and disease and it was crucial that Humanity
started to progress spiritually if it was to survive they explained that they work with many people to help facilitate
Humanity's progress now Sonia says at one point she
was introduced to an apparent enlightened Master the short little asian-looking man with a little goatee
he showed her what she perceived to be sort of a paper with strange writing on it and he began to impart prophecies
basically telling her that there would be great disasters in the future of our
planet next she remembered looking out the window and seeing the Swiss alpes
just exactly as her daughter Miriam had behind her she saw a small gray she
described him she says quote he was a small being with a large head big dark
eyes no eyelids or eyebrows a tiny mouth two holes for a nose a thin frail body
long slender arms no ears merely something there at the side of his head
she did also notice that the being had only four fingers now the next thing she knows
remembers she's being reunited with her daughter Miriam and like Miriam she recalls being
led out to this area which she did not perceive as a beach but more as a spiritual realm of some kind which
apparently it was because she was absolutely amazed and delighted to see
her deceased husband and not only her husband but her mother and father and
other people her loved ones who had passed on and she said they were actually floating towards her in this
spiritual realm of some kind and she had this really wonderful reunion with them
the next thing she knew she was back in the craft she was shown books that she
believed contained the laws of life and the next thing both she and her daughter
were taken from the craft she says she watched the car actually get placed back
on the road Miriam didn't recall this part but she watched the car go back on the road and the ETS placed them both
back inside of it and the craft departed and that's when they found themselves back in
aasbo what a dramatic case that is and I think has a lot to teach us so
interesting with both these Witnesses describing the same thing both Witnesses is experiencing a really dramatic
healing uh where the doctors themselves here on Earth could not heal them the
messages they got the reasons for the contact all the different types of ETS
they saw that's not that unusual for people to see different types of
humanoids on board a craft so they saw Grays and what appear to be perfectly
human looking people as well and other types so yeah lots to take away from that case
again it is at least partially Anonymous a lot of witnesses who have these really
extensive encounters are quite reluctant to step forward but thanks to Jorge
Martin for bringing this case forward you can certainly read about it I showed
you the references there in this episode if you want to learn more about it CU
yeah there's far more information than I was able to talk about
here all right and now we move to our last and final case in this episode
another Super interesting and somewhat briefer case but I think an important one nevertheless I call this one the
onboard Encounter of Fernando again this is a firstname only
witness who elected to remain at least partially Anonymous but certainly a
fascinating case of a gentleman who saw a UFO and next thing he knows he's
having missing time was taken on board I mean there's it's a really interesting
case because I think this is the last thing this witness was expecting this last and final case comes
from Spanish researcher and author Manuel carbal and he writes that this
case is quote a very typical one but it contains a number of very variations that give it the appearance of being
absolutely authentic so this took place in Autumn of 1986 in the little town of
KERO Spain which you can see here and it was a Friday evening as Fernando who was
a young man employed as an electrician left his place of employment for the day
and he went to go get his motorcycle which had just been overhauled and tuned up in preparation for a CrossCountry
event that he was going to participate in so he drove his motorcycle to a
nearby Quarry where there were many little Hills which were good for testing the power of His Bike and it worked
beautifully he drove around for about an hour and I'll just let Fernando describe
what happened next as he says it must have been about 700 p.m. I sat down for
a while on a big Stone to have a smoke then above the other end of the Quarry
high up in the sky among the clouds I saw a great light slowly this light
approached me then suddenly seven orange colored triangles came out of it flying
in a pyramidal formation there in line in front four
behind one of the triangles broke formation and came straight towards me
so this alarmed him and seeing this craft making a beline for him Fernando
jumped up got on his motorcycle which again had worked fine previously he
tried to drive off but the engine wouldn't start he tried over and over again to start it but it just wouldn't
work so this was freaking him out needless to say and as Fernando says in
his own words meanwhile that thing was approaching I just stood there quietly
there was nothing I could do I couldn't get help anywhere and I couldn't escape as the thing came nearer I could make
out more details of it it was an equilateral triangle with each side about 12 M long it its orange color was
tremendously Vivid its Corners were blunted and in one of them it had a
glass panel seeming the window of its cabin so Fernando was absolutely a
struck as this craft came up right close to him lowered itself to about 6 ft
above the ground and stayed there hovering and as for says I was just
standing there in absolute astonishment then from the belly of it there came a
beam of light and two beings came down out of it along this beam I myself was
laughing at it and I said to myself it's not possible it's a dream then one of
the beings grabbed hold of me and they took me into the craft with them now per
Fernando the beings were about 4 feet tall you can see his drawing here here
and he's as he says they were quote green colored with very big heads and
very bright eyes they didn't speak but seemed to communicate
telepathically now the researcher believes that what he was seeing was actually their jumpsuits or perhaps the
light from the craft at any rate Fernando does recall without hypnosis
being taken on board and again they were speaking to him telepathically as
Fernando says I do remember that I understood them it was just as though
they were reading my thoughts and I was reading theirs I arrived inside the craft and they stretched me out on a
platform I was gazing up at a very powerful white light and I fell asleep
and I remember nothing more when I woke up again I was lying beside my motorcycle I looked up at the sky
searching for the craft but it was no longer there so that's all he recalls
consciously he never did seek hypnosis but Fernando rushed home and learned that his family
was very worried about him cuz it was now 11:00 p.m. he was missing about 3 to
4 hours of time so it's likely there is more to this than he consciously
recalls however here's an important detail Fernando remembered that years
earlier as a young child he had seen a UFO one night over the beach and ever
since then he has always believed in them and and he did in fact read a little bit about them but he never
expected to see them again much less be taken on board following this experience
he did examine his body and found what appeared to be a small puncture mark on his right arm and seeing this he became
even more convinced that he had been taken on board and examined and as
Fernando says in his own words I'm absolutely sure they put me to sleep in
that craft and did some sort of analysis on me I was their guinea pig I have described what happened to me so that my
case may serve as an example and so that nobody will take me to be unbalanced
what happened to me is as absolutely certain as the fact that I am alive and
I exist there you go yet another example of a person who's had an onboard
experience and these five cases are of course just the tip of the iceberg there are many researchers who believe these
cases number well beyond the thousands or tens of thousands or more even into
the millions but the fact is some people don't remember most are very reluctant
to talk about it thankfully times are changing but I think if you just take
these five cases alone you get a pretty accurate representation of what it's like to be taken on board a UFO meet ETS
face Toof face and have this really extensive encounter and yeah each of them have
something to offer I really like the Goodland Kansas case because they're driving along and they see this UFO and
they start talking well wouldn't it be neat to go on board and guess what happened so in a way you could look at
that one as a close encounter of the fifth kind hard to say for sure but yeah
all of these cases definitely have all kinds of things to teach us not only
about ourselves and how we react but about the ETS and their technology and
again their agenda so many different types of ETS so many cases taking place
all over the planet cases taking place for a very long time so many multiple
witness cases so much evidence to support them sorry but Skeptics just
don't have a leg to stand on if you want to knock down a case there's always
another one to take its place because again this is a lot more common than
people realize so that that's it for this week I really appreciate all of you watching
it's because of you I do this research and I'm putting out these episodes so much love to you thank you thank you
thank you and until next time keep asking those hard questions keep
searching for the truth it's up to you to do it our governments are not going to and most important of all keep having
fun cuz that's why we're here bye for now talk to you next week sh
