"TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER"
Nov 11, 2022

Summary:
Nov 11, 2022
When it comes to UFOs, one of the most common assumptions is that ETs would land on the White House lawn and say, “Take me to your leader!” Ignoring the fact that UFOs have hovered over the White House at least twice, the truth is they have shown themselves to a wide variety of world leaders. Most people are probably unaware that presidents have seen UFOs, as have senators, representatives, governors and many other leaders across the United States and the world.

This video presents more than twenty world leaders who have had close encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials, reaching back to 1947, the Modern Age of UFOs all the way to the present day.

The United States has produced more than a dozen such cases.

Aug 1, 1947: Mayor Potter P. Howard of Boise, Idaho is on a United Airlines flight when he sees a flight of a dozen discs sweep below the jet.

Aug 5, 1952: Mayor H.A. Latham of Gainesville, Texas and two family members observe a massive cylindrical-shaped UFO darting overhead.

Sep 6, 1952: Congresswoman Isabella King of Arizona and her friend observe a whirling tear-shaped object while driving near Tucson.

Oct 4, 1955: Senator Richard Russell of Georgia and others observe two metallic discs while on a train-ride through Russia.

Nov 25, 1955: Colorado State Senator, Sam T. Taylor observes a glowing dirigible-shaped object perform incredible maneuvers.

Aug 10, 1963: Mayor Harrly L. Bishop of Mt. Vernon, Illinois watches a bright red UFO move down the street, then stop and hover over his home.

Apr 25, 1966: Governor Haydon Burns of Florida is flying over Orlando when everyone onboard the plane sees two glowing objects follow them.

Jan 6, 1969: Jimmy Carter, soon-to-be Governor and then President reports his sighting of a multi-colored object hovering at low elevation.

Sep 6, 1971: Congressman Malcolm Wallop (soon to be Senator) of Wyoming observes a fleet of a dozen objects leapfrogging in the sky.

Oct 1973: Governor John Gilligan of Ohio and his wife observe an amber-colored object which sends down a bright beam of light.

1974: Governor Ronald Reagan of California is flying over Bakersfield when he and the flight crew chase a UFO for several minutes.

Mar 5, 1977: an unnamed Senator of North Dakota (and his wife) are chased in their car by two low-flying UFOs.

1982: Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio sees a UFO while staying at the home of actress Shirley Maclaine in Graham, Washington.

Mar 13, 1997: Governor Fife Symington of Arizona is one of thousands of people who witness the massive Phoenix Lights display.

UFOs are a global phenomenon. So, it should come as no surprise that leaders all across the world are also seeing UFOs. What follows are a dozen more examples of extraordinary UFO encounters from world leaders across our planet.

Jul 9, 1952: Mayor Oscar Linke of Gleimershausen, Germany (and his daughter) come upon a landed UFO and occupants in the forest.

Sep 9, 1954: Mayor Raoul Laurent of Saint-Dizier, France is amazed to see a cigar-shaped craft move directly over City Hall.

1950s: Fidel Castro, soon to become the President of Cuba reports his sighting of an enormous round glowing object illuminating a wide area.

1956: President Hassan Rouhani of Iran (then only seven years old) is outside a mosque when a UFO lands directly in the mosque yard.

1973: President Idi Amin of Uganda (and many others) observe a UFO hover for seven minutes, then descend onto the surface of Lake Victoria.

1974: President Luis Echeverria of Mexico observes a gigantic UFO over the town of Cuernavaca. Other witnesses include Mayor Valentin Lopez Gonzalez of Cuernavaca and Governor Emilio Riva Palacio of Morelos.

Mar 1974, Mayor Petit of Rimogne, France sees a shiny, orange, oval disc hover overhead for ten minutes, then move off.

1975: Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy of Grenada sees a UFO, and is also involved in an apparent UFO/crash retrieval of a tall six-fingered ET.

1979: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil (and Brazilian Amabassador Celso Furtado) see a glowing object hover over the sea.

Sep 18, 1997, President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of the Republic of Kalmykia is taken onboard an ET craft to another planet and then returned.

These accounts from world leaders across the U.S. and the world are likely just a small sample of the actual number of cases. Most leaders who have encounters like these are likely keeping them secret. The time for truth and transparency on this subject is now! UFOs are clearly intentionally showing themselves to world leaders. It's time that our leaders start telling the truth about UFOs.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
today's episode I call take me to your leader there's a cliche in the UFO field that if ETS 
were arrived on our planet they would land on the White House lawn and say take me to your leader 
and perhaps this is not really a cliche at all because UFOs did in fact hover over the White 
House in the early 1950s a couple of times they were photographed they were caught on radar we 
chased after them it did not get a particularly friendly reception and I'm sure you have heard 
of several encounters with world leaders such as the President Eisenhower alleged meeting in 
1954 at Edwards Air Force Base or perhaps the encounter with President Nixon showing Jackie 
Gleason E.T bodies at a Air Force Base in Florida so I'm not talking about these cases I have about 
20 or more cases in which highly placed world leaders across the United States and the world 
have actually gone public and said in their own words that they've had UFO encounters 
this includes presidents like Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan but also Governors senators 
Representatives people in all stages of politics all levels of political office and it's not just 
in the United States this is across the world so this is what I'd like to talk about today I think 
these cases are important for a number of reasons our world leaders are the ones who are responsible 
for setting policy enacting laws and basically doing the right thing for all Humanity and they 
are being contacted by UFOs and I'm guessing the vast majority of them are not talking about it 
these cases are important for that reason alone and as a researcher Antonio Unis writes and I 
quote UFO sightings by heads of state are always an important Milestone because it 
shows that this phenomenon reaches all walks of life including politicians and national leaders 
so what I'd like to do is take you on a little Journey Through Time and present all the cases 
that I could find of world leaders who have had UFO encounters and this reaches back decades all 
the way to really the dawn of the Modern Age of UFOs 1947 up to pretty much the present day 
I've got a lot of cases I'd like to present to you today so let's just get started among 
the first politician or world leader that I could find to step forward and talk about their own UFO 
encounter was Potter P Howard he was the mayor of Boise Idaho in 1947. and on August 1st 1947 
mayor Howard was on a United Airlines flight traveling from Boise to Reno Nevada and while 
over the vicinity of Winnemucca the mayor saw a fleet of a dozen discs sweep below the plane 
and as he told the Idaho Statesman newspaper and I quote the saucers were several thousand 
feet below the plane a woman passenger also saw the 12 discs so this was a very early case but 
ever since then year after year politicians and world leaders have been stepping forward 
to talk about their own encounters and in fact the next one I could find occurred 
five years later on August 5th 1952 and this involves the former mayor of Gainesville Texas 
his name is h a Latham and he shared his story of his UFO enconnor with the news telegram newspaper 
mayor Latham was fishing with his brother Jack and teenage son Jimmy on the evening of August 
5th when they all simultaneously noticed a cylindrical-shaped object flying overhead 
was comparable in size he said to a large airplane and moved slowly at first in an arc overhead then 
darted extremely rapidly to the West and as mayor Latham said I've been skeptical up to now of all 
these Flying Saucer stories but all three of us saw it at the same time another really excellent 
case occurred that same year about one month later on September 6 1952 it was 4 55 p.m when 
former congresswoman Isabella King who was in fact the first congresswoman in Arizona's history 
she and her friend Bill McLean observed an orange tear-shaped object overhead it first world on its 
vertical access and then descended very quickly stopped and began whirling in the opposite 
direction and retraced its path upward so clearly an unusual object not a shooting star or a plane 
or anything like that and after interviewing the witnesses and investigating the incident 
Intelligence Officers from the Air Force's Project Blue Book were stumped they could not explain it 
and the incident became case number 2048 in Blue Book files and was declared unidentified it was 
in fact one of several unexplained sightings over the City of Tucson at that time it's a good case 
it was three years later October 4 1955 around 7 pm when Senator Richard Russell of 
Georgia was a passenger on a train traveling through the transcoccusa region of Russia 
he had his whole crew with them and looking out the window of the train Senator Russell 
and the others saw a large disc shaped craft rising up from alongside the railroad tracks 
they said a bright flame was coming from the bottom of the craft which ascended and 
actually crossed the tracks in front of the train this was immediately followed by another craft 
so Senator Russell alerted his Camp companions who only saw the second disc 
before the Soviet train officials quickly shut the cursed curtains and refused to let the passengers 
look outside so they were trying to cover it up but one of the witnesses was Colonel Hathaway 
who said and I quote I doubt if you are going to believe this but we all saw it Senator Russell was 
the first to see this flying disc we've been told for years that there isn't such a thing but all 
of us saw it one disc ascended almost vertically at a relatively slow speed with its outer surface 
revolving slowly to the right to an altitude of about six thousand feet where its speed then 
increased sharply as it headed north the second flying disc was seen performing the same actions 
about one minute later and the take off area was about one to two miles south of the rail line 
so at the time Senator Russell was the head of the armed services committee it's a very powerful 
position within the U.S Senate and he reported his sighting to various intelligence agencies 
but when queried about the sighting by reporters from the Los Angeles Examiner 
Russell was very brief in his reply and said only I have discussed this matter with the affected 
agencies and they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this time 
so this remains secret for quite some time and it wasn't until 1985 that the 
files about the incident were Declassified and the details on this case were revealed 
but he's certainly not the only Senator to have had a close encounter there's a long list of Highly placed government officials who have seen UFOs 
and it wasn't long after Senator Russell's citing same year in fact that Colorado a state senator S 
T Taylor also saw a UFO this was on November 25 1955 and it was over La Veta Colorado 
this was a dirigible shaped object and according to the senator this object glowed blue green and 
had an almost jelly-like appearance he estimated it was moving about half the speed of a shooting 
star so very quick it appeared to be at about 15 000 feet elevation and it was diving downward 
overhead at a 45 degree angle but at one point it actually leveled off and then moved Upward at a 30 
degree angle and off over mount meestus so clearly not a shooting star Senator Taylor estimates it 
was in fuel for about five seconds it made no sound and had no exhaust he reported his case to 
the FBI and later to Project Blue Book who after investigating the case and interviewing Senator 
Taylor were not able to identify it and declared it unexplained this is blue book case number 3869
so a good case with an excellent Witness and another encounter that seems almost intentional occurred on August 10 1963 
and this was witnessed by Harry L Bishop he was the former mayor of Mount Vernon in Illinois 
and recently there had been a number of sightings in the area but on the night in question August 
10 1963 calls began to flood into the local police station and mayor Bishop was unaware 
of all the activity until his wife observed a strange object around 10 o'clock that night and 
called him outside and he ran outside to view it and was shocked at what he saw I'd just like 
to read a quote from mayor Bishop himself as he says I could hardly believe my eyes 
he said that a Bright fire Fireball was quote coming right down the Centralia Road from the 
north he said it was the brightest red light I've ever seen it appeared to be only 300 or 400 feet 
high was oval shaped and was about the size of a wash tub he said I first saw the lighted object 
following the root of Centralia Road when it got over my house it stopped and I could see 
it very clearly although it was bright red it did not light up the neighborhood it seemed to 
be making a light whirring sound so this is very interesting that this object should travel down 
the road and then stop right over the mayor's house makes me wonder if it did this on purpose 
um mayor Bishop immediately did what anyone should do when they see a UFO he got more witnesses he called his neighbors out to watch it too because he was worried as he 
says everyone would think I was crazy but his neighbors came out they saw it too as mayor 
Bishop says and I quote I called the neighbors and they also watched the strange lighted object 
I noticed a car coming down the Centralia Road it stopped suddenly and the driver 
jumped out and looked upwards he saw the object too and it startled him to a stop 
so mayor Bishop did talk to reporters from the register news who investigated it and 
found out that yes there were in fact a number of sightings going on at that time 
mayor bishop and his neighbors watched this object for a good 10 or 15 minutes as it 
moved Westward and finally blinked out as mayor Bishop says like somebody had turned the light off 
but after just a few seconds it reappeared to the west and moved away at a high rate of speed and he 
later learned that there were other Witnesses including Robert Trammell a former Army pilot 
so the sighting did cause a local sensation and was printed up in several local newspapers and it 
really makes me wonder if these UFOs and occupants are showing themselves to world leaders on purpose 
here's another case this occurred on April 25 1966 it was just before 
9 pm when Florida Governor Hayden Burns took off from a plane in Orlando Florida 
along with him were his wife the pilot the co-pilot and three campaign ads and four newsmen 
it was just a few minutes after takeoff they had reached an altitude of about 6 000 feet and 
without warning two bright glowing objects began to follow the plane they are observed by everyone 
on board including of course Senator Burns who looked out the window and said it's a UFO the 
co-pilot described the UFO as quote two brilliant Globes side by side it kept right with us 
and at first Senator Burns did keep quiet about it until he heard that there were a lot 
of other Witnesses and in an article for the News Tribune he described the sighting in his own words 
and as Senator Byrne says and I quote we saw the thing ahead of us right in the air Lane but about 
500 feet higher we watched it for six or seven minutes at first it looked like a real bright star 
as we grew closer it took on a much greater Dimension the light was most intense almost 
like looking into a direct light bulb we saw no image because the light was blinding 
so they called the Miami Airport who told them that the object did not appear on their radar 
but after tracking this object for several miles Governor Burns ordered the pilot to 
actually pursue the UFO it was it was at this moment that the object actually disappeared 
and as Senator Bern or Governor Burns says and I quote I think we scared it away because then 
it Rose at an accelerated rate something in the vicinity of 300 to 400 miles per hour the object 
ascended immediately from 8 000 to near 20 000 feet and at first it had been absolutely still
so um to his credit he did decide to go public he began his political career as mayor of 
Jacksonville Florida but became Florida governor in 1965. it was up for re-election in 1966 but 
unfortunately he lost the election many other cases though just a few years later September 
6 1971 Wyoming congressional representative Malcolm Wallop who was soon to be a senator 
had just finished eating dinner with a group of 15 guests at a ranch near Bighorn Wyoming they 
were all outside on the porch looking at the stars and without warning at about 10 15 p.m a 
small group of brilliantly lit objects Rose from the North West Horizon sped across the sky and 
disappeared to the Southwest these objects were in a tight formation and were pulsing in brightness 
and they appeared to move with this strange quote leap frogging maneuvers 
there was a lot of witnesses and they disagreed on disagreed on the exact number of objects 
with estimates ranging from about eight to as many as 20 objects 
but they did all agree that these objects were oval in shape and moving faster than jet aircraft 
in fact some of them moved so quickly they left a trail of reddish light behind them and no sound 
was ever heard other than representative Wallop there was other prominent Witnesses including the 
ranch owner Alan fordash Dr Robert Connell and an anonymous Air Force Major who is actually on 
leave from the Pentagon all of them were pilots by the way they immediately contacted the FAA the 
Federal Aviation Administration who told them that there were no known aircraft in the area 
the days following this incident at least two other groups of witnesses also reported seeing 
what appears to be the same objects ultimately representative Malcolm Wallop never spoke publicly 
about his sighting which received only brief mention in a small UFO publication called Data net 
so representative Wallop later Senator was best known for being a leading conservative 
Senator during the administration of Ronald Reagan healed office for quite a long time 
probably the most famous politician to claim a UFO sighting is of course Jimmy Carter who 
served as governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975 and of course president of the United States 
from 1977 to 1981. but it was a cold evening on January 6 1969 when he was beginning to 
consider running for governor when Carter and 10 other Witnesses were standing outside the Lions 
Club in Leary Georgia when they all saw a strange glowing orb and as Jimmy Carter says and I quote 
it seemed to move toward us from a distance stop move partially away return and then depart 
if you describe this object as bluish at first then reddish luminous not solid at times it was 
as bright as the moon and about as big as the moon maybe a bit smaller so he was interviewed about 
this many times in 1973 he told reporters there were about 20 of us standing outside a little 
restaurant I believe a High School lunchroom and a kind of green light appeared in the Western sky 
this was right after Sundown it got brighter and brighter and then it eventually disappeared 
it didn't have any solid substance to it it was just a very peculiar looking light none of us 
could understand what it was so he continued to be very vocal about this in 2005 he gave another 
interview in which he said and I quote all of a sudden one of the men looked up and said look 
over in the west and there was a bright light in the sky we all saw it and then the light that 
got closer and closer to us and then it stopped I don't know how far away but it stopped beyond the 
pine trees and all of a sudden it changed color to Blue and then it changed to Red then back to White 
we were trying to figure out what in the world it could be and then it receded into the distance 
so we did actually report his sighting to nycap the National investigative committee 
on aerial phenomena and has he said in another interview I don't laugh at people anymore when 
they say they've seen UFOs I've seen one myself it was the darndest thing I have 
ever seen was big it was bright it changed colors and it was about the size of the Moon 
and at one point during an interview he made a remarkable statement he said I have no 
idea what it was but I think it was a light beckoning me to run in the Georgia primary 
so could this have been an intentional sightings I will say that some Skeptics and debunkers such 
as Robert Shafer and James oberg have offered various explanations to explain away this 
sighting including everything from Venus to a quote barium Cloud released from Eglin AFB 
however Carver made it clear in his many statements that he believed it was a genuine UFO 
and in fact Jimmy Carter's mother Lillian Carter writes that the sighting had a profound effect 
on her son as Lillian Carter says in her own words the UFO made a huge impression on Jimmy 
he told me about the sighting many times he's always been a Down to Earth No Nonsense boy 
and the sighting by him as far as I was concerned is as firm as money in the bank 
so Jimmy Carter did become president and during his campaign to become president of the United 
States he actually promised to make public all the UFO information being held in secret by our 
own government as he said if I become president I'll make every piece of information this country 
has about UFO sightings available to the public and the scientists I am convinced that UFOs exist 
because I've seen one unfortunately for reasons we can only speculate upon but some have pointed 
to National Security concerns Carter did not fulfill this campaign promise however he did make 
another really interesting contribution towards this subject when the Voyager spacecraft was 
constructed and launched by the U.S this was in 1977 that Carter actually wrote a message directly 
to the ETS and I think this is an important enough message that I would like to read it for you 
and this is from Jimmy Carter as he says on this golden record that was sent out into space for the 
ETS this Voyager spacecraft was constructed by the United States of America we are a community of 240 
million human beings among the more than 4 billion who inhabit the planet Earth we human beings are 
still divided into nation-states but these states are rapidly becoming a single Global civilization 
we cast this message into the cosmos it is likely to survive a billion years into our 
future when our civilization is profoundly altered and the surface of the Earth may be vastly changed 
of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy some perhaps many may have inhabited planets 
and space-bearing civilizations if one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand 
these recorded contents here is our message this is a present from a small distant world 
a token of our sounds our science our images our music our thoughts and our feelings 
we are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours 
we hope someday to have solved the problems we Face to join a community of Galactic Civilizations 
This Record represents Our Hope and determination in our Goodwill in a vast and awesome universe 
signed Jimmy Carter president of the United States so I sometimes wonder if 
Jimmy Carter himself was a UFO contactee that's a really wonderful message I think to send out 
I also think it's quite interesting that it was just a short time later 
that there was another sighting by another Governor within the United States 
this occurred in October of 1973 when a huge wave of sightings was sweeping across Ohio 
and among the witnesses to the activity was the governor of Ohio John Gilligan while driving with 
his wife Katie near Ann Arbor Michigan they both observed an amber colored object remain 
in view for about a half an hour and at one point actually sent down a quote vertical beam of light 
this object was bright enough that it was visible through a cover of clouds and when the clouds 
broke up the object disappeared and when asked what he thought the object was governor Gilligan 
replied that he didn't know so this was headline news and was actually reported on by the famed 
newscaster Walter Cronkite and during a subsequent press conference Governor Gilligan was asked about 
his sighting and said I saw one the other night so help me I'm absolutely serious I saw this it 
was not a plane was not a bird it didn't wear a cape and I really don't know what it was 
so Arch debunker and skeptic Robert Shafer has tried to explain away the sighting as the planet Mars but does not explain how Mars can be visible through a cloud cover and send 
on a beam of light or suddenly disappear from View so clearly unusual and it was just one year 
later when one of the most famous politician UFO sightings occurred and that was in 1974 
when President Ronald Reagan then governor of California was taking a routine nighttime flight 
his Pilot was Bill painter and it was Bill painter who first revealed the details of 
this in an interview as pilot Bill painter says I was the pilot of the plane when we saw the UFO 
also on board were Governor Reagan and a couple of his security people we were near Bakersfield when Governor Reagan and others called my attention to a big light 
flying a bit behind my plane it appeared to be several hundred yards away it was a fairly steady 
light until it began to accelerate and then it appeared to elongate then the light took off it 
went up at a 45 degree angle from a normal Cruise speed to a fantastic speed instantly
and although this sighting was not very well known Reagan himself did confirm the details 
to Norman Miller who was then a Washington bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal 
Reagan actually told Norman Miller that after citing the object he ordered his 
Pilot Bill painter to follow it and as Ronald Reagan said we followed it for several minutes 
all of a sudden to our utter amazement and went straight up into the heavens 
when I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it and we read up on the long history of UFOs 
so when Norman Miller interviewed Reagan about this he was surprised that the governor was 
so candid and asked Reagan if he actually believed in UFOs and as Norman Miller says 
when I asked him that question a look of horror came over his face it suddenly dawned on him what 
he was saying the implications and that he was talking to a reporter he snapped back to reality 
and said let's just say that on that subject of UFOs I'm in agnostic So Reagan never gave 
any further interviews regarding his sighting but when he was president he did make several 
very provocative statements that revealed his possible belief in extraterrestrials and in 1985 
he made a very interesting enigmatic statement and I just like to play a little recording of 
it for you here I couldn't help at one point in my discussions with privately with General Secretary 
Gorbachev when you stopped a Thing That We're All God's Children wherever we may live in the world 
I couldn't help but say to him just think how easy his task and mind might be and these meetings that 
we held if suddenly there was a threat to this world from some other species from another planet 
outside in the universe we'd forget all the local differences that we have between our countries and 
we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings here on this Earth together 
well I don't suppose we can wait for some alien race to come down and threaten us 
but I think that between us we can bring about that realization it was two years later in 1987 
President Reagan again discussed the extra terrestrial presence again labeling it as a threat
in our obsession with antagonisms at the moment we often forget how much unites all the members of 
humanity perhaps we need some outside Universal threat to make us recognize this common bound 
I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish 
if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world and yet I ask you is 
not an alien force already Among Us and here is a third comment again from President Reagan
I think maybe I'd answer it this way I I keep in my frustrations sometimes you know actually if 
you count some of the things going on in smaller countries and all there have been about 114 Wars 
since World War II but I've often wondered what if all of us in the world discovered 
that we were threatened by an outer of power from outer space from another planet 
wouldn't we all of a sudden find that we didn't have any differences between us at all we were all human beings citizens of the world and wouldn't we come together to fight 
that particular threat a fourth comment was also revealed by Fred Barnes the senior editor of the 
News Republic newspaper and Fred Barnes overheard President Reagan speaking with Russian foreign 
minister Edward chevronazzi and President Reagan actually asked Minister shavard Nazi 
what would happen if the world faced a quote alien threat from outer space don't 
you think the U.S and the Soviet Union would join together and shavard Nazi replied absolutely yes 
so it's kind of a shame that Reagan is pushing forth this alien threat narrative 
I wonder about that it's clear to me that the alien threat is really to the power structure 
of our own politicians I don't think the threat is coming from outer space I think 
it's coming from right here on Earth and I will say that there is some reports that Reagan may 
have had even more extensive contact this is somewhat hearsay third hand but according to 
Lucille Ball and comedian Steve Allen before even entering politics Ronald and Nancy Reagan 
arrived one hour late to a Hollywood party being held by actor William Holden 
and Reagan allegedly I'll underline that told Lucille Ball and Steve Allen that 
he and Nancy had seen a UFO while driving along the Pacific Coast Highway in Southern California 
that's interesting to me because this is an area of extremely high UFO contact 
this was well before Reagan's first sighting and according to some accounts on this alleged 
incident this object actually landed however Reagan never spoke publicly about this at all 
actress Shirley McLean said that Reagan said he had actually met et's face to face and that 
they advised him to pursue a career in politics but again this aspect of Reagan's UFO contacts 
is somewhat controversial and has never been confirmed moving along on March 5 1977 
on interesting and virtually unknown case involves an unnamed North Dakota state senator and his wife 
who were allegedly chased by two UFOs outside of Valley City in North Dakota 
this report actually comes from a local sheriff who took the Senator's report shortly after the 
incident when the sheriff then reported the encounter to Bob Gribble at the National UFO 
Reporting Center and what I'd like to do now is just play a little audio clip 
from newfork in which this Sheriff talks about the North Dakota Senators encounter 
yeah this is the Sherman Valley City North Dakota yes sir yeah I was just uh I talked with a person 
last Saturday night and he said that he saw some strange objects in the sky over Valley City 
or in the area of Valley City I should say huh okay do you have a party's name yes he's uh he's a 
state senator okay and uh he would probably be in war in Bismarck North Dakota today he's a senator 
and they're in session right now and his wife was with him so she probably knows something about it 
too he says when they left about the Hastings area there was this ball just a big ball like 
you know flame that flowed him all the way to the outskirts of Valley and then they stopped 
their vehicle and uh and then his wife says well that's a nice one there but look on the other side 
of the car and there was another one and that one was supposed to be changing colors you know okay 
when did that occur Saturday evening Saturday okay which would be the uh the fourth or fifth right 
well sir we sure appreciate this call we'll get on this yeah let me know if you find anything will you all right sure we appreciate the call okay thank you so Bob Gribble told the sheriff 
that he would look into the sighting but as far as I know no information has been forthcoming 
another very famous case involving a U.S leader to see a UFO is none other than Congressman Dennis 
kucinich who is a U.S representative from Ohio and he admitted to seeing something he quote 
could not explain while staying at the home of actress Shirley McLean in 1982 in Washington 
and in her book saging while aging Charlene McLean basically outed Dennis kucinich and 
wrote and I quote he had a close sighting over my home in Graham Washington when I lived there 
Dennis found his encounter extremely moving the smell of fresh roses Drew him out to my balcony 
where when he looked up he saw a gigantic triangular craft silent and observing him 
it hovered soundless for 10 minutes or so and sped away he said he felt a connection in his heart and 
heard directions in his mind and during his failed Run for the U.S presidency kucinich talked about 
the sighting and admitted that he saw this UFO as he says I did it was an unidentified flying object 
it was something you have to keep in mind Jimmy Carter saw a UFO and more recently Dennis kucinich 
did appear on the History Channel and spoke publicly and extensively about his encounter so 
here's another pretty highly placed world leader who has come forward to talk about his encounters 
and more and more politicians are stepping forward another is former Arizona governor Fife Simington 
he was in office during the very famous Phoenix Lights incident in 1997. 
and at first did not reveal that he was in fact a witness a firsthand eyewitness 
however after he retired from office and became a pastry chef he to his credit did come forward and reveal his own experience with seeing the Phoenix Lights 
and I'd just like to give a pretty long quote from him because I think it's important what he says 
as Fife Simington says in his own words in 1997 during my second term as Governor of Arizona 
I saw something that defied logic and challenged my reality I witnessed a 
massive delta-shaped craft silently navigate over [ __ ] Peak a mountain range in Phoenix Arizona 
was truly breathtaking I was absolutely stunned because I was turning to the West looking for 
the distant Phoenix Lights and to my astonishment this Apparition appeared this dramatically large 
very distinctive Leading Edge with some enormous lights was traveling through the Arizona sky 
as a pilot and a former Air Force officer I can definitively say that this craft did not resemble 
any man-made object I've ever seen and it was certainly not high altitude flares because flares 
don't fly in formation the incident was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people in Arizona 
and my office was besieged with phone calls from very concerned arizonians 
the growing hysteria intensified when the story broke nationally and I decided to lighten the mood 
of the state by calling a press conference where my chief of staff arrived in an alien costume 
we managed to lessen the sense of panic but at the same time upset many of my constituents 
I would line that I would now like to set the record straight I never meant to ridicule 
anyone my office did make inquiries as to the origin of the craft but to this day they remain 
unanswered eventually the Air Force claimed responsibility stating that they dropped flares 
this is indicative of the attitude from official channels we get explanations that fly in the face 
of the facts explanations like weather balloons swamp gas and Military flares I was never happy 
with the Air Force's silly explanations there might very well have been military flares in 
the sky that evening but what I and hundreds of others saw had nothing to do with that I now know 
that I am not alone there are many high-ranking military Aviation and government officials who 
share my concerns while on active duty they have either witnessed a UFO incident or have 
conducted an official investigation into UFO cases relevant to Aviation safety and National Security 
by speaking out with me these people are putting their reputations on the line 
they're fought in Wars guarded top secret weapons arsenals and protected our nation's Skies 
we want the government to stop putting out stories that perpetuate the myth that all 
UFOs can be explained away in down to earth conventional terms investigations need to 
be reopened documents need to be unsealed and the idea of an open dialogue can no longer be shunned 
incidents like these are not going away about a year ago Chicago's O'Hare International Airport 
experienced a UFO event that made national and international headlines what I saw in the Arizona 
sky goes beyond conventional explanations when it comes to the events of this nature that are 
still completely unsolved we deserve more openness in government especially our own 
I couldn't agree more so those are the U.S leaders that I was able to find who have come forward with 
their own first-hand cases of UFO contact but of course the U.S is not alone with this heads of 
state across the world have joined the ranks of UFO Witnesses so let's go back in time a little 
bit to July 9 1952 a gentleman by the name of Oscar link who was a major in Hasselbeck 
Germany and the mayor of the town gleamershausen he and his daughter Gabrielle who is 11 years old 
were taking a motorcycle ride when their motorcycle got a flat tire 
so they were walking along and inside the woods Gabrielle noticed two men in quote shiny metallic 
clothing examining the ground in a clearing near what appeared to be a pink disc shaped object 
was about 13 to 15 meters in diameter and had a double row of openings around the rim 
portholes and a black turret on top and Oscar link said it looked like quote a huge frying pan so one 
of the men held a strange box which was flashing lights and uh link Oscar link began to approach 
the object but his daughter Gabrielle Cried Out In Fear And this actually alerted the figures to 
their presence on both of these figures promptly went inside the disk which began to vibrate making 
a loud humming noise then it spun faster and quote took off surrounded by a ring of flames 
and when they went to see where this object had landed there were distinct markings on the ground 
an Oscar link again a mayor speculated that perhaps he had seen a secret Soviet military 
test aircraft he had no knowledge of UFOs at the time it was only later that he speculated 
that perhaps this was in fact a landed UFO and extraterrestrials and later he learned that there 
were in fact several other Witnesses who had seen what was apparently the same object moving across 
the sky in the same area a very unusual case and again these are occurring all over the world 
in 1954 France experienced an unprecedented wave of UFO activity never before seen in their country 
and among the witnesses was Nasir Raul Lauren who was at that time the mayor of saint desier 
and on the evening of September 29 1954 mayor Laura Hall had just left City Hall 
and looking up in the stormy sky he observed a brightly glowing craft shaped he said like 
an elongated cigar moved upward over the city hall at a near 45 degree angle he said it was 
several kilometers in altitude but it moved so quickly it left a luminous trail behind it 
so very strange and here's a case which is not well known but apparently pretty well verified 
and the UFO witness in this case is none other than Fidel Castro who is the prime 
minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and the president of Cuba from 76 to 2008. 
prior to becoming prime minister Fidel Castro's fought in the Cuban Revolution of 1953-1959 
and it was during this time that Castro said that he and his fellow Cuban soldiers observed 
an unknown object which he described as round and enormous Fidel Castro was interviewed by 
UFO researcher Jose Luis gel and in this interview Fidel Castro said and I quote 
there we were in the middle of the night with our rifles on our knees then we suddenly saw a light 
Among the Stars the light approached the group of commanders and poured over us like a bucket 
he told researcher Jose Louis Gill and said and I quote it was round and enormous 
the countryside and the mountains became illuminated as though it was Daylight 
so it's a brief case but if true it provides yet another example of a major world leader 
experiencing UFO contact and it just goes on and on on August 3rd 2013 the Iranian 
politician Hassan Rouhani was sworn in as the seventh president of Iran he's 
an Islamic cleric a lawyer and a diplomat but he was President of Iran for eight years until 2021. 
and he gave an audio taped interview in June of 2020 in which he describes how a UFO landed 
next to him in 1955 or 1956 when he was just a little boy I'd like to read a direct quote 
from president Rouhani as he says in this interview I was in the second or third grade 
I was about eight or seven I got out of our house to get to the prayer at the mosque 
when I arrived at the mosque yard I felt as though a spotlight just lit up the whole yard and I felt 
that the light was coming from above I lifted my head and I saw something coming down from above 
and as far as I could remember it was an object with a mass of perhaps one by two by three meters 
was completely made of pure light I couldn't see anything other than The Shining Light 
coming from it and I saw it descend from above and land directly in the mosque yard 
and I felt as if this is a vehicle there are people inside it it stayed there for a few minutes 
and then it lifted off again and when it lifted off I started following it even though I was 
planning on going to the mosque I saw this thing move on to another mosque that was in the village 
which was about 300 meters apart from the first mosque I saw this quote hauda which is a vehicle 
land in the other mosque and I was running in the alley to get to it 
and when I got there I saw it lift up from the mosque yard and Ascend into the sky I was watching 
it leave and it left our village and I got back to the mosque but I had missed the morning prayer 
so this is a really startling admission of an actual UFO landing by a President 
very very interesting and another case comes from the former president of Mexico Louis echeverria 
he was president of Mexico from 1970 to 1976. and Mexican UFO researcher Pedro Feliz interviewed 
president echeveria who told him quote I have seen a UFO it was in 1974 during the fourth year 
of his term that echeveria revealed his sighting to a group of broadcasters and he described his 
sighting saying that he and his wife were on the Terrace of their home in Cuernavaca when 
they saw a bright illuminated object what he called quote a Mothership hovering above the 
Horizon as echeveria said the craft didn't move from there what's interesting because immediately 
following this sighting the city of Cuernavaca suffered a widespread electrical blackout 
researcher Antonio hunis researched this incident it apparently took place on September 23rd 1965. 
but it turned out that president echeveria was not the only Mexican government official to see 
the object Valentin Lopez Gonzalez the mayor of Cuernavaca and Emilio Riva Palacio the governor 
of the state of Morelos were also among the eyewitnesses as were several other highly 
placed military and Business Leaders at the time echeveria was the Secretary of interior of Mexico 
and he had previously held the office of Secretary of Navy and later of course become the president 
of Mexico itself so a really interesting case and leaders across the world are seeing UFOs 
in a bizarre case occurred in 1971 and this involves a president of Uganda this involves 
Ugandan military officer and we now know that this man is Idi Amin 
he held office in 1979 and he is considered by many political historians to be one of the most 
brutal despots in human history and in fact it is estimated that somewhere between 100 
000 to 500 000 people were killed under his regime earning him terrible nicknames such as the Butcher 
of Africa and black Hitler however uh he is also allegedly a UFO Witness in 1973 while visiting 
Kampala in Uganda President Edie Amin observed a strange object surrounded by a smoke-like cloud 
descend onto the surface of Lake Victoria where it hovered for about seven minutes before gracefully 
lifting off and ascending into the sky again like a gentle rocket his sighting received an enormous 
amount of publicity in the country and over the radio president Idi Amin told listeners that 
this object was a quote great significance and a sign of good luck to Uganda many other Witnesses 
also saw the object and president Amin said that all those who had seen it should attend prayers 
so the list of world leaders who have seen UFOs is longer than many people realize in March of 1974 
Monsieur Petit who was then the mayor of ramonia France was one of many people in the small town 
who saw a UFO it was around 10 30 p.m when many of the residents of Ramon saw a shiny orange oval 
disc hovering overhead remained motionless for about 10 minutes then moved away bit by bit before 
disappearing Over the Horizon among the strangest of accounts coming from a world leader I think is 
that of Sir Eric Gary the prime minister of the small island country of Granada Sir Eric Gary was 
first elected prime minister of Granada following its independence from Great Britain and he was 
chief minister from 1961 to 1962 and became prime minister of independent Granada from 1967 to 1974. 
and it was during his term that prime minister Gary had a dramatic UFO encounter 
this account was first published in UFO digest and was written by Wesley Bateman who interviewed Eric 
Gary first hand as The Story Goes Erica Gary was allegedly taking grievances from local 
citizens and was approached by a fisherman who said that he came upon a strange craft 
and a deceased ET body which had actually washed up upon the shore of the small island country 
Eric Gary in a small group of his associates traveled to the location and were amazed to 
see a giant humanoid body almost eight feet tall it had a pale white complexion long white braided 
hair and six fingers on each hand it wore a skin tight blue one piece suit much like a scuba diver 
and surrounding the body was actually a metallic wreckage of various shapes and 
sizes including about eight metal containers and when opened these containers were found 
to hold various specimens from the area including fish plant life coral and sand 
Gary and his group gathered the wreckage and the body and moved it to the local Medical College 
where they remained until allegedly being taken following the U.S invasion of Granada in 1983. 
so it's prior to this and apparently as the result of his encounter that prime minister Gary 
entreated the United Nations to form a UFO study organization he began pushing for this in 1976. 
but his speech in 1978 is probably best remembered as he spoke about attempting to contact 
ETS how to do it and the implications of open official contact for all of humanity 
this proposal ultimately was not followed and later Britain released a statement which said 
and I quote the British delegation does not think that the establishment of an agency 
for Research into unidentified flying objects is appropriate to the functions of the United Nations 
hopefully a confrontation with the representatives of Granada can be avoided 
but the UK the UK should not hesitate to make its views known as and when appropriate 
I could not disagree more I think the United Nations is absolutely appropriate to research 
UFOs and the Extraterrestrial presence but the UK did not agree and this did not go well 
it was during the meeting at the United Nations that prime minister Gary said and I quote I know 
that flying saucers exist because I myself saw one three years ago so that would be 1975 and 
as he continues U.N diplomats will not think I'm crazy for saying so I am convinced that 
persons from outer space are studying us or perhaps living among us as Earthlings 
so it was Sir Eric Gary's push for openness on the subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials that 
may have actually led to his downfall because it was one year later in 1979 that a British lawyer 
by the name of Maurice Bishop enacted a hostile takeover of the government of Granada actually 
deposed Sir Eric Gary and forcibly seized control of the country following this Gary went to the 
United States and was allegedly closely surveilled by the NSA ultimately the only lasting result 
was that 1978 became known as the year of the UFO and led to the creation of four UFO themed postal 
stamps mind you the island of Granada is less than 135 square miles and the official reason for the 
U.S invasion of this tiny country in 1983 was the threat allegedly posed to American Nationals 
by coincidence or not particularly students at the Medical College there which was coincidentally the 
alleged resting place of the ET artifacts and body so I think there's probably a connection there 
that's pure speculation but it seems odd that this tiny little country would be worth invading 
at any rate there are other world leaders who have seen UFOs such as Fernando Enrique cardosa he was 
the president of Brazil from 1995 to 2003 and back in 1979 cardosa was taking a taxi ride along the 
coast to the city of Sierra Brazil with his wife Ruth and the Brazilian Ambassador celso Furtado 
and during the drive cardosa and Furtado both spotted a glowing object hovering over the ocean 
they first thought it was a helicopter until it suddenly moved vertically and then horizontally 
at high speed cardosa's wife didn't see the object which moved rapidly away but at the time of his 
sighting cardosa's political career had just become and he was about to become a senator in 
Sao Paulo later celso Furtado gave an interview revealing the sighting just a few years later and 
only recently as former president cardoso talked about this sighting and during an interview on 
the Brazilian television he absolutely confirmed this sighting saying I quote me and celso saw the 
flying disc so again I am not sure if this is a coincidence I think these world leaders are being 
presented with an opportunity to do the right thing and are being given direct contact intentionally here's another case from the president of the Republic of kalnikia in Russia 
this was from 1993 to 2010 that kirstan ilyamzanov was President of the Republic of calmikia 
and in a television interview he revealed that he was actually visited by 
ETS on September 18 1997 and that he was pulled from his apartment in Moscow actually onto a 
spacecraft where he communicated face to face with extraterrestrials wearing yellow jumpsuits 
and as kirstan says in his own words I believe I talked to them and saw them I 
perhaps wouldn't believe it if it wasn't for three Witnesses my driver my Minister and my assistant 
during his televised interview he elaborated and said I was taken from my apartment in Moscow to 
this spaceship and we went to some star and after that I asked them please bring me back there are 
people like us they have the same mind the same vision I talked with them and I understand that 
we are not alone in this world we are not unique I'm not a crazy man but after I gave the first 
interview to radio freedom in Russia thousands not hundreds thousands of people wrote me letters and 
called me on the phone saying oh kirstan you are a politician and you are not afraid to talk about it 
it was not in our Russian space vehicles but with aliens they came in a flying saucer picked me up 
and I spent a whole day in outer space it was from my apartment they flew in and picked me up 
they were wearing yellow spacesuits I remember this moment exactly we went off to their 
interplanetary ship and I started to feel a lack of air a lack of oxygen they gave me a 
spacesuit as well one of the aliens pointed to his chest and indicated that the oxygen supply 
could be regulated by turning a dial so this is what I did the ship was absolutely enormous 
one of its Chambers was the size of a large football pitch we landed on one of the planets 
and picked up some piece of equipment they told me everything in detail I asked them to take me 
back to Earth as quickly as possible because in two days I had to conduct Youth Government week 
and they brought me back and everything was normal again a few days later I was talking and thinking 
why did they take me and I was cursing myself for not asking them any questions 
but it is possible that it is still not time for us to meet these extraterrestrial civilizations 
so the Russian government showed quite a bit of interest in this and in a statement to the Huffington Post former mufon director Jan harzen writes
is one Russian politician who publicly discussed UFOs and culturally it apparently was not a 
disaster whether he's outspoken about UFOs from experience or just for publicity and 
attention we don't know but it's rather unusual when you compare him to American politicians 
here in the U.S it is still political disaster for a politician to to discuss UFOs from a personal 
point of view so the Russian officials were not happy about this and again they took a story 
very seriously and in fact Andre lebedev of the Russian Parliament wrote a letter to the president 
of Russia Dimitri Medvedev demanding that ilium submit to a state interrogation to reveal any 
information he shared with the ETS so there you go that's a long list of world leaders who have 
come forward and talked firsthand about their own UFO encounters and while it's a pretty long list 
I expect you could times it by 10 or a hundred because the vast majority of people do not talk 
about their sightings and I bet this is especially true for people who hold political office because 
as we have seen it's usually not to a politician's benefit to go public with their encounters some 
have bravely done so and not suffered negative consequences but some certainly have Francis 
barwood was a city councilwoman and really the only one holding office of any level who talked 
publicly about the Phoenix Lights of 1997. she didn't even see them she hadn't seen a UFO and 
yet she was mercilessly ridiculed by the press and eventually lost her seat as a city councilwoman 
and there's another case involving a Florida politician by the name of Bettina Rodriguez 
and in 2018 she ran for Congress and was doing quite well she was recommended by several 
newspapers as the leading candidate from her state and yet then she went public with her first-hand 
experiences with ET contact human looking ETS and her campaign spiraled downward from there 
and certainly when Dennis kucinich talked about his sighting during a presidential campaign 
this did not appear to help his campaign at all so I think it could be tantamount 
to political suicide to come forward or used to be but now is the time for truth 
and transparency on this subject there's no more room for lies on when it comes to UFOs 
people need to tell the truth and I think especially our world leaders need to gather 
their courage and just talk about this truthfully and transparently I did cover all these cases in 
my book not from here volume 4. so if you'd like to learn more about it yeah check that 
out I think you might enjoy it but until next time I really appreciate you watching 
and keep asking questions keep searching for the truth and most important keep having fun.
