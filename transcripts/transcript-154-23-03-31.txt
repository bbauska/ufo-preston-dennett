INTERVIEW WITH A UFO EXPERIENCER AND FILMMAKER JOHN YOST
Mar 31, 2023

Summary:
Mar 31, 2023
In 1973, seven-year-old John Yost of Pittsburgh, PA had an experience that would alter the course 
of his life forever. He awoke in the middle of the night and went to the bathroom to get a drink 
of water. As he stood in front of the sink, something very strange happened.

Looking in the doorway, he saw a strange figure. He could hardly believe his eyes. It was 
Ultraman, a superhero character from one of his favorite TV shows. What was Ultraman doing 
in his house? How did he get there? What did he want?

John stared in shock. This was impossible. And yet it was happening. He had no fear, until 
suddenly, John felt a strange sinking feeling, like the floor was coming out from under him. 
Dazzling colored lights began swirling around him. Sensing danger, he began to fight.

Without warning, there was a strange shift. John had been standing in the bathroom facing 
Ultraman, who stood in the hallway above the stairs. Now their positions were reversed. How 
had this happened. Ultraman reached forward and placed his hand on John’s shoulder. John 
found himself tumbling head over heels down the wooden staircase.

He screamed in fear, waking up his parents who rushed out of their bedroom to find John at 
the bottom of the stairs. He tearfully told them what happened. Puzzled and alarmed, they 
quickly searched the house for any intruders. There was no sign of Ultraman. They were all 
baffled and had no logical explanation.

The next day, John went outside to play. After returning home, his mom checked to make sure 
that he was okay and saw a strange mark on his shoulder, precisely where Ultraman had placed 
his hand. “What’s this?” she asked.

John explained that Ultraman had touched him on that spot. Shortly later, John’s father took 
him to the doctor. He told John not to tell the doctor anything about this Ultraman nonsense. 
And when John let it slip out, his father became angry and made it very clear that John was 
never to talk about Ultraman again.

John was a good boy, and obeyed his parents. From this point on, he buried this memory and 
never told anyone about it. It became his deep dark secret, something that no one could ever 
know.

Life continued on as normal. He grew up, and started a career with the Department of the 
Treasury. One day he realized that this was not what he wanted to do with his life; instead 
he wanted to work in the television and film industry. He quit his job and pursued his dreams. 
He was very successful and enjoyed a wonderful career making commercials, TV shows of all kinds, 
and working with many famous people in show business. He was happy.

Then one day, he was in Borrego Springs, CA working on a new project. Work had ended for the day, 
and he and his crew were enjoying the evening and watching the beautiful desert skies studded 
with stars when somebody showed, “Look, what’s that!” A brilliant light hung in the sky. It was 
a UFO!

John felt a sudden, strange sinking feeling. He recognized the feeling. He was instantly 
transported to age 7, when he had his face-to-face encounter with Ultraman. Panic swept over 
him and he fled to his room, where he broke down crying. What was happening to him? Why was 
this sighting affecting him so profoundly? What did this have to do with Ultraman?

John struggled with anxiety, fear and confusion. Something very significant was happening to 
him and he needed answers. He began to do research. The only explanation that seemed to fit 
was that he was a UFO experiencer. He finally sought out hypnosis. His memories came roaring 
back. Now he knew what happened to him.

Realizing that he was not alone, and that there were likely millions of people out there 
struggling with these same experiences, John decided to document his journey in the only 
way he knew how, with film. He began working on a documentary, chronicling his experiences 
and those of several others. And so the film Alien Abduction Answers was born. Creating 
the documentary was a labor of love. Different from most documentaries on the subject, 
John’s film was not told from the viewpoint of an expert on the subject, but from his own 
perspective as an experiencer. 

In 2022, the film was released to the public. It instantly began earning rave reviews and 
awards of excellence. John found himself at the forefront of the UFO field. Suddenly he 
was a sought-after presenter at UFO conventions, film festivals, UFO radio shows and 
podcasters and more.

This interview presents John Yost’s journey from his childhood encounter with Ultraman, 
his adult awakening as a UFO experiencer, his search for truth, and the completion of his 
award-winning documentary. 

To learn more about John’s journey from confusion and fear to hope and curiosity, check 
out his documentary, Alien Abduction Answer. Now available on multiple platforms.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. And welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
doing something a little different today I don't think I've ever done this quite 
before but I've gone on a couple of guests Dolly saffron you know she's the subject of my book 
symmetry A true UFO Adventure she's a lifelong contact D fully conscious has not needed hypnosis 
to recover her memories she lives them live as they occur and has had a lifetime of experiences 
with Grays tall whites and many other different types of ETS healing events she learned how to 
Pilot the craft well you probably know this if you've watched my YouTube channel done a bunch of interviews with Dolly so welcome Dolly thank you and also as you can see we do have another 
guest and this is John Yost who has made quite a recent Splash in this field with his film 
his documentary alien abduction answers which I haven't seen yet I do plan to see it but we have 
him here so he can tell us all about it I do know it's been pretty well received with great reviews 
by let's see Kathleen Martin and Jacque Valley and certainly Whitley streber and Grant Cameron 
so yeah he's making the rounds he's having an effect I think that's why I'm absolutely 
honored to have him on the show so thank you very much John for coming on the show I uh I am very 
grateful to both Dolly and to yourself sir for sharing your time and I thank your viewers as well thank you thank you I have great kudos for anyone who steps into this field searching for 
answers and helping to publicize it and educate people so I'm absolutely delighted to have you 
thank you sir um I thought we would just start how I always you want to interview someone I've 
interviewed a lot of people I'm just fascinated by a person's own experiences and what Drew them into this field so I thought we could start with that because I do believe you had some of your own 
personal experiences with I'll call the phenomena even though I really don't like that word 
I think these are just human experiences that millions of people are having so yeah I'm interested to see how yours started and what you thought of it well uh first off I I 
think that you're you have your finger right on it I I do think it is a human experience I think that 
it is prolific I think that what we're going to find out is most of us have had a brush with other 
and either through denial or through ignorance or through fear we haven't recognized it some of 
it is purposeful and some of it is unconscious resistance to it so I I think you're supremely 
correct in that sir I was completely surprised by that I would have told you I would have scoffed at 
the entire situation and my sarcastic retorts were really a defensive mechanism on my part
what had happened was this I was seven years old and I grew up in Pennsylvania 
and I was born in 1966. and in August of 1974 when I was seven years old 
I was awakened in the middle of the evening now I lived in my parents home of course on the second 
floor my family was not wealthy so we didn't have central air conditioning or anything like that 
the windows were open and I had been awakened by this drone if you will and I'll embarrass 
myself by making the noise it was kind of like this undulating drone like a um
that sort of thing and um I I sat up and I was I was Disturbed I was angry I was tired 
I'd been playing all day right seven years old it was summer it was summer vacation 
and um I kind of wiped the sleep from my eyes and I went to the bathroom and you know I'm getting a 
glass of water and the water is pouring for a very long time and I don't understand why that's happening I I remember noting that it was taking too long and I don't know why 
and then at some point I turned off the water and I went to the bathroom door and I opened the door 
now something incredible happened in that doorway facing me my seven-year-old mind told me I was 
looking at a character I'd seen a thousand times on television a character named Ultra Man 
now he had it's a Japanese television show and he was a giant silver guy with an oblong head 
and these huge eyes and and I loved Ultraman I have to tell you something I love he was a hero of mine I thought he would you know he fought the bad guys and the monsters and so I dug Ultraman 
um so there was no fear and um we got very very close and I mean honestly like nose to nose 
and then something happened I I felt myself falling and in the way I the way I describe 
it is this if you were some of your audience have ever been on a beach and the water comes 
up over your ankles and as it goes back out as it Retreats back to the water it slowly pulls away 
the sand underneath and you feel it like you're falling backwards that's the way you felt for me 
and I was petrified I was I was very terrified and I flailed like like a drowning man and when 
I did I literally laid hands on this character I and there was this huge flash of light and I 
felt like I was moving into all this life and I saw green and blue and purple and magenta and all this and I'm I'm I'm I'm whirling around I felt like I was moving but I could not tell and I'm 
looking and I can't see and then I'm in the middle of this thing and as I kind of come back to my 
senses I am still in this fight but something very strange has happened I am now kind of interpolated 
with this Ultraman I am now with my back in the hallway and his back is in the bathroom 
and um I I there's a split second there where I'm like what the heck has happened you know but I'm 
in the middle of this and I go to hit him and what I do and I say him I don't know is it him you know 
this Ultraman guy he raises his hand he touches me right here on my on my left shoulder and what 
he does there's this brilliant flash of light I feel this energy in my shoulder and my chest 
and that's almost like you know if you're standing you know halfway into an ocean and a wave hits you in the chest and knocks you down you know down that's the way I felt 
behind me are these hardwood stairs that go that lead to the first floor and I fall 
ugly I mean up and over and banging off walls and this and I lay in a heap on the bottom Landing 
and um I am screaming my head off I like a banshee and my parents they had a first floor 
bedroom they'd come running around they see me and my father he's a big guy and he says 
you know what the hell is going on and I'm saying screaming you know through sobs there's Ultraman 
upstairs he's in my bedrooms my father bounds up the stairs my mom is looking at her son just 
in a heap and I'm sobbing and I'm sobbing so much that I can't really speak you know like you can't 
catch your breath and she's trying to console me of father my father's slamming doors upstairs 
and after some time he comes to the top of the stairs and he looks down and he's he's just I 
mean he's over tired he's disgusted he's upset because of course there's nothing there right 
right so uh my parents after some time take me to the top of the stairs and take me into my room 
and they do what parents do you know they look in the closet right there's nothing in the closet 
they look under the bed see there's nothing and they uh they lie me down and uh I'm I'm kind of 
still whimpering but I am so exhausted at this point and the only thing I can surmise is that 
you know all that adrenaline pumping through my body just wiped me out and I just passed out 
well the next day I have to date myself um you know kids today you can't get them off a 
sofa because they're you know with their screens but you know back in the 70s during the summer vacation you grabbed a waffle and you ran outside and you played all day until your mom called you 
in for dinner that was the way it was yeah and uh and that's what I did and I I felt like I had 
been beaten up but you know I just played the day and my mom called me in for dinner and and 
she said listen you're disgusting it was it was uh it was August as I said it was very very humid 
and so she's I don't want to take a bath you know I'm a little boy and and she struggled 
with me with my t-shirt and she's looking at all the contusions and the bruises on my body 
and she gets to my left shoulder and she pauses and she says oh my God honey what happened here
and I I'm looking around and I'd say my mom I told you was an alternate 
she looked very sad and she gave a little kiss on the forehead said it'll be okay it'll be okay 
a couple of days later my father is taking me to a family doctor 
and we're pulling into the parking lot and he says to me now listen when we get in there 
I don't want to hear anything about this Ultraman guy okay you keep that to yourself 
and you know as I stated a couple times I'm seven years old so I have no idea the import 
of this why I would not tell him whatever but I said okay dad you know I love my dad sure 
and um so the doctor is doing a cursory look and remember this a couple days later so all of my 
bruises are yellowing and you know healing this sort of thing and and he gets to my shoulder my left shoulder and he says oh sport what the heck happened here 
and I start to blur it up well you know there was this guy my father is in the corner and he is 
given me you know the eye the eye and once again I wasn't afraid of my dad but I mean you know 
back in the 70s your father gave you the eye you know what the heck that meant shut your darn mom 
anyway um so I uh I said um well I was just playing I got hurt I don't know 
and so the doctor he took some time with it uh the mark and um he manipulated it and uh 
tried to see if it was liquid and it asked me if it hurt you know and so on and so on and then afterwards she gave me a lollipop and I walked out the door 
um my dad we were returning home and as we pulled into the driveway 
my parents home uh my father took a different tone with me and he said now listen the Lord is 
voice he said no listen to me I never ever want to hear about this Ultraman guy again who shut 
your damn mouth I don't want to hear I don't want you scaring your mother I don't want you scared your sisters you shut up about it very sternly and that and that's the first moment 
that I felt afraid you know what I mean like almost like I had done something wrong right 
and um I you know and I have no idea of why this is or whatever and I said no it's short okay Dad 
but now I mean I got it before I didn't get it I got it this time and so I lied about it my entire 
life now people have said to me well well you know come on you're a teenager young man well this is 
what happened it evolved into something you know I'm looking at at Dolly and she's wearing glasses 
and so this is what I I want to share with you how this is It's almost like muscle memory you know this morning you didn't get up and say hmm I determine it's uh a good idea if I should see 
clearly today so I shall put my spectacles on that never happened that process never happened 
what happened is you sat up and rubbed your eyes and said oh crap I can't see anything put them on right that was it you didn't think about it so I lied all through my childhood and then I was very 
active in sports in high school and University and you know people would say hey guys what the heck and I a shark bit me I get hit by lightning somebody shot me you could just go back for 
a second so you was this a Mark that stayed on your shoulder that you can visibly see or it's 
Yes actually in the film you see it it's it's very raised it's uh it changes color it changes 
temperature it's um a lot of people say they see a different shape in the film we outline it so 
everybody can see it but I mean it's raised I I it to me to me personally it looks like a thumb print 
but it's large I have big hands and it's like maybe an inch and a half long is it ever painful 
no all right never painful scanned out of it I'm sorry did you have a stand done no no I never did 
I never did and I'll I'll explain why in a second here um so a few more quick questions yes sir yes 
sir you know when you see the this Ultraman guy uh was he short was he your height or Paul or good 
good call one of the things that I remarked uh and I have remarked other people is that uh kind of 
the surprising thing is is that I was the smallest kid in my class until High School and Ultraman 
was this giant and he was as big as me so he was little we were eye to eye literally these two tiny 
people and was he an accurate representation of oh yes yes I saw I saw a miniature alternate he was 
silver he had the same sort of eyes everything did you have mental communication with him and 
did you hear him talk at that moment no no and and and I I think honestly I think that those 
these these kind of clarifications are going to come into the second part of this thing uh I'll 
I'll tell you the rest and I think oh you'll say oh well that's the answer that's why all right but before you do let me I just do have a few quick comments interesting you say H7 because I've heard 
that age come up quite a bit and this sounds to me like a screen memory yes I'm sure you've probably 
heard it this time because I have heard people describe teddy bears clowns superheroes Barbie 
dolls yes sir so here you say Ultraman kind of fits in with some of the stories I have heard 
of other people yes sir I do find that interesting and so this experience wasn't at all scary for you 
well up into the point when I felt myself slipping and then all of the lights and the 
flashing and then I was literally I'm telling you I laid my hands on this character right 
you know in in a struggle all right did you have any dreams or anything following that incident 
about you know without that incident many times all right can you share what they were about
um all of them all of them were just a recounting over and over again of these steps and I could 
in my dream I said to myself don't open that bathroom door don't open that bathroom door 
he's out there he's out there don't do it don't do it and all of my dreams were
unsatisfactory in that they all ended in that kind of dervish the whirling lights 
that I could not I could not understand and I was frustrated because I was struggling to try 
to understand was I moving what those lights were or what why I felt this way like I was falling 
um yeah they were just very unsatisfied have you had any inclination or have you had to come to 
you about what was actually happening since then in other words have you made sense of it since
I I
yes that's why I made the film I'm not trying to be I'm not trying to 
obfuscate in fact I want to tell you the rest uh but but what what had happened was 
and I think this is key and what this it'll all make sense if you allow me to just tell you this little Keystone then you'll go oh that makes and then these answers will fall into place so so what 
had happened is I lied all my life I lied to my wife I lied to my kids never told anybody 
and the evolution of that obfuscation changed from my dad told me to anything that I mean anything in 
the world could have been better to say than hey you know what I was abducted I didn't want to do 
that I would lost credibility I would have lost friends about I was certain and that was kind of 
like this Touchstone that I did not want to get close to the older I became and then you know 
it was always I don't want to say it was front of mind it was a very clear memory I always had absolute Clarity except for you know that whirling and how we got interpolated and uh that leads me 
to present day so throughout my life I to my best knowledge I never had any other encounters right
about three and a half years ago four years ago I was on a shoot a regular shoot uh this is what I have to share with you so I grew up went 
to school University I you uh I worked under the jurisprudence of the Treasury Department 
um I was a U.S customs broker I traveled the world I moved people intellectual properties and money 
amongst all kinds of different nations and navigated all the trade agreements throughout these nations and paid duties and taxes Etc um I did that for 10 years federally licensed under 
the commissioner of uh of the U.S treasury Department and it just lost its juice and it 
became a job at job and I always had a dream of being in film and television so this is 
shoot 35 years ago I'm an old guy anyway so I got yeah I got involved in film and television and so 
I've done a ton of stuff in front of the camera I've directed I've produced I've written you know 
all across the country so real quick what types of things were you writing and producing sure great 
job uh sure uh you as a sidebar you can find me on imdb.com and you can see all kinds of stuff uh 
but most of my stuff is just run-of-the-mill like uh did the stuff that you'd find on Food Channel 
stuff that you find on History uh you know battle the Bulge World War II cooking shows I did the 
thousands it's not 3 000 commercials for all kinds of different things everything from attorneys to 
car dealers to you know credit cards to whatever I mean I'm just a guy in the business I was never 
a star don't want to be a star think of me like a blue collar worker I don't I don't own IBM but I'm 
that guy who makes the printed circuit board so I work for IBM right so that's that's what I did so 
you would have seen it or bumped into it at some point because they were all across the country 
um so I was on a shoot a regular run-of-the-mill shoot and I was producing uh in a place called 
Borrego Springs California I don't know if you've ever been there but it's very flat 
it's very arid as you know then and we had rented this big house to uh keep the crew and the cast 
all together because you know it's like herding cats I don't think people get lost out there and 
um we had done a night shoot and come back in it's late you know 1 30 2 o'clock in the morning 
and I'm inside with the crew and we're making sure that we have duplicates of all the film because 
you know we don't want to go to the different Coast to do editing and somebody lose something the rest of everybody there were about 15 people with us 17 people with us and they were out there 
was a pool behind the house that we rented and they were having a night cap so I I walk out 
at some point and somebody hands me a glass and they're gonna make a toast so I raise my glass 
and there's a glint of light in the glass and in my mind my mind is immediately trying to 
identify what I saw and I said uh well that's the moon you know that system and then I went wait a second I checked myself I said wait a second that's not the moon tonight's the 
full moon I know because I can't I set the shoot up so we could control the lights we have these big light Banks so we can control the light there's no moon out tonight and I dropped 
my glass and as I drop my glass I see above the house I'm facing the house the pool's behind me 
above the house about 30 feet in the air is this kind of blue green self-luminous odd shaped thing
and I I'm do you remember that old show um uh was it Lost in Space it does not compute does not this 
is my mind like what the hell is that and then my mind is searching for you know an association and 
I say oh that's a that's a get well ballooned like a mylar balloon like a get well or a happy birthday and then my mind checks myself again says no that is as big as a Volkswagen 
but the and one of my camera guys Scotty was sitting right here and I grab him and I turn him and he says oh my God and as he does the rest of the people around the pool 
say oh my God what is that is that a UFO oh my God is that a kite is that a drone 
by all this other stuff this whole Buzz is happening now this little Preamble talk 
six seconds this is going on and as this is we all focus our attention on this thing 
and as I am focused on it it zigzags and I mean to tell you I have never in 
my life seen anything move that damn fast it's exact and stopped right above my head
and I don't know how long it was there I don't know if it was like a second or a minute I I don't know I don't know but something occurred in that instant 
that feeling of the sand slipping out from under my feet 
Jarred me I had not felt that feeling like that since I was a little boy of seven oh wow 
and I became immediately terrified and I when I say when I say afraid I mean like 
this kind of afraid I don't know if you have ever been this cold or this afraid or this you know embarrassed this hungover where you're inside your literal organs are shaking 
and that's the way I was and then it kind of zipped about 20 feet away everybody is still 
talking oh my god do you see this how fast it moves blah blah blah and then it just drifts off into the desert and there were like I said there were like 15 17 people there looking at 
it all talking about it and it was very flat so we could watch it and then eventually it blinked out 
people are humming about it and one of you have a camera of course not all the cameras 
and everything else are inside right I just told you we were downloading all this stuff we figured we were you know done for the day and the shoot had nothing to do with any of this stuff I mean 
so I am I am dying inside and I make some stupid comment to everybody I say 
well you young whippersnappers can hang out all night and drink I I've got I've 
got business to do I got to write reports and uh I went to the room that was mine
and I barricaded the door took I took the bed and I slid it across the room and I took all my luggage and I 
threw it up on top of the bed and I sat in a corner on the floor and I bawled my eyes out
and it was horrible and you have to understand that this was not a 50 year old guy 
dealing with something this was a seven-year-old kid who had never dealt with anything 
and so it was horrible and the more I cried the more angry I became 
and let me push in on that a little bit in my business okay as a producer 
you have to be very left brain live very very anal retentive you know boxes being checked you 
know you're moving a lot of money usually it's not yours so you know of course the audit Trail has to be perfect you have to be very you have to be really on top of it and me losing control 
is unacceptable unacceptable and I'm really good at my job so I was enraged with myself 
and I realized I could not show this to anyone of course nobody knows about me and my dark secret 
and I didn't I didn't really connect these two things all I just I just knew that that 
was the same feeling and so the next morning I didn't sleep at all next morning I took a 
hot shower I was angry I was gonna go outside I was gonna kick ass right and I grab a coffee 
and I go to the sliding doors and I cannot walk outside I am inexplicably petrified of Big Sky 
you can't do it just and now now I am so angry I am so livid at myself unforgiving
I'm forced to embarrass myself and wake up two guys who because I had to go look for 
um locations that day I could go inside I have to go with two guys now their gun is looking 
at me a little side eye because they I've worked I've worked for Rhino I've been in the business 
for over 33 years but I've worked for this present production company rhino pictures 
for 13. these people know me very very well and they even made some silly remark about well John 
you're just you're not going to listen to our opinions anyway why are you making us go and uh 
so I somehow get through the last three days of the shoot and thanks to 
some very strong triple distilled Irish whiskey I make it back to the coast
but when I get off the plane my family and friends they they know something's wrong 
with me it got so bad Preston that I would get to work very early and wait right beside the door in 
my truck and wait for somebody to come so I can run out and walk with him inside the building 
uh I couldn't help you alone under that sky and um okay I mean like what why what's going through 
here nothing blind Terror blind Terror blind Terror no no at this point you have to understand 
I am not and this is what this whole film is about it's about me trying to cope with this and trying 
to figure this out you know you're in a full-blown existential crisis right a hundred percent I I 
I I could not and and here's the thing a smarter person a smarter person would have looked for help 
I'm not a smart guy well that has nothing to do with anything when you're in the middle of a crisis you're boxed in you're internalized and you can't see outside of yourself at all you're 
you're reeling with a a playing real as you will of a movie that you've been playing and playing 
playing your entire life and it's really hard to turn that movie off when you're in crisis so 
yeah it has nothing to do with fear has nothing to do with how smart you are at all it has to 
do with whether you're done with it or not yet and people don't realize that a crisis means you 
have to evolve through the crisis and when you're done with it then you start looking outward and 
you start evaluating so okay go on so well before you do could I sorry sorry John but I'm curious 
um because you know we had this experience at age seven um how did you interpret that did you just not think about it did you think at any point this was ET related until I mean when did you 
start Connecting the Dots here but I I I knew that it was something other but to me the category or 
the bucket that I put it in was it was a bully it was a bully wow I got beat up by a bully that was 
it and I don't know if you've ever been picked on Preston but like I said I was the smallest 
kid in my class until high school so I had ample opportunity to be picked on it was just one of 
those things oh now now this fear uh by the way thank you very much dolly for your comments you 
you possess something I do not which is wisdom and in that particular State I had no wisdom at all 
um so and this was this was um compounded because I am no longer the smallest kid in my class I'm 
about six three and 270 pounds so I very rarely feel uncomfortable or or nervous around anything 
right uh and for me to feel that kind of unmitigated fear is intolerable intolerable 
and um so I was very very it started to poison everything I touched I I couldn't communicate with 
people I was shut down I'm you know I'm usually a very outgoing guy because of my business I I 
couldn't really talk I had problems I had a lot of problems and so the position I took was when 
I finally said you know I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired right so I said look
you were not as smart this is where I this is where I was singing I know Dolly you and I differ on this but let me just say this because it'll make sense to you I think I said 
look you are nobody special you are nothing smart there must be people with experiences 
like this there must now I'm not and unlike Preston I'm not interested at this point in 
my story I'm not interested at all in their experiences I can give a [ __ ] okay what I'm 
interested is how the hell do you live your life with this how can anybody in their how 
can they go grocery shopping and not look around like the world is asleep holy crap 
guys do you know there's a reality here that is total in conflict with what you think is reality okay that's where my mind was okay all right okay so I started to read a little bit 
and what I realized was even though some of these accounts uh were interesting and frightening and 
um but they lacked they lacked any kind of heart for me I I needed some sort of human contact 
to make it real to me I had to have somebody stare me in the eye and tell me so I started 
at that point to try to find people who had had experiences and I wanted to talk to them 
and that led me to interviewing a few people I mean interviewing is what I do for a living so 
I would interview it and I would offer them a tape of it I said listen you can have this you know and then after hearing a few of those that kind of gave me a little bit of courage and I started to 
talk about myself and share that with them and ask them for their input and then that led me 
to something that I know to you too seems because of who you are it seems completely obvious to me 
it was not I could remember detail for detail everything that happened except how in the world 
did I get switched around with that character how is my back in the hallway what happened 
we didn't dance we didn't hug I was you know swinging at him how the hell did that happen
foreign so in those groups of people that I started to talk to somebody said listen you should 
there's a way to do this and there are people who specialize in these regressions that can be 
very good and and whatever and I have to tell you once again I'm just being honest with you I lied 
my entire life so I tell the truth all the time now I thought it was [ __ ] I said come on you're 
gonna hypnotize me you can't you can't get in here there's no freaking way and then they introduced 
me to a woman and maybe you guys know her I don't I didn't know her her name is Debs Shakti 
um she has a global practice and she works with a lot of um abductees or people who say they're 
contactees or this sort of thing and she's been around for decades and she does Quantum hypnosis 
now once again all of this completely upon my head I don't know anything about that I don't 
know and I'm thinking it's all crap and then I'd meet her now remember I'm about six three 
this woman is like an elf she's a tiny little diminutive thing and I am not a misogynist in 
any way shape or form I grew up with five women which means I can cook clean and so better than 
anybody but but some of the smartest ladies I know in my life it wasn't that it was just that 
I for some reason my mind said there's no way this little tiny person is going to be able to help me 
with something that's so big that I can't even address I can't wrap my arms around 
and she looked at me with this little impish smile and she said we'll see and then she said 
to me she said look John the truth of the matter is I'm not going to do anything to you she goes 
I'm going to teach you how to relax you have spent your entire life building this emotional 
blister around you this is how you've ostracized people keep them in arms length so they won't get 
too close to you so they won't ask you important questions this is you you this is all you and so 
only you can get to this and when you finally relax enough you're going to walk down that hallway that you built and you're gonna unlock that door that you locked and then you're gonna 
walk in and open up that filing cabinet and just all you're going to do is Observe and Report
so we'd have a couple of practice sessions where you know take you back to your you know your most beautiful memory about Christmas or whatever you know and and I was completely amazed 
how Vivid the colors were and I I could recall what my sisters were wearing that morning and my mom said to me and and I it really built it really built a a big confidence that this modality worked 
and so finally I was thinking we were we were ready to do a session and I had an idea this is 
the first moment that I had an idea or film and what it was is that I had been suffering so much
and it was crippling that I realized that there must be other people out there who had never said a word much to your 
point at the very beginning president that it this is almost like a universal sort of thing a lot of people yeah they had never said a word that they had lived with certain fears 
or phobias their entire life that they would never ever breathe breathe a question falcus 
and I thought look if I can ask these questions and I can be there Scaramouche I can be their fool 
I can look like an ass I'll ask these questions I'll find out these answers and maybe 
maybe they can sit in the safety of their living room safety of their sofa and be able 
to turn it off you know just like your friend Preston you said had to take it in bite sizes 
I said maybe that'll help somebody else because I'm starting to get confidence that I was going to find some peace and this is so desperate so desperate to find that peace 
so dabs didn't want to do it okay she didn't want to do it she said look kid this is not a 
carnival we're not playing some damn game here I I you know this is we're dealing with your 
psyche your soul you're you know conscious we you know this is dangerous territory we 
could screw this up and I want to be very very careful especially because you have so much trauma that you bend up all these years but then I described to her when I what I 
intended and you know if you don't know Debs let me just say this you've probably heard this term 
of Christ consciousness you know she's one of these people to give shirt off or back for you she 
she's very service to others person she only cares about the health of and Welfare and other people 
she's just a loving loving person you know one of those people that you automatically want to hug 
um and so I appealed to her on that level and she said okay but then then she was very very strict I 
mean nobody else could be there and everything else so thank God you know I I work for a big 
company you know it's not two guys named Larry and a van you know we have all the toys so we 
had to set up all these remote cameras nobody could be in the building I had to daisy chain all these batteries and everything else and the sessions will go over six and a half hours
and uh and at the end of that session I I knew that that was an Ultraman 
and I knew that I had been taken many times and I knew that I'd not been taken on any ship 
at all and I knew a lot of thing I knew what those colors were 
and I knew and it was uh I had to have somebody drive me home I was so wiped out 
um and I couldn't look at that footage I could look at it for weeks and then I could look at a little bit by little bit by little bit a little bit and then finally look at it um
seriously I I was I I was taken Underground it was a vast a vast Cavern and uh the way the the 
immensity was like this I'm sure that both of you have been into a stadium at some point in your life if I walked you out to the middle of a stadium at you know at midnight dark no lights 
and just left you there and there was not a soul in there that's the kind of immensity that I'm talking it's gigantic and I could tell that it was underground I could smell and feel the moisture in 
the air and at the very apex of the the top part of this uh Dome or whatever there was there was 
an opening but it was a regular and I could see like stalagmites stalactites and there was there 
was a light outside but it wasn't directly above it was you know kind of off it's one side and um 
so I I hope I answered your question I apologize I got lost there you did thank you Christmas um so
at the end of that I I then felt compelled to really assemble this film 
with the entire idea of asking questions that contactees or abductees ask 
you know for example we address screen memories we address why me we address missions we address 
why am I afraid of the dark or why do I have these uncontrollable fears and uh even though I I am in 
the film this is It's a quest I'm searching and and the film differs from other documentaries 
and I'm sure that both of you have seen a thousand of them but and I had to be tread I have to tread 
carefully here because I as I said I'm not a smart guy so I'm going to use the wrong words but but hear me out here I'm speaking to you from the heart most of the people who make documentaries 
about UFOs or aliens or something like this they're usually really smart investigators and for 
the most part they're not experiencers or maybe they became experiences after they became involved in the thing but they're not filmmakers right so what they do is they create these narratives like 
a third party so you kind of see a clip and you hear Walter Winchell in the background you know back in 1940s that sort of thing so it's so when you leave when you leave your brain is 
filled with information maybe you never knew and so you're you're educated but you're not healed
I am a filmmaker I make TV shows and films and commercials so what I did was 
my film is immersive from the very first frame the viewers are inside the experience 
they're like you know in my pocket or on my shoulder and they experience this tremendous fear this trauma and we start off you know one of my critics well several my critics a lot of 
people they kind of poo poo it because they think of it's like remedial and what I try 
to share with them is this I said look you know as evolved as your thinking is 
I'm addressing the world and the World At Large at Large is ignorant and I don't mean that in 
a derogatory sense I mean that is an unknowing right so when you're ignorant that breeds fear 
right yes so I start the world off where the world is and I respect them for where they were 
because that's where I was and then we Shepherd them through that fear accepting it as real but 
showing the Counterpoint and understanding it and as we get to the other side there's more and more 
confidence and more and more peace to it and it leads to some semblance of understanding
in understanding uh is it a positive understanding or just a negative okay no it's 
not it's not neutral and it's not negative it is a positive understanding I start the film in fear 
and I end it with hope and um what is that well let me say this way let me answer your question 
this way my film is called alien abduction answers right and I take a lot of Guff for that oh I'm the 
answer man no no no I'm looking for the answers that's the point and so what happens is that I 
have understood realized that your experience is different than my experience is different 
some experiences are very of this very very similar some of them were very very different and that's there's a lot of variables there and I've come to some uh and part of that is 
I address that in the film as well about trying to have all the answers claiming you know I kind of laugh a little bit about the younger people who say my truth I'm old enough 
to realize you know well okay that's an opinion that no one else shares that's why it's yours um so but but what I try to which I I have a real empathy now for folks because what 
they're doing is they're grappling with things that they may not understand or they understand this much of it and they're trying to translate it into words and then they try 
to very clunkily you know express it to other people and so there's lost in the translations
has it occurred to you that um what you're doing and I respect it totally respect it okay uh have 
you figured yet that the journey the journey that you took and the journey that everybody 
took that you've interviewed and put into your movie every one of your Journeys is extremely 
personal and then it takes each and every one of you on your own to walk through it and that 
I see you Gathering them to help each other walk through it is that what you were trying to do 
I didn't know that that's what I was doing because this really is a true Journey because 
you know some documentaries they kind of had a presupposition at the end I didn't I 
was like I have no freaking nugget deal where this is going to take me but I need to know and but that's exactly the way way it ended or not ended but but completed that Vision 
that that idea was that everybody was here to help each other that in fact it has to be uh 
um uh not emerging but in a simulation of all of this information because the truth is within 
there completely so it is very necessary for Dolly to speak that it's very necessary for 
Preston to speak it's very not because we have to I if you don't mind I'll just share this with 
you my my mind goes to a silly little example I've used before the premise is that we take 
the three smartest people in the world right so we already know the three smartest people we throw them in the dark room we say hey what's in there somebody says it's a spear it's a whip 
it's a boulder what are you talking about you turn on the light it's an elephant right okay so here 
as a filmmaker I press in for nuances so let's press in we've already determined that they're 
the smartest people in the world so they're not giving you errant calm comments they're really giving you their perfect assertation of the facts that they have the second thing is 
this they're wrapping their arms around as much as of the phenomena as they can okay so they're 
doing everything within their power to do that number three they're trying to translate these 
images into something they understand because remember they're bereft of some of their senses it's dark and we as humans we are bereft of some of these filters that truly truly process this 
information and then they're trying to translate it that into an imperfect medium language and 
then they spotted out to us outside in the hallway and now we have to re-translate it into something 
for the most the moral to that story is to your point dolly we need that person who said it was 
a spear and a whip and a boulder to kind of assemble this truth together this is why it is 
so important for us to come together in unity to try to to really come to grips with this because 
what we're dealing with even the stuff that we do understand is a piece of this and we need to 
understand much much more he asked you another question yes have you determined on your own 
uh if there is a way to you you and each one of us everybody have an ability to wake up your mind 
so that you can initiate a community a communion or a comment a conversation
what you came in contact with yeah I think that's a brilliant question 
um I'm sorry to use the elephant example again but I have I have learned I have learned even though I 
like to eat as you can tell uh even though I like to eat you can't eat the elephant in one bite so 
my first film my first film about this is alien abduction answers and what it is is to laying out 
these landmarks that people can find and say ask these questions maybe sometimes in fear 
you're so Frozen that's what I was so Frozen that you're like a deer in the headlights so you can't 
move either way like to your point you said in that crisis you you there's no logic to anything 
you're just falling you're falling you're falling so I'm trying to help people there so the first 
film takes people from ignorance to some sense of understanding second film which I'm working 
on right now is called alien abduction Awakening so the idea is is that after you have some kind 
of semblance some kind of idea of what's going on well now you can make decisions you're no longer afraid a silly example would be like this you walk into a dark room and you see 
a figure in the corner you turn on the light ah it's your jacket on the on the chair okay 
well now you don't have to be afraid you can make decisions and look and all decisions are 
fair you can say hey I am never going to that damn room again that's a decision you can say 
hey I'm going to hang up that jacket so this never happens to me again that's a decision 
you can say Hey listen that jacket doesn't even belong here I'm going to put it in my winter you can make decisions you can participate and as soon as you learn that you can participate 
you take more and more of it it becomes more and more okay and then you realize oh well there's a 
derivative to this and there's a question I can ask about this and now I no longer have to be afraid one of my summary statements in the film they're a couple but one of them is this but I 
can look at this now Through The Eyes of a man no longer a boy and I do not have to be afraid but 
I must deal with this because it is the truth and so now I have to participate it 
participate with it some way somehow you know long answer I apologize I'm Irish if I had if 
I had whiskey if I had whiskey we'd be here can I add something into what you just said 
you shining the light okay that is a very good analogy allegory to what you're talking about 
um one of the things that I was very blessed to have in my life was guidance that you didn't have 
and I had open communication with My Father which he didn't have one of the things that he said to 
me and I would like to pass it to you right now please is that uh to know all that is knowable 
and then proceed it's the greatest gift you give to yourself because as you shine the light 
on everything as you look with the light your perspective changes what you understand changes 
and you start to wear what you call wisdom in your psyche and your ability and how you feel about 
things and that's how we learn period okay and there's no bully in this you're the only person 
marking your Trail you okay and so I just wanted you to know that that what you're doing actually 
is trying to know all that is knowable and you're proceeding and I I think that's fantastic I I'm 
glad to see you doing it because I've met many people and uh since I started coming out and 
talking to people that don't do that they live in absolute abject unbelievable fear and it it 
it it is it is heartbreaking literally and I'm proud of you actually because you're doing a good 
job you really are thank you can I ask you John what what do you feel you have gained from this 
experience is this something that you wish didn't happen to you or how has it affected you have you you know gained anything from all of these experiences um not your first rodeo huh Preston
um well first of all first of all I uh I can walk outside now it's a huge thing a 
huge thing I know it sounds stupid but for me it was hard um also uh a couple of things
I realized I'm not alone which is a huge huge thing
um I realized that this is a this is a communication 
more than anything there is and the reason that we have these 
slips between the communication misunderstandings is is there's a myriad of reasons but but two 
of them is first of all our fear because that clouds everything because it's so I mean I hate to use this term but so alien to us um but the second thing is that it you know I so many times 
you think about Earth okay it's our planet we're humans right there are cultures on our planet that 
we have a difficult time understanding there are certain cultures that if you belch very loudly after a meal it's considered a compliment to me it would be reprehensible how could 
you possibly do that there I would be considered rude which doesn't make any sense to me at all it's a non-sequitur so I've understood now that I need to reserve my judgment and really masticate 
over these things because it just could be me I could just be misunderstanding things 
um also I've realized that there are there is a a reason for these contacts a reason for this 
um communication and and I truly believe I truly believe and in my film you'll see that I have um
because I'm a filmmaker I tell things in stories I apologize but one of the things I do is I say this I said look you know when people talk about answers 
it's our ego the kind of wants to say I own this idea right own this answer 
and and so we really can't do that we have to be much more open-minded about it and the example I 
give is this Elon Musk everybody knows who the guy is he wants to go to Mars so this little story is that he gets to Mars and up the door goes and out of the port somebody from Kenya 
somebody from Asia somebody who's on the volleyball team from Norway right and they 
all come out and there's a Martian and the Martian guy comes out and he says okay who's the Earthling 
everybody looks different everybody's a different size they all were different because of their evolution and their origin on the planet and they might also have different motivations maybe one is 
just exploration maybe one is uh sightseeing maybe one is Conquest who knows I mean but right now 
watch this but the moral to the story is that's one ship from one planet if we accept that life 
is prolific throughout the Universe there's no way that any one person can have all that 
information I'm not saying that they don't own the relationship or the association that they've had 
with the people that have contacted them of course because I can't I wasn't there I didn't share that 
this is why you have to be very very careful with the filter and the discernment in your mind when you're listening when you guys see the film you're going to see some of the folks that I interviewed 
they had a little similarity but most of them are very very different extremely different 
and I had to scratch my head a couple times like wow what does this mean it's only through 
this process that I have and by the way to your point Preston I have gained this sort of empathy 
this sort of understanding that this is a huge huge picture and the thing I think you know what 
I I think I think honestly that my conclusion is is that the original sin of humans 
is really our ego that think about this everybody who denies the phenomena whatever the reason is 
is because of their ego because they in fact know better and you guys are all wearing tinfoil hats 
and you're idiots and I'm the smartest guy in the room then think about this the people who locked on to that experience and then they only had the one answer why because they're the only 
person come on this is a universal thing it's brushing up so there's more what's in the pot 
what's in the way the ego and then take a look at this oh my goodness and this is the thing that breaks my damn heart more than anything you have people who have these incredible experiences 
and it changes their life and then they allow their ego to get in the way and they start 
these things where only they have the answer and people have to adhere to them and you know and 
they start a cult or something oh my God it just breaks my heart because it's like they took two steps forward and eight steps back and then they hurt other people by that and that's why I say 
listen man this film is not about me it's not about me at all it's not even about the bright shiny lights in the sky it's about you and you and you and you and you and us because let me say this 
the bright shiny lights blink out we're the only ones in the left so how does your family 
feel about I mean have you talked to your parents have they had experiences you know 
you know you're that kind of guy who would see a cut and go is that hurt does that hurt is that her
um well a couple things a couple things both my parents are past God bless them uh I suspect 
I never talked to him but I suspect my father had such a visceral environment response that 
he must have had some sort of brush with this thing whatever this whatever you know other 
and that's why he reacted so uh so over the top um I as I said I lied about it or obvious 
skated about it my entire life so you know I do stuff across the country and around the world 
and my family knows that you know I'm in the business right so you know it's like what are you doing I'm just you know doing a shoot or whatever so when we got the film we successfully 
negotiated for it to be distributed by virtual films I knew it was going to be released and then I had a thought that I never thought about how is this going to affect my family 
because they didn't know so I had to have talked about talk and uh well the talk turned 
into several talks as you can imagine and there were a lot of this at the very beginning and then 
um I mean and then it took some dark turns I mean there were there were questions about 
the pressure that I was under and work and things like this or is that abusing drugs or or you know 
anything that would be a more palatable answer than your father has been you know what I mean 
so and then that was very hurtful to me because I'm still recovering I mean I still get teary-eyed 
because you know I always tell people I said look this body is not the result of one Double Whopper 
many many over many years um and so that healing process that coming to terms with it take some 
time and I lied about it for you know almost 50 years so that occurred I was just at a wedding 
not too long ago and there were people that I've known my entire life who walked up right here and talked past me and would not look at me would not would not recognize me as being present 
but I will tell you this on the other side of that coin there are people who have come out of the woodwork that I've known in my life who was on one of these okay John um 
and so you know I I guess I can't answer a direct question I can't say yes or no but that's my 
answer I I get it yeah and I feel like in some ways I see parallels between you and me because 
I found out UFOs were real not too personal experience but from the experiences of my family 
and it was a huge shock and it took me quite a bit to come to grips with it and that's kind of 
why I started writing books because I wanted to understand it certainly and uh I think you know 
having had such a hard time with it and I didn't even actually experience it firsthand I could only imagine how difficult it is for someone who's you know experiencing it you know going there yeah my 
family what some of them weren't happy with me and didn't know what you know like hmm what are you doing yeah this is important you need to know this this is actually happening this is no joke 
agreed agreed and you know what that that might be a good segue to mention Mr Whitley strieber um
I had assembled the film and it was very emotional very very emotional 
and for me it felt right I was just I was just so damned and determined to get it all out there but 
then I realized it was almost like vomiting all this emotion over somebody and they wouldn't be 
able to take it all in it would be overwhelming that they and I also wanted to make sure like you 
Preston I wanted I wanted to make sure the people who were not familiar with the phenomena that they 
could approach it I thought son of a gun this is you know so I had to separate myself from that 
very visceral you know the the effects that it was having on me to you know a proper director proper 
producer and say look this is uneven and I need to I need to make it edible I needed to make it 
watchable and um so I needed a a Counterpoint for lack of a better phrase I'm clunky here 
um like a sage voice and I thought about it and thought about it and remember I told you at the 
very beginning I started to read a little bit and Whitley streeper's voice you know came up 
um just because he's been around for so long and he was so prolific and so I um I didn't know him of course I don't know anybody in the community so what I did was 
I asked a friend of a friend and then Debs knew somebody that shocked he knew somebody and we eventually got to and I'll tell you I'll tell you a funny story since you know him okay 
the first time I ever spoke to Whitley strieber was on the phone uh I'm sorry it was a zoom and he 
was very tough on me now remember I've dealt with some of the biggest stars in the world you know I'm talking about popular Stars Denzel Washington you know Christian Pine you know whatever 
um Timothy Oliphant Etc Rosario Dawson and usually I'm very very nice I'm an affable 
guy okay very very nice to me but he was tough and I thought wow you know I'm kind of surprised 
I had no idea that what he was doing is he was vetting me right because I I 
the film was released in May and I have met some very interesting individuals 
um and God bless them all because I don't know what they're dealing with all of them God bless them all but I've met some very interesting individuals who would not be completely
filled with Integrity let's just say that let's just say that because of the you know background or whatever and I think what he was doing was making damn sure that I was 
not some jerk you know or some guy working out of his van or I just wanted to steal his time 
and so he vetted me pretty harsh and I I have to tell you I was such a it was such a a sensitive 
position of such a damaged kid that I took it personally I thought this guy hates me yeah so 
but but no but I told you this is a funny story so I'm going to get to the funny part right now all right so here's the deal so um I said to him I said Mr Schreiber let me send you the questions 
up front that I would ask you and if you know take a red marker don't like anything you cross it out 
if it's inappropriate whatever so what I did was I said about I told you I was a bibliophile off of off air so what I did was I purchased every single book he's ever produced every single one all the 
fiction all the philosophy all of the all of the uh abduction content everything and I read every 
single every single word and I put together about 63 65 questions and I mean detailed questions 
uh very very deep and I sent it to him he called me and he said listen I 
nobody has ever really asked me some of these nuanced things I uh okay okay I agree to this 
interview and um I was very pleased that he didn't Redline a single one so I went 
out to California and I thought listen it would probably be a good idea if maybe we broke some bread the night before so we'd get a little bit of a rapport because I don't know this man right 
and I really wanted him to not be thinking I don't like this big egg-headed kid instead of 
oh this is John I had lunch with him yesterday or I had dinner with him yesterday so we did and uh 
that's the part that gets really funny he said he was very sarcastic he was very funny and he 
made fun of me the entire time I belly laughed the entire evening I had no it was Charming he 
was quick he was witty I learned a few new words from him his lexicon is much larger than mine so 
it was a blessed evening right so now I'll tell you something that's very heartwarming about him 
so the very next day you know I have a big team lots of likes making people the whole bit 
and he's commenting wow this is you know big production yeah and so we get ready to shoot 
and Eileen there's actually a picture of me on set leaning down talking to him and I say 
um Mr Schreiber I just want to tell you something sir I'm very grateful that you're here I'm not going to waste your time sir and 
um I'm gonna make you look perfect the lights are right the sound is right this is all and I'm in 
the middle of my little diatribe it grabs my arm grabs my forearm he looks at me he says John I 
I don't give a damn how I look I really don't care at all I just want to tell the truth
and I it really gave me pause I thought man what what a man filled with Integrity when 
I grow up I want to be you sir and it's it's funny to me I mean ironic you know I 
um I have pretty much regular contact with Mr strieber you know like every four six weeks or something you know just let them know okay sir the film is here this is what's going on here we've 
won this award here this sort of thing and I can't call him Whitley I would never say that we're 
friends he and I are friends but we're very very friendly of course but I can't call him Whitley I 
call him Mr streber all the time and he makes fun of me he teases the hell out of me and I have to 
say he takes great joy in that so I love it yeah I I actually adore the man this has been great I 
mean we could talk I have one last thing to ask you okay this is a big one yes yes before we go 
um I want to know in the end as you surveil everything that you've done and everything you've thought and gone through what is it that you want from ETS what do you want what do I want
I have to say that my premise for the film was that my need to know outgrew by fear 
okay I I have to say that I am still on a quest for the answers my my last statement in the film 
was this I say listen what is it about these bright shiny lights in the sky that make me want to be a better person I don't understand this perspective change there's more I need to 
understand there's more I need to learn how do I fit into this puzzle how do I help us achieve the 
next level where do we go from here what what are the next things I mean this can't just be 
communication because you're my neighbor hey nice yard you know that's not what it is there's much 
more to this there's a reason that we're on this path and I want to I'm desperate to know 
those things but no longer under the mantle of fear but one of just honest honest Inquisition 
I I want to know I want to know I will tell you something I've been looking for you um
do I owe you money you're an array of Hope in my life okay because I've run 
up against so many people whose rhetoric and belief systems are and their egos are 
right in front of them and they don't see the forks for the trees at all and I have been searching and searching for and searching for somebody who made sense 
of all of it and you do it sir and thank you I appreciate you a lot I didn't know what to 
expect I didn't even John I didn't know who you were until today I'm a nobody no no no no
no no elbowing me do this do this do this and I'm grateful to you very grateful thank 
you okay I really appreciate it thank you thank you thank you thank you you know what Preston's 
gonna be doing yeah I want to send you doll this book actually or the book oh okay I I would love 
that I would love that I think you might enjoy it because she doesn't have a lot of information that you know having interviewed so many people like you who've had these experiences dollies 
connected a lot of the dots for me so I think you might enjoy it wonderful but yeah I really enjoyed 
speaking with you John it was true blessing to me my friend thank you I appreciate you so we're 
so excited about the success of your film so if you have anything else you want to add you know you mentioned you're doing another film or yes uh sure sure you want Awards too that's awesome 
yeah one a best documentary at uh UFO Expo and then the film was shown at UFO con and 
um got a huge response and I I've been contacted by so many people and I'll tell you this is this 
is the thing this is the highest praise uh uh for the film not for me but for the film is it just 
people say listen I couldn't talk to anybody about this it just hurt me so bad whenever I didn't know 
what to do with I didn't know where to put it I watched this film and it really helped me it 
changed and I just thought God isn't that like God's work you know really it just is because 
this is not this is not some sort of contact for you know John Yost nobody gives a crap about me 
this is a content for us because we as a people have to make a decision we have to make a decision 
not to keep looking back but to look forward and we have to look forward together this is the point 
absolutely so um yeah so I I yeah I'm very very blessed the film is called alien abduction answers 
it's on Amazon Prime and Apple TV and Kino and Google Plus and blah blah blah everywhere uh it 
was released May in North America this April uh 15th actually it'll be available internationally 
so I'm very happy about that I am um I just look I can tell you I I suffer from being 
truthful enough I spent a 500 500 000 making this last film so when you see it you'll see 
a film it's not you know two cameras and like this is a movie you'll see it it's immersive 
um and I'm raising money for my next film and I don't know I'm hoping hello I'm I'm hoping 
that uh the material will allow me to do that for the next one because I think it's really 
important because I have an idea for a third one too which would be alien the second one will be alien abduction Awakening um which is taking this information and saying oh my God you know 
and now I'm part of it because I just I say as an aside I know I'm going long press I apologize but 
but I thought when I closed the book on this film right I felt a sense of completion like you know 
I dealt with something that happened a long time ago and that's okay and now I can just 
go back to doing sports or whatever the heck that's incorrect um the door has been cracked 
and different things are happening there's a lot of stuff that's happening to me and but now I'm 
not afraid I'm cautious I have to be honest with I'm cautious but I am now able to go okay now what 
does this mean how does what is this communicating to me what am I supposed to be thinking about this and putting into place that's where people are in the very next stage of this thing and then 
the finals know my not the final but like the kind of conclusion to this the sentences alien 
abduction Ascension and the idea for that is not woo-woo in that sense it's this all of my films 
are about us people us okay so we all share common themes in our lives I don't care what religion you 
are I don't care where you live I don't care your culture or if you like spicy food or not okay we all crawled on our bellies we all finally got up and held onto a sofa we 
all toddled we all walked and fell and bumped our heads we were all children 
this is where we are now as a race what kind of these children and we have to understand that it's 
about time we grew up an adolescent adolescence sucks it sucks for me it sucks for you guys so 
this is what my work is about it's about us so that's the deal I'm sorry that's too long again 
oh that was that was wonderful a true pleasure yeah thanks John that was awesome I'm glad we did 
glad we had this conversation thank you for your work thank you for both of you God bless you both and anyone anyone have anything else they want to add Now's the Time all right okay well thanks guys 
that was really wonderful thanks for watching UFOs in the Paranormal this is John Yost his 
film is alien abduction answers check it out it's award-winning it's quite well received 
and this has been Dolly saffron who's the subject of my book symmetry who you probably already know and that's it for now as I like to always say keep searching for the truth 
keep asking questions and most important keep having fun bye now.
