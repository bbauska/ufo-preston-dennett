AMAZING ALIEN ENCOUNTERS: TEN TRUE CASES
Dec 15, 2023

Summary:
Dec 15, 2023
It’s one of the most mindboggling experiences a person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial. And yet thousands (if not millions) of people have had this experience. And yet, it is still not fully accepted by mainstream society. Thankfully times are changing as governments across the world begin to acknowledge the ET presence. And yet, they are still discussing only UFO sightings and ignoring the cases of direct contact. This video presents ten amazing cases of landings and humanoid encounters of all kinds. Cases from across the planet, spanning many decades, involving multiple witnesses and a variety of evidence.

A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. One day in Aug 1944, Mrs. E.M. Church had a day off from her nursing duties at Cashmere Sanatorium in Christchurch, New Zealand. She was hiking in the area when she came upon a landed craft and three odd-looking humanoids. She hoped to speak with them and get a ride! But as she approached, they fled into their craft. The aftereffects were as amazing as the encounter itself.

UFO LANDING WITH HUMANOIDS. On Mar 18, 1950, Wilfredo H. Arevalo was driving near his ranch at Lago Argentino, Argentina, when a craft with a transparent dome landed nearby. Inside, he saw four pale-skinned humans wearing cellophane-like jumpsuits. They shot a beam of light at him, and then took off. The next day, Wilfredo found burned grass where the craft had landed. Also, many people in the area also reported seeing the craft.

THEY WALKED OFF INTO SPACE. On Oct 8, 1968, four people in Asbestos, Canada were puzzled by a greenish glow in the sky. Suddenly a flying saucer emerged from the glow and began to move off. Two of the witnesses followed it as it moved away. But two of the witnesses stayed at their house and were amazed to see humanoid figures exit the craft and walk into empty space.

THE ALIEN IN THE ORCHARD. It was lunchtime in Aug of 1973 for farmhand Edmond Cardoso de Oliveira at a farm in Nova Friburgo, Brazil. To his amazement, he saw a silver, egg-shaped craft landed in the orchard. He walked up to the craft and suddenly a door opened. He found himself face-to-face with a 3-foot-tall humanoid. Edmond fled. He returned with more witnesses, but the craft was gone.

THE THREE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOID. On Oct 19, 1973, a family of three was shocked to see a glowing red UFO hover over their farm in Copeland, NC. The wife screamed and pointed to the ground. Standing before them was a 3-foot-tall humanoid in a golden metallic suit. They fled in their car and refused to return until the next day. They left their dog, but he also ran away and didn’t return until the next day.

ETS FROM A PHONE-BOOTH-SHAPED UFO. On Oct 29, 1976, six boys were playing near a local cemetery in Barakaldo, Spain when they saw a strange object descend into a walled-in field. Two of them ran to investigate and saw the craft on the ground. Out stepped two tall figures. One walked up to the wall, knocked on it, and then pulled out a laser-like device and shot at it. The boys fled in fear.

ETS LIKE TOY SOLDIERS. Around 3:00 am on Dec 31, 1976, Nellie Richardson was awakened in her home in Bignall, England by a loud bang. Looking outside, she saw a huge oval-shaped object hovering in the fields outside her window. It stayed for nearly 40 minutes. As it began to move away, she saw little humanoids inside, moving back and forth. Her son came home just in time to watch the object move off.

ETS VISIT TRANSMITTER STATION. On Oct 18, 1977, Kurt Nilsson was testing out his ham radio by the transmitter station on Hemliden Mountain, Sweden. It strangely malfunctioned, and that’s when he saw a landed UFO and three very short humanoids. He tried to flee, but they aimed a strange device at him and stalled his car. Afterward, more strange events occurred.

THE BABYSITTER & THE ALIEN. In Feb 1981, a 17-year-old girl babysat at her neighbor’s house in Greensburg, PA when a UFO hovered outside. It was close enough that inside, she could see two humanoids with large bald heads and weird eyes operating a strange console. She felt entranced by them, but finally fled inside, when the electronics of the house began to fail.

RUSSIAN ROBOTIC ETS. Around 2:30 pm on Jul 6, 1989, a group of six children watched in shock as a spherical UFO landed near their homes in Kharovsk, Russia. The craft separated and out stepped a tall, robotic-like figure, which walked across the field. Then another UFO landed and another ET came out. This happened a third time! Then a fourth UFO landed. The strangeness had only begun.

These ten cases provide a tantalizing and intriguing glimpse into the subject of extraterrestrial visitation. They represent only the tip of the iceberg of the countless of other encounters that have happened across the planet. There are too many cases to ignore. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not alone!

hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today's episode
is called amazing alien encounters 10 true cases I just love the cases
involving humanoids I find them endlessly fascinating and every single
one of the cases that I will be presenting today involve humanoids actually humanoids of all
different kinds short little beings Grays human looking ET s robotic ETS and
more so these cases do come from all over the world I love finding cases that
cover our entire planet so I have cases from Russia from Sweden England Spain
one from Canada a couple from South America Argentina and Brazil and of course a couple of us cases as well one
from New Zealand so quite a wide geograph graphical area and of course
stretching all the way back to the 1940s up through the 1980s each of these cases does have
evidence of some form or another whether it's simply eyewitness testimony but a
good number of them have the whole range of evidence that we often see which of
course is landing traces electromagnetic effects physiological or medical effects
animal reactions some really interesting cases involving psychic effects as
well as I've said many times each case provides another piece of the puzzle
answering some of the many questions surrounding ET contact and the ET agenda
on our planet so each case does have some something to offer to sort of
further our understanding of what's going on here so yeah 10 cases
and each is unique in its own way so let's just get started and the first
case I'd like to talk about today I love because it's a very early case involving
a quite unusual humanoid a really unusual UFO and also some very
interesting psychic effects and I call this one a piece that passes all
understanding this one took place in New Zealand actually in Christ Church New
Zealand way back in August of 1944 the primary witness in this case is
a sister and a nurse by the name of eem church and she worked at the time of her
encounter at the very well-known cashmir sanatorium and it was one afternoon in
August of 1944 that she had the day off and decided that she would take a walk among
the gentle Hills behind the sanatorium as you can see here now when she saw
some low clouds moving in she feared that she might get lost so she decided
to cut her hike short and turn around and as she's walking back to the cashmir
sanatorium this is when she came upon a quote upturned saucer where she said sat
on a small hill quote very close to the road she said it was hidden from sight
from the road by a small rise but she saw it and thinking it was some sort of
advanced aircraft now mind you this was during World War II she walked right up
to it she actually thought it might be a gimmick from the industries Fair which
was being held at that time at nearby Christ Church and she thought to herself
what will they invent next so she said she walked up to to this thing and stood
quite quite close to it she felt no effect from it but as she's watching it
she said she was absolutely astonished to see three 4ft tall figures
who she called quote little fellas they were standing inside these
transparent rectangular glass-like cases again three of them one was looking out
a window of The Craft one was standing in a doorway of The Craft and the third
was standing outside right next to the craft so at this point she's still
thinking this might be something mundane conventional and she's wondering could
they be Japanese two of them wore helmets but the one outside did not and she said
that they had quite big heads composing nearly half their body height they
appeared to be greenish in color and she couldn't didn't see any visible arms or
legs and as miss church says in her own words the occupant of the object
appeared to be absorbed in watching the fair and City generally the one outside
was just a green colored entity in a transparent boxlike casing just standing
there so she did provide drawings as you can see of these figures but the craft
itself was also very strange she said it was about 20 ft across 9 ft tall with
quote kind of a plain ordinary aluminum turret on top and above that she said
there was a 3ot high masslike cylindrical projection much in the shape of a pipe
but it had a mushroom shaped cap on top and she could see a pale blue light
shining from the very top of this masted like projection the base of the object itself
was flat she said it was brown in color and looked quite strange as though it
was composed of tiles almost like a wood veneer she said and again the center of the object
did have a door and to the right was a window and this is where she was seeing
these three figures so she's looking at this trying to figure it out but the clouds were
moving in fast so miss church decided she was going to take a closer look she
said she actually wanted to quote talk to the people even get a ride I wasn't
afraid I didn't have any sense of fear at all so she just walks right up to it
and she says approached to about 18 ft of the occupant and 25 ft from the ship
so very very close and she was actually walking closer when her footsteps made a
noise she stepped on a stick or some leaves or something and this caused the occupant to notice her and the one who
was outside looked directly at her at that instant his helmet flipped over his
head automatically and he quote drifted still inside his enclosure back into the
craft and it was weird cuz he wasn't walking she said he moved in quote a kind of sliding movement into the space
thing he slid straight into the very small opening so she only got a brief look at
these UFO occupants and as she watched the door slid closed like a sliding door
she felt as though she had interrupted them and that if she hadn't come upon them they would have stayed longer but
unfortunately she did interrupt them and the object then made a worrying noise
the blue light on the the craft brightened and the craft itself Rose vertically it took a couple of minutes
to rise upwards into the clouds and then it was gone and she had a very
interesting reaction once it left as she says when the thing took off I wish I
could have gone with it I felt a sense of loss as it disappeared and it gets even more
interesting while she felt no immediate after effects from the encounter other than the one of having encountered this
as she lay down to sleep that evening she did feel something very strange she
said it was quote just as though a presence came into the room you know in
the Bible it tells you of the peace that passes all understanding that was the
kind of peace that seemed to come as though there was a presence in the room but you couldn't see it it was unusual
it seemed to stay with me for the whole whole week and what's amazing about this
is while this affected her profoundly it started to affect the people around around her as well as miss church says
in her own words all the patients I went to responded to me it was just as though
I had an external Spirit guiding me I don't know why a woman said to me I get
a Wonder feeling when I stand beside you I was aware that there was something something about me I don't know what it
was so this is an amazing after effect it somehow caused a sort of Spiritual
Awakening in her which is something we do often see at any rate miss church
became thoroughly convinced that she did see something very unusual Beyond a
conventional craft as she says in her own words I don't care if anybody
believes me or not I did see this thing I think they're C from some outer
space and in some corroboration of her experience it was s years later when a
reverend H Brown in the area reported seeing what was apparently the same or
similarly described craft though when he was asked about it by investigators he
denied the sighting and refused to talk about it what an amazing case that is
how it affected the witness spiritually and she's a good WT witness a medical
professional someone with some deep religious convictions not the type of person who would be prone to lying or
making up stories and again a very early case I love how she was very resistant
to call this something from outer space until it became very clear that there
was no other explanation and the fact is she got right up close to this landed craft and
humanoids and that makes this a really interesting case because there's really
little chance of misperception now moving along in time
we go all the way to Lago Argentina this is a very interesting case which I call
a UFO landing with humanoids this took place on March 18
1950 and is one of the earliest reports of humanoids in this area some have
called it the earliest I don't know if that's still true or not but it's quite
an amazing encounter with a landed UFO and human-looking
ETS and of course has some amazing evidence as well this case was originally published in La razon which
is an Argentine newspaper published in Portuguese and was apparently never
officially investigated nevertheless it is an intriguing report at 6:30 p.m. a
Rancher by the name of wifredo H aravo was at his Ranch in Lago Argentino this
is quite a large lake when he observed a metallic disc land near his property and
wifredo describes this experience in his own words so I'll just quote him
directly as Alfredo says I suddenly saw in the clear sky
coming from the southeast at Fantastic speed two luminous points
that describing wide circles were approaching the earth I initially
believed that they were falling stars but suddenly one of those lights took on a dizzying height and remained fixed in
Space the other began to describe pronounced circles at lower and lower
altitudes until it landed softly On The Ground Three keters in front of me in
the pasture field of LA buang quata on the the road to the lake despite the
distance I was able to really realize that it was an extremely white and
phosphorescent circular machine from which bluish smoke emerged from the back
extremely luminous and dense I started my truck approaching
cautiously because I thought that perhaps it was some Jet Plane from our military Aeronautics that had crashed I
stopped my vehicle 150 m away from that silver machine that Shone intensely
among the tall grasses because there extremely impressed I realized that this
was not an airplane but an extremely Curious Thing from which a dense bluish
green Vapor which smelled strongly of burning Benzene the circular machine had a large
rotating plane that constantly rotated like a victrola record it structured
seemed to be made of aluminum or some other very light metal and it was strangely
phosphorescent in its middle part was located a large glass cabin or something
similar in the shape of a dome of dazzling transparency and
Clarity inside moved four extremely tall and slender men dressed in white clothes
fitted close to their bodies those figures had to be at least
2 m tall calculating that the diameter of the cabin was 8 m and that of the
rotating plane 15 M the crew of The Machine seemed to have
their bodies wrapped in something like cellophane covers as their figures Shone
in a very strange way their faces were extremely pale almost Pure White their
other proportions were normal and even graceful they Shone wrapped in those kinds of
cellophan covers and I think they managed to discover me because suddenly they illuminated me in a blinding way
and watched me like that for a long time the intense Luminosity of the
transparent vault in which those tall men moved prevented me from seeing
perfectly the white objects that they used but despite this I thought I
noticed two types of mirrors or camera lenses that rotated and moved
continuously and a number of devices similar to those used by dentists in
which I thought I saw a number of instruments similar to those used on airplane
dashboards despite the Curious nature of the spectacle I was going to try and get
closer to them to verify who they were or if having suffered some mishap they
needed any help at that moment the flat machine spun quickly on its axis and
placing itself in front of me it dazzled me with a very strong bluish light that
seemed to emerge from its front part suddenly the machine began to expel intense blue smoke and a reddish green
flame from its rear part and it Rose as if propelled upwards by a springboard
emitting a soft hum and in seconds it became a luminous
point so so this is all from Alfredo's letter to the lazon newspaper and he
goes on to describe how this craft joined the second craft which was still hovering up in the sky and then both
darted off at this point Alfredo drove off at high speed and returned home to
ponder what he saw and the next day he decided to return to the site with two
of his farm hands they traveled on Horseback and went into this field where the craft had landed and they found
quote broken and charred grasses so he not only sent this letter
to the newspaper he included drawings of The Craft and he said that he would
report his encounter to military officials but he ended his letter by
saying quote I am sure of what I have seen and later it was discovered that
other people in the area saw a similarly described craft in the same area at the
same time that I think you'll agree is a truly spectacular case I like it because
there are additional Witnesses uh some very interesting effects in terms of the landing traces
found also the odor described uh the human looking ETS I think there's a lot
to learn from each of these cases said it before and I'll say it again each
case provides another piece of the puzzle answers so many of the questions surrounding this UFO
phenomenon and moving along to the next case which is quite brief but very
unusual I call it they walked off into space this one took place on October
88th 1968 in a little town called asbestos
Canada yeah you heard me right asbest and I think that might provide an
important clue as to why the ET visit this particular area there's not a lot
known about this case but again it's quite unusual and does have multiple Witnesses and the witnesses provided
drawings Paul his wife and two of his in-laws were watching television in
their home in his bestis the city is now renamed Val Des
Source suddenly Paul's wife looked out the window and she saw a strange
illuminated kind of rectangular-shaped green glow in the in the sky and she
shouted out Paul hurry look so Paul and the others jumped up and looked and
watched as this green glow brightened and suddenly a solid looking
saucer-shaped craft emerged from the glow this saucer had yellow orange
lights around it three lights beneath it Paul and his brother-in-law rushed outside to get a better look they
actually got into their car and drove towards the city of St George in an
attempt to get closer meanwhile this UFO started to move off in another Direction it darted
behind a cloud lighting it up with green illumination the tban followed it again
down the road towards the city of St Cloud now as they approached closer this
dazzling sphere of yellow orange light emerged from the cloud and they parked
their car and got got out and watched it and it was quite apparent in fact residents of a nearby Home came out and
also watched this all of them walked closer to the object which was now close
enough to bathe them in its illumination and it was so close in fact that they
became frightened and decided to flee the scene now unknown to them back at the
house Paul's wife and sister-in-law were in the house watching the UFO the whole
time and they said that they saw very distinctly as two humanoid shapes
emerged from the craft as you can see here and walked seemingly into
space after that the object then moved towards the city of Windsor disappearing
slowly and was lost Among the Stars it's certainly an interesting sighting made
all the more interesting by its location over a town famous for mining asbest so perhaps this was the reason
that it was hovering over the town hard to say yes that is a brief case but it
does involve multiple Witnesses it went on for quite some time and it's really
interesting I do think it's entirely possible that the ETS were visiting this
area because of the asbest mine there are so many cases of et's investigating
mins I'm of course speculating here don't know I feel like there's a lot
that's going on behind the scenes that we just aren't privy to we don't have all the answers which is why research is
so important and moving along this is another very interesting case which I
suspect involves ETS that were drawn to a particular area I call this one the
alien in the orchard this is a single witness case there isn't a whole lot of physical
evidence really at all all to support this case though it was very thoroughly
investigated and it's certainly fascinating this one occurred on in
August of 1973 in Nova Freo and this is in Brazil
it was 2: p.m. on a sunny afternoon again in August of 1973 as 19-year-old Edmund cardoso de
Oliva took a break from working on the orch ured of the farm where he was
employed he sat down and was peeling an orange to eat and this is when he
noticed something strange about 45 ft away from him the leaves of a very
unusual tree which is called the Jabo tiaba tree the leaves were all shaking
though all the other trees around it were standing still it was not a windy day so these leaves should not be
quivering the way they were so puring more closely at this strange sight this
is when he saw quote an eye hurting shining ball like bluish
aluminum he said it was hovering less than 2 feet above the ground was about 6
feet in diameter oval in shape and had a dark green band around the center the
perimeter and he was amazed by how brightly this metallic object was
glowing and he decided to get close Clos ER and he walked right up to it to about
3T away he could now get a much closer look at this spherical object and he
said in fact it had a metal cylinder attached to the top of it which went
straight up and on top of this metal cylinder there was an upside down
cone-shaped device which was rotating counterclockwise the whole object seemed
to wobble unsteadily and fearing it might actually fall on him Edmund turned
around and retreated about 12 feet and as soon as he did so he heard this loud
metallic cracking sound sort of like a door being slammed and turning back
around he saw that in fact a metal door had opened from the bottom half of the
sphere this oval-shaped object the store was quite small about 3T high and 2T
wide he could see it close enough that the wall of the sphere itself was about
2 in thick inside this opening he saw nothing but Darkness at first but after
about 30 seconds he was amazed to see a humanoid being which was taller than the
door just a little bit had to stoop slightly as it stepped out of the craft
he estimates this being was just over 3T tall was dressed dressed in a black
jumpsuit which had a really interesting sort of material to it with all these
little kind of circles all over the material of this
jumpsuit he said the cuffs and the sleeves and the collar were gray as were
the shoes now the being's face was covered but it appeared to have holes
and eyes and a mouth and on its back it had strapped to
it a sort of metallic looking box much like a backpack so Edmund's watching all of
this and the humanoid exits the craft in a very unusual way not by walking
although it was moving its arms and legs vigorously but it appeared to be
floating along on a sort of flexible transmar transparent mat and it made it
appear as though this humanoid was actually floating and to Edmund's amazement this being
quickly approached him to a distance of about 3 feet standing directly in front
of him so now seeing this very strange humanoid right in front of him Edmund
became filled with fear and he turned and and he ran away but as he did so he
did stop and look back about three times he said just to make sure that the ET
wasn't following him and it wasn't but either way he ran quickly towards the
Farmhouse to find his boss he found the boss's wife and another employee and he
returned to the site of the encounter with this other employee unfortunately by this time the
craft and the ET were now gone later the owner of the farm
questioned Edmond in detail and could not Shake him from his story found him
to be very sincere and trustworthy and later there was a full investigation
of the incident by UFO researchers they were not able to find any hard evidence
of the encounter Landing traces or anything like this but neither did they find any evidence of a hoax I wish there
were other witnesses to that case I'm sure the witness himself does as well
but it's still a remarkable case and there are so many cases of ETS visiting
Farms that I suspect that's probably why the ET was there again pure speculation
but perhaps they were there to pick oranges or the weird fruit from this tree that is so unusual and apparently
grows only in Brazil and the surrounding areas very hard to say for sure at any
rate certainly a fascinating case and so is the next one which is also quite
brief but really unusual and I have has I think some interesting takeaways I
call this one the three foot tall humanoid again a very brief case took
place on October 29 1973 in Copeland North
Carolina and it's interesting because this was right smack in the middle of a
huge wave of humanoid sightings sweeping across the United States and for that
matter the world this case from researcher George faucet involves a family of three David
a Doby his wife their son and as it turns out their dog it was around 7:45
p.m. on October 19 1973 and the family was just leaving
their home to attend a football game when they saw a large Blue oval-shaped
object hovering over their mobile home now they did live on a little Farm
plot David's attention was focused solely on this strange craft hovering
above their home when suddenly his wife let out a scream and standing in their
front yard they all saw a 3ft tall humanoid dressed from head to toe in a
sort of golden metallic suit in fact even the face appeared to
be covered so they reacted with extreme fear they quickly piled into their car
and screeched off leaving their home and actually would not return that night
they ended up staying at David's Father's House George Doby they were so
scared they even left their dog behind but the dog also apparently fled because
when the family returned the next day the dog was missing and only returned
later so yes this is a brief case but but it's important because it's part of
this huge wave of humanoids that was occurring in late 1973 it also shows how frightening an
encounter can be and is of course another amazing example of an animal
reaction to the presence of a UFO and in this case a humanoid to me the most
interesting takeaway from that case is how the people the witnesses reacted to
the presence of this humanoid it absolutely terrified them this is so
unfortunate cuz I don't think that the ET was there to hurt them uh but even
the dog ran away for a full day it's a good example of an animal reaction case
so that alone I think makes this case significant and there's so many cases
it's just case after case after case I don't know how people can continue to be skeptical of this phenomenon when there
are so many darn cases cuz here's another one I call this one ETS from a
phone booth shaped UFO and that I think is the most unique and bizarre aspect of
this case is the shape of the craft itself this case took place on October
29 1976 in baracaldo Spain it is a multiple
witness case and it also has some very other unusual elements to it as we shall
see this case comes from researcher Juan Jose Benitez the author of many books um
someone who has investigated a lot of cases it involves six boys who were out
playing next to a wall in field near a cemetery when suddenly they heard a very
loud crackling sound coming from above and looking up they saw the source of
this sound it was a cylindrical object shaped much like a telephone booth
descending into the field so two of the boys had enough courage to run over to
this field to investigate and they saw that this object had actually landed in the field in fact it stood on three
Landing legs and they could see that this object was emitting white and red
lights it appeared to be metallic an oval-shaped opening appeared emitting
this red light from the interior I and then out stepped they said two very tall
humanlike figures that were wearing tight fitting black diving suits with a
wide bright belt now the boys said that they did see two bright shiny eyes on
each of these beings but no other facial features could be
discerned the two figures walked slowly towards one of the walls that was
surrounding this field then it acted in a very unusual way one
of the humanoids began banging on one of the walls he did this several times and
then walked back to the center of this field and one of the figures then pulled
out a long thin instrument from a sack that was strapped to his side and
pointed it at the wall this point a long thin beam of light came out of the
instrument and struck the wall after doing this a few times firing its little
laser at the wall both figures just turned around and walked back into their
craft now at this point the boys realized they were seeing something very unusual and ran back home to tell their
families so they didn't see the object actually depart and as far as I know
there's no other information about this case but it's certainly interesting because I can't help wondering why the
ET were shooting their light beams at the wall testing it I mean who knows but
it's a weird case there you go ETS coming out of their craft whipping out their little laser guns and going Pew PE
pew at the wall who knows what's going on here it's quite strange but certainly
interesting and here's another case which actually got quite a bit of attention generated quite a lot of
controversy as well actually and I call this one each Like Toy Soldiers this took place on
December 31st 1976 in big null England it involves two
witnesses and as we shall see there's some other very interesting elements to
it as well at precisely 2:42 a.m. Nelly
Richardson age 65 says she was awakened from a sound
sleep by a loud banging noise noise investigators did verify this
because the neighbor heard it as well so Nelly immediately noticed that her room
was flooded with a brilliant glow which she could immediately see was coming from a large oval shaped object hovering
Motionless in the sky at low altitude outside her window which overlooked the
cheser plane and off in the distance the city of crew so this object was either quite
large or very close to her window or both cuz she said it filled a good
quarter of her window and she said it was actually larger than the apparent
size of a full moon and she watched it for quite some time until it eventually moved she said
it seemed to move towards her at which point it turned a dark orange color and
after 40 minutes of watching this this thing began to move away and and this is
when she noticed humanoid figures silhouetted inside the object they
looked to her like quote toy soldiers and she said they were moving to and fro back and forth inside this
craft she saw them for only a short while and they disappeared as this
object moved further away so she's still watching it when suddenly her son John
aged 31 came came running into the house he had been working the night shift at a
restaurant and he ran upstairs to tell his mother that there was a large orange
sphere hovering over the Cheshire plain of course she was looking at it and they
both watched it move off into the distance they also both noticed that
their cat who was never to be disturbed at night was acting very unusually she
sat in front of the window staring at this object the whole time it was
there now this case did end up getting quite a bit of attention it was
thoroughly investigated researchers contacted Manchester Airport and the
Cheshire police neither who had any explanation or information one of the researchers
actually appeared on BBC television to discuss the case and this is when the controversy
began because there were some researchers who after looking into this
case wondered if perhaps Nelly and John had seen the moon and mistaken it for an
a UFO because apparently the setting moon was near that location of the sky around
that time however the witnesses denied this they said that they saw it after the
moon had set they said the object had moved that it changed colors that it was
oval-shaped and not round and was actually larger than the full moon and
of course there was the matter of the two humanoid scene not to mention the weird behavior of the cat despite all
these details there are a few researchers to this case who really believe that these Witnesses saw the
moon so what exactly the Richardson saw the moon or something else it remains a
mystery so there you go while some investigators are absolutely convinced those Witnesses saw the setting Moon I
don't know I think it's pretty hard to mistake ETS for a setting Moon and let's
face it the investigators weren't there this is a witness who at age 65 has seen
the moon many many many times uh so I don't know hard to say for sure
misperceptions do happen but I think it's a a valid case and certainly worth
knowing about and of all the cases I'm presenting today this next one I find
the most fascinating it's really a quite complicated case involving almost the
full range of evidence so we have physiological effects we have
electromagnetic disturbances we have Landing traces and
animal reactions multiple Witnesses apparently and it's quite an extensive
case involving a landed UFO and humanoids I call this one et's visit
transmitting station it occurred on October 18
1977 at hemline Sweden this is actually a mountain which holds a transmitting
station and I think this is a very significant detail because this is
perhaps What drew the ETS to it as we shall see this absolutely amazing case
comes from researchers Carl Anon Matson and thorald berelson who you can see
here and it's an important case for many reasons primarily I think because it has
so much evidence and because of where it took place the primary witness is a
gentleman by the name of Kurt Nelson he's a ham radio
Enthusiast he had recently been having trouble reaching a friend on the ham radio in his car and he was hoping to
get better reception so around 6:30 p.m. on October 18
1977 kurk decided he was going to drive up the Hem Len Mountain where this
transmitter station was located so he drove directly up to this
station which is located on hem lien mountain and completely surrounded by
Forest but but strangely after getting up there and parking next to the station
he still couldn't get good reception while he could hear his friend off in
another city his friend couldn't hear him and this didn't make much sense so
finally he kind of gave up and it was around 8:00 p.m. when he was beginning to leave that Kurt saw something very
strange and as Kurt says in his own words my attention was caught by a pale
blue object outlined against a hilic down in a hollow I was casually studying
it when I realized that it was some sort of machine with a dome in front of the
object there appeared three figures dressed in tight fitting
suits so at this point he was about 300 ft away from the craft and the humanoids
which is pretty close he said the craft was quite small about 6 feet wide and it
looked like a classic Flying Saucer it glowed brightly enough that the three
figures in front of it were clearly visible he said they were about 3 feet in height they wore gray suits that had
almost a plastic likee texture to them and white blutes and gloves that
appeared to be attached without seams to the jumpsuits they also wore helmets with
sort of a face plate in front so he's absolutely amazed he can
instantly this is not normal and he flicked on the brights of his car headlights to get a better look at them
but the moment he did so the craft and the humanoids seemed to just blink
out so he was shocked and he remained in his car and waited for about 1 minute
when suddenly the craft and the humanoids reappeared and this caused him quite a
bit of fear and he decided to drive off and he got about about 150 ft down the
road came around the corner and now saw that the three figures he had initially
seen standing in front of the craft were now standing in front of him blocking
the road they were standing in the middle of the road he stopped his car he had no choice and stared in
amazement now his engine was still running and his headlights were on these
three figures stood in a row in front of him and the middle figure was facing him
holding this sort of weird curved shovel like device the other two were in
profile both of them were kind of looking down at the ground or at this device sort of towards the central
figure and at this point the central figure took this shovel likee device
lifted it up with both hands and aimed it directly at Kurt instantly his car engine died and
the headlights went out a a terrible fear swept over him and he actually thought to himself this is the end so in
a panic he tried to restart the car engine and to his immense relief the
engine did start it roared to life he put the car in reverse and quickly
backed up about 30 ft so he waited in fear for about 10
minutes because at this point he couldn't see the ETS it was dark finally
he turned on his headlights and to his great relief these figures were gone nor
could he see the craft though he does admit that where the craft had been it was now behind a hilic a small hill and
would have been not seen from the road so he didn't care at this point he
wanted to get home he rushed home and told his wife Eva what had
happened now as it turned out years earlier back in March of
1969 a gentleman by the name of Kel nazlund worked at the transmitter
station this very station and he had reported seeing humanoids in this exact
same spot in fact his encounter received quite a bit of publicity Kurt knew about
it and he called Kel nazlund up and of
course Kel was amazed to hear Kurt's story and was even more amazed because
he said on that night his TV transmission had been mysteriously
disturbed no more strange events were soon to follow as Kurt says describing
about when he got home he says and I quote when I came into the kitchen our
dog began barking at me I got bewildered because usually he greets me at the door
and jumps on me with a leap of well welcome then he lay down pressed up in
the kitchen corner so somehow this dog recognized
that something very unusual happened and apparently did not even recognize his owner it's very odd Kurt also noticed
that his watch was now 20 minutes slow and two days later Kurt returned to
the site with his wife and dog to see if the ETS and the craft might still be
there of course the they weren't but he did notice something else weird as Kurt
says in his own words the dog reacted in a strange manner when we went up the
mountain he just followed me in the same Footprints usually he runs in front of
me and runs about everywhere so Kurt's encounter did get
quite a bit of attention and it was shortly after it occurred that researcher Reinhold carlby visited the
site and and he found some interesting physical evidence a birch tree where the
object had hovered showed damage on the trunk not at the bottom but sort of up
off the ground a little bit indicating that the craft had not actually landed
which was exactly what uh Kurt had reported he also noticed that there were
two heaps of moss that didn't look like they should be there it appeared as if
the ETS or someone had scraped them off a tree and deposited them at the site so
there's some speculation that the ETS were gathering vegetation also found alongside both
sides of the road where Kurt said he had seen the humanoids were tiny bipedal
Footprints they were short and wide and round with sort of a strange cross on
the heel as you can see here one of the most amazing things about this encounter besides of course
the electromagnetic disturbances the animal reactions and the apparent Landing traces was its location at the
transmitting station and of course the fact that another encounter had occurred
at that exact spot 8 years earlier it was on March 12th 1969 that
Kel nasand who was the director of the transmitting station was at the location
because alarms kept going off and he had gone there to investigate whether there was a possible overload of the
transmitter but as he read the instruments he couldn't find anything wrong but then he received this powerful
he thinks telepathic impulse to go outside and looking outside he saw only
about 45 ft away a large cigar-shaped object about 15 to 20 feet
long it was very low it made a very loud buzzing noise and as he watched an
opening appeared and inside he could see this sort of tube like Corridor and
coming down this Corridor were about 10 very unusual looking
entities this point he was unable to move and the
entities filed into the station kind of shot out of the tube they were hovering
they appeared almost transparent and they were boxlike in shape but he did
have the impression that this was sort of a covering a protective armor that the beings were actually
humanoid and there was another very strange effect Kel said that his vision
changed so that it didn't matter where he looked he could see the whole station all at once so this sounds like some
sort of weird telepathic rapport with these beings and it was very OB obvious
that these beings were very interested in the station because eight or 10 of them just started meing around examining
all the equipment and a few of them actually approached Kel and began to
speak with him and as he says in his own words I can't explain it any other way
than a feeling it was no voice inside my head I could hear their voices clear and
distinct but as if from far away intimate voices reasoning with me about
my flying giving technical advice discussing navigation problems voices
that calmed me and gave me knowledge I never could have found from others gel says he felt no fear but
instead felt as if these beings were his friends long lost friends or something
and they stayed for a good period of time at least 10 minutes he estimates
and then without warning quickly went outside of the station and were sucked
into the craft through this strange tube like Corridor the little opening closed and
this craft immediately took off and was gone the only physical evidence he found
of the encounter was the top of a pine tree was sheared off but it was a good
amount of it 3 in thick and in corroboration of Kel's encounter a local
man did call the newspaper to say that he saw a strange Craft on that same
evening in that area what an amazing case that is to have so much evidence of
different kinds and for the same exact location to be visited twice that's
really really unusual and I think it's pretty clear that the actual draw of the
ETS was the transmitting station we know from so many other accounts that ETS are
drawn to anything that's technological whether it's a dam or an
airport or hydroelectric station or prisons even anything technological air
bases military bases nuclear stations so perhaps that's what they
were doing there investigating this station which certainly seems to be undeniable in the second
encounter so truly an amazing case and now we get to another one which I call
the babysitter and the alien this case took place on February
14 1981 in a dense suburb in Greenberg
Pennsylvania and as the title implies involves someone who was babysitting a
young child and had this incredible encounter with a UFO and humanoid it's a
good case was well investigated and although it is a single witness case and
the person is anonymous it has some important and unique elements to it so
again this is a single witness case involving an anonymous teenager but was
reported the police and was thoroughly investigated and has some very interesting aspects to it 17-year-old
Julie that is a pseudonym she was babysitting a neighbor's son in a
crowded suburb in Greensburg Pennsylvania now she was married and she
knew that her husband would be leaving for work around 1:45 a.m. so at that
time she walked out onto the enclosed front porch of this home and was hoping
to see him but instead she saw something else she saw a dark metallic triangular
object with three lights on each end hovering just a above the nearby
homes and as she watched it apparently noticed her because it tilted down
towards her kind of showing its top side and she could see that it had a bubble
like formation on top and she could see what appeared to be three transparent
Windows one was in front and quite visible but the other two were on either
side of this sort of triangular-shaped object and as she watched this object
emitted a weak white light very much she says like a flashlight beam but it
slowly descended downward um not hitting the ground all at once but slowly and illuminated the
ground below it and looking through the front window of The Craft she could now see two humanoid
figures and boy did they look strange as you can see from her drawing she said
that they had quote very large heads Oriental like eyes Gill like ears and
two holes instead of a nose while she could only see one of these figures from the shoulders up she
saw that the other one had a long thin neck broad shoulders smooth white skin
and normal looking arms one was sitting down but she could
see that the other was standing behind an instrument panel which she could see clearly
uh she drew it she said it was white with two rows of small black knobs side
by side on one side with two gray black circular knobs on the other side and
three sort of slide controls in the center she said the interior of the craft was all lit up though she saw no
actual source of Illumination but she says she felt compelled to stand on the porch and
watch this craft and humanoid which she did for about 15 minutes before finally
she was able to pull herself away and flee to the living room and she sat
there quite nervous afraid and anxious and at this point the TV was emitting a
weird buzzing noise and it went black and also the light in the living room
went out by itself this was the only light that was on so now she was
thoroughly frightened she ran to the phone and called her parents and told them to come pick her up and the young
boy that she was babysitting too her father arrived but by then the
UFO was gone the homeowners arrived shortly later and they found no actual
physical evidence of this encounter except for of course the burned out light bulb in the living
room so Julie was quite traumatized she ended up calling the police who referred
her to the Pennsylvania Center for UFO research and the investigation showed
that she was apparently telling the truth the only thing was she had some confusion about how much time elapsed
during and after the incident I can only imagine what it was like for that poor
girl to see this UFO so close up so close that she could see this ET staring
right back at her so close that she could see the inside of the craft complete with control panels and quite a
lengthy sighting as well it's entirely possible she was taken on board given
the confusion about time though again there's no direct evidence of it it was
a very thoroughly researched case and that alone makes it important it's an
important contribution to our understanding of extraterrestrial
visitations and now moving along to our last and final case in this little
collection I call this one Russian robotic
ETS this is a really remarkable case which involves quite a few Witnesses
some pretty interesting effects as well it occurred on July 6th
1989 in a town called kov Vol Russia not a whole lot of cases are
coming out of Russia certainly that reach the United States so I like that aspect about it but it's such an unusual
series of events and a really unusual ET that the witnesses saw it was around
2:30 p.m. again on July 6 1989 and a group of six children were returning
from just having visited a nearby River and among these children were Sasha
Cavin Olga krova Sergey
bosski Luda rova Sita kartina and Marina
Shera now they walked along the street when they noticed what they looked like
a kite in the sky I mean it was a kite and they ran to go get a better look at
it and this is when they all noticed this sort of yellowish orange glowing sphere alongside the kite one of them
noticed it first and pointed it out to the others but very quickly this light became much brighter it seemed to
approach and then to their amazement it descended downward and landed on the
ground as you can see here at point B in this photo then scooted to the left at
Point a and here is where it stopped this point it still appeared to be a round glowing sphere but almost
instantly the sphere separated into two serrated sections almost like an egg
cracking and you can see illustrations of this by both Sergey and
sveta the two sides of the objects were pulsating with light and coming out from between the two pieces was a very large
tall humanlike figure they could all see that it was taller than a normal person
they said it was about as tall as a bus but very thin with very long arms that
came down past the knees was all gray in color except for the boots which were
black and in the middle of its chest there was a bright pulsating yellow
luminous disc the figure did not appear to have a normal head just sort of a little Dome
it walked stiffly without bending the knees and it really reminded them sort of of a
robot and as it started moving the craft itself
disappeared and as this thing is walking along the field the children saw another
craft floating down in the sky and coming in for a landing in the same
place where the first craft had been meanwhile this robotic figure turned
left and twice and finally walked over to a nearby structure and it disappeared
right next to this sort of telephone Transformer at this point the
children noticed a woman dressed in red who came running out of the bush is about 150 ft away from the e where the
ET had just been and she was actually moving towards where it had disappeared
and they shouted out don't go there is an alien over there the woman didn't
hear them or was too far away to hear them and she continued walking to where this robotic figure had vanished and
seconds later she reappeared about 600 feet to the left
so she had disappeared and then reappeared where this UFO landed and had
disappeared and now she was running away wildly to the left so this is all very
unusual and meanwhile this second craft had landed split apart exactly as the
first one had and out came a second identical robotic looking figure which
behaved in exactly the same way the first one had and as it was moving long
another ship came down and gave a Repeat Performance and the second ET was still
walking when this third craft landed and the second ET disappeared
this third ET came out and was walking by as a fourth craft landed and again
like the others split apart only this time no figure came out so at this point
the children have seen three different ETS this this point all of them vanished
including the fourth craft and after watching for sometime longer to see if
anything else would happen it didn't so the children went home but Sergey the oldest of the group
at age 11 I'll just quote him he said we saw a dot in the sky it grew and grew
very quickly it then went down near the village of cono and rolled around it
rolled down the hill it stopped at those bushes over there and out came a man
without a head he had a glowing disc on his chest his hands were much lower than
his knees he got out and went over to that iron thing that's standing over
there again a telephant Transformer and he was still standing there and looking around as if he was
getting acquainted with the surroundings so it wasn't long before
investigators heard about the case interviewed all the children and in fact Sergey was actually placed
under hypnot hypnosis to try to extract more details and under hypnosis he did
describe these robotic figures in more detail as he said they are very high
they have a head with three antenna on top of the head with tiny silver balls on the end of the antennas the coverall
is gray boot-like attire is black but without a heel
they are thre digited meaning they have three fingers and as sery says the mouth
looks like a triangle with the point on Top there were two small black immobile
points or eyes so these children were all
interviewed by television reporters as well and they went on TV and described what they saw also they were of course
investigated by researchers who were able to locate The Woman in Red that the
boys had seen but she had no memory of seeing any UFOs or beings at that time
she didn't remember anything at all about what the children described but she did say that later on that same
night she and her family had seen a UFO hovering over their home just for a few
moments before it flew off so hearing what the children had described she did agree to be
hypnotized but as the hypnotist brought her closer in time to when the incident
occurred the woman would get a terrible pain in the back of her head was clear
there was some kind of memory block and they were never able to get any further information about
her but further queries revealed that the people around the village had been
seeing UFOs landing in this area particularly near the springs and high
tension wires and it was only two months later when another very similar incident in
veronz Russia would Garner International headlines but the two cases are
extraordinarily similar what an amazing and complex case I suspect that these
kids may have actually witnessed this woman in red being returned from a
non-board experience I think it's entirely possible it's unfortunate that
the woman herself wasn't able to call any real detail about what happened
doesn't even remember the whole incident that the kids themselves saw so that
just raises levels and levels of mystery to this a lot of questions surrounding
that encounter but super interesting because it preceded the really really
famous veronz encounter which got so much publicity and is so darn similar to
to what these kids saw it's an absolutely fascinating case and that's it for today I hope
you've enjoyed this episode where we explored all these different humanoid encounters so many different types of
humanoids that is so fascinating to me it raises questions not only about who
these guys are these visitors to our planet but who we are and the fact that
we are all humanoids also Al teaches us a lot I think about ourselves and our reaction
to being visited there's still a lot to learn about this phenomena which is why
I love doing this this research so yeah hope you've enjoyed this episode maybe
learned something either way I truly thank you for watching it's much
appreciated and until next time keep searching for the truth keep asking those questions and most important of
all keep having Fun.
