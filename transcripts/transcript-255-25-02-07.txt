I COULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT: 10 TRULY INCREDIBLE HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Feb 7, 2025

Summary:
Feb 7, 2025
For many people, a humanoid encounter is one of the most shocking and incredible experiences of 
their lives. When someone experiences something that is completely foreign to their worldview, 
it can be incredibly difficult to understand and process. An encounter can be so shocking that 
it becomes almost impossible to speak about it. This video presents ten very close encounters 
with humanoids, several of which only became investigated through fortuitous circumstances. Many 
of these involve multiple witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence such as landing traces, 
animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more.

THE UFO NEXT DOOR. On the night of May 5, 1952, Ann L Sohn (a nurse) looked out the window of her 
home in Prospect Park, Illinois and saw a massive, saucer-shaped craft. Through the portholes, 
Ann saw humanoids looking down at her. After a few moments, the craft darted away. Later, Ann 
learned that other people in the area saw UFOs on that same night. And the plants where the 
craft had hovered died.

A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED. On the night of December 9, 1960, Madame Dhelens looked out the 
window of her home in Carignan, France and saw an oval-shaped craft landed in the yard. Inside, 
she saw movement through a few portholes. It quickly rose up and darted away. Unknown to her, 
several people in the area also saw it. The next day, a circle of yellowed grass was found where 
the craft had landed.

THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. On the night of March 20, 1967, Jim Rible and his 
daughter Jean decided to take a drive to investigate weird lights in the sky that Jim’s wife 
had seen near their home in Butler, Pennsylvania. They saw the lights, but then the lights 
zoomed at them. Jean heard voices speaking to her mentally. Then five beings appeared in front 
of their car. It scared them so bad, they fled the scene.
 
THE MAN ON THE FLYING BOX. At 5:30 pm one night in November 1974, Giovanna Sensoli was at her 
farm in Case di Mordano, Italy when her animals acted crazily. Looking up, she saw a man in a 
jumpsuit straddling a floating box-shaped craft and looking down at her. A short distance away 
a brilliant object hung in the sky. Giovanna watched in amazement as it moved off and seemed 
to land in a nearby cemetery.

A ROBOTIC BEING. At 1:30 am in mid-September 1977, Luis Almeida was watering the garden behind 
his home in Gondomar, Portugal when a bright light shone on him from behind the brick wall 
bordering his property. Looking up, he was shocked to see that the light was coming from a 
gray, metallic, robot-looking figure at least 6 feet tall. Terrified, he ran inside, and was 
so traumatized, he couldn’t talk about it.

THE DAY THE ETS CAME TO VISIT. It was the night of November 2, 1977 as 16-year-old LC watched 
TV in his aunt’s house in Joaquin Murtinho, Brazil. Suddenly a metallic orb entered his home. 
A tall man dressed in a jumpsuit and two other figures appeared. Going outside, he saw a craft 
in the backyard. The ETs spoke to him telepathically, gave him predictions, then entered their 
craft and departed.

THE ALIEN AND THE FISHERMEN. On the night of February 4, 1978, six men fishing on Lake La 
Florida in San Luis, Argentina got the shock of their life when a saucer appeared overhead 
and released a tall, fair-haired, human-looking man dressed in a silver suit and transparent 
helmet. The man walked up to them, smiled, made a gesture of friendship, and left. The being 
left footprints in the ground, and others saw the UFO.
 
THE SINGING EXTRATERRESTRIALS. On February 1982, two men were in the area of Borok, Russia to 
take photos of monuments when they came upon a landed craft. Two humanoids in jumpsuits emerged. 
One of the men became entranced and immobilized, but the other remained awake as the beings 
approached and communicated to him with harmonic tones. They left after a few minutes, but the 
witness’s life was changed forever.

IT WAS STRANGE. One night in August of 1983, four 12-year-old boys were playing in the woods 
outside their homes in Opole, Poland. Suddenly a thick fog appeared. Moments later, a craft 
landed right in front of them. They saw two humanoids exit and run by them into the forest. 
They gave chase but the ETs eluded them. The craft took off leaving behind undeniable landing 
traces.

“HUMANS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE.” On March 26, 2002, an anonymous salesman was driving outside 
Cazalla de la Sierra, Spain when a pear-shaped craft blocked the road ahead. Looking into the 
field, he saw two very tall humanoids in jumpsuits. He exited his car and spoke with one of the 
beings who was very friendly and told him that Earth was a very beautiful place.

These ten cases are just a small portion of the actual number of cases, and yet they each provide 
amazing insights about ET contact. There are now enough documented cases to conclude that we are 
being visited by extraterrestrials.

Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett. Thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal.
Today I'm going to be talking about one of my favorite aspects of ufology and that is cases involving humanoids. I find
these cases so fascinating. I think they have a lot to teach us. There are so many of them. This is not as rare as I think.
A lot of people think it's the problem is that most people don't talk about it and that in fact is the title of today's episode, 
"I Couldn't Talk About It: 10 Truly Incredible Humanoid Encounters". I gave it that title because this is a real
problem with this subject a lot of people who have this experience are very reluctant to talk about it for a number
of reasons it can affect them very profoundly it's difficult to process an encounter with humanoids especially if
it's something that's completely out of your worldview but there's also a very hostile climate of skepticism
confusion fear ridicule there's all sorts of reasons people are reluctant to
talk about their experiences thankfully that is changing it's one of the reasons why research is so important and that we
all come to accept the fact that we are not alone in this universe as these
cases show so I've chosen 10 cases for you guys today coming from all over the
world including France Italy Poland Portugal Spain also Russia Argentina
Brazil a couple from the United States including Illinois and Pennsylvania these do involve a wide
variety of humanoids mostly human-looking ETS as it turns out there's a case involving robotic type
beings one involving short little humanoids who are probably Grays though this is not entirely clear but
definitely coming from all over the world reaching quite back far in time to
the 1950s all the way up to 2002 and of course these cases are
supported by a wide variety of evidence Landing traces animal reactions
electromagnetic disturbances physiological effects and also very
interesting most of these cases do have multiple Witnesses so it's certainly not
relying on one person's anecdotal eyewitness testimony there is a lot of evidence to support
these cases so let's just get started in the first case I'd like to talk about I
call the UFO next door this occurred in May of 1952 in Prospect Park Illinois
and well technically it is a single witness case there are corroborating Witnesses outside of this particular
singular event which is so interesting this is a very close-up encounter with
the UFO and humanoids with some really interesting Landing Trace effects as
well this case comes from researcher Ted bletcher and it was published in the March 1981 issue of the muon UFO Journal
was 10:50 p.m. one night in May of 1952 when Anne L son she's a registered
nurse she decided to put on a pot of coffee and went into the bedroom of her home to check on her children David and
Lois her husband worked the night shift so he was not there it was a warm and
pleasant evening in Prospect Park Illinois so she went to the window to just look out at the stars and she'd
been there about 1 minute when she suddenly noticed a very bright white glowing round or disc-shaped object
hovering over the vacant lot next door I mean this is very close a small portion
of the craft was obscured by the house next door but she could see most of it and it was large this object was about
30 to 40 ft in diameter and it hovered motionless about 100 ft above the ground
she could see a cloud of steam or vapor coming off the bottom of this craft so
it made it look almost like it was resting on this little Cloud the top of this object had a transparent looking
sort of plexiglass likee dome which was glowing blue but inside this Dome she
could faintly see what looked like two vertical bars or poles standing up most
amazing however was a row of about 15 square-ish windows or Port holes which
were darker than the craft itself most of them the three on the far right
however were illuminated from within by a bright white light this craft was
hovering in complete silent but it was through these illuminated Port holes
that and could see occupants one in each window they were at a distance where it
was difficult for her to see their facial features cuz they were kind of in silhouette from this bright illumination
coming from the port holes but she could see that each was wearing what appeared to be a jumpsuit or coverall a helmet or
a headpiece of some kind which covered everything except their face the light
inside of the craft was really bright she just could not make out their facial features they were only visible from the
chest up and per an the two on the left seemed to be looking down right at her
the third on the far right was standing in profile and appeared to be studying a
panel of dials or instruments in front of him now shocked at what she was seeing an nudged her son David who was
sleeping in bed trying to wake him up but he remained fast asleep again her
husband was at work but aunt's father was asleep in another room in the house
and unfortunately was reluctant to shout out to him she didn't want to leave the window either afraid that this craft
would fly away so wondering what to do she just continued to watch at one point
she saw the figure at the left window make a motion with his hand she had the impression he was pressing a lever of
some kind but immediately after doing this the steam beneath the craft
increased changing in color she said from white to green with flex of Orange
orange in it and at this point the central figure also seemed to push a lever and the craft immediately changed
from white to a brilliant reddish orange color and then zipped upwards at a shallow angle at quote intense speed per
an there was no gradual acceleration this craft just darted off to the north
instantly and was gone in a matter of one or two seconds so the total duration
of this sighting was about 5 minutes she estimates the next morning her husband returned
home from his night shift at the Chicago Tribune where he worked and he believed her because he showed her a newspaper
article which had just been submitted where two families in nearby Round Lake
this is about 19 miles to the northwest of their home had described essentially
the same type of object Anne had seen they saw it at 11:00 p.m. on that same
night immediately after an's encounter and there were a few other interesting
After Effects turns out that there were some Landing traces the neighbors had planted garlic
in the vacant lot over where this craft was hovering and would often go over
there and pick the garlic and use it for cooking so she sent her son over to go
pick some garlic not long after this encounter and to his shock they found
that all the garlic plants were mysteriously missing but not only that
the weeds around them were all dried up and dead in a circle of about 25 ft in
diameter outside of this circle all the weeds and plants were normal the slot
was on the east side of our house where and did have a row of rose bushes which
were doing well and she took great pride in her roses but following this sighting
they all died and also notice that the paint trimming on the east side of her
house was all blistered but only on the east side which was closest to this craft not in any other area finally
there was a row of evergreen trees along the property line dividing her house from the vacant lot and they all died
following this sighting so these are significant Landing trace
evidence there is apparently nothing really special about this area so it's hard to say why these ETS were visiting
this area for the garlic I don't know but it is about 8 miles away from
Chicago's oare airport and there is also a Nike Base West of her neighborhood so
perhaps that's a factor here really hard to say for sure that's such an interesting case I think there's a
misconception that UFO encounters occur solely in rural areas simply not true
most cases happen in Suburban areas which makes sense because that's where most people do Des eyed that's certainly
true in that case and this UFO hovering right next to this person's house amazing and the landing
trace evidence in this case is also super interesting I do wonder what happened to all those garlic plants
where the ETS coming for those I don't know hard to say but it is odd that they all disappeared following this encounter
so it's certainly a really interesting case uh I do wonder what that UFO was
doing there just hovering so close to this witness here's another really
interesting case again coming from all over the world this one comes from France I call this a feeling of being
watched this is a super interesting case which took place on December 9 1960 in
kinan France this is a multiple witness case this has some
incredible very well verified Landing traces thoroughly documented case with
with this landed UFO and humanoids seen inside it or apparent humanoids
something was moving around inside that craft as we shall see this next case was
thoroughly investigated by numerous researchers and was published in the French magazine uranos it's an amazing
case was around 8:00 p.m. as the D family and their friends were finishing
dinner in their home in kinan France Madame Delane was clearing the dishes
while her husband sat in the living room watching TV reading a newspaper and
their friends were also in the living room suddenly a brilliant light Shone from outside and their dogs started
barking furiously now no one in the house paid much attention except for Madame delain she opened the window
looked out and saw a bright object behind the trees just a short distance
away she could see it was landed on the ground this glowing oval-shaped object
about the size of two cars and was sitting in the middle of this Meadow right next to their house on top of this
object she could see sort of a luminous dome which was divided with vertical sections much like an orange she said
this Dome did have two round transparent Port holes and it was through these that
Madame could see two indistinct shadowy forms moving back back and forth so
there was something inside of this craft and as Madame says I felt like I was
being watched and I left that window closing it the dog was still barking so
she knew this was unusual she walked back to the living room looked out the window just in time to see this object
rising up and moving off to the north the dog immediately fell silent but
upset by this strange sight she wanted to tell her husband but due to his poor health she hesitated at the same time as
all of this there was another witness Michelle CES who lived in an out building on the property she was washing
dishes when her dog Tommy began to bark so she went outside to investigate and
immediately saw this same glowing object sitting on the ground she looked at it
through the trees she could hear this loud crackling sound coming from it then
she was amazed to see this oval object rise up to the sky and move off to the north North and just a short distance
away there was another witness who looked outside and saw this object sitting in the field she told her
husband who was reading and he was skeptical he didn't really believe his wife was seeing anything unusual and
told her it was probably just a car she looked again and confirmed that this object could not be a car it was sitting
in the middle of a field she became frightened and just locked the door and did not look
out now the next day Madame delain went to the area where she had seen this
object sitting in the field she was amazed to see a perfect circle of yellowed vegetation about 11 to 12 fet
wide she knew this was important evidence and she very wisely put up stakes and guarded the circle with a
wire and called the newspaper this led to this case being fully investigated by
professional UFO researchers they came confirmed the presence of the circle
took photographs they actually took samples of the grass as well very
quickly the grass in this area did die uh there's not a whole lot that came out
of the analysis of this case other than it appeared that this vegetation had
been exposed to high heat now investigations did reveal that one week
earlier on December 1st 1960 another witness in the area observed a bright
red sphere larger than the Moon flying across the sky and the very next day on
December 2nd another witness described his sighting of a glowing object moving
at nearly the speed of a shooting star further research revealed that there
were quite a few other sightings in this area which apparently were in some way
connected to the December 9 encounter that's the kind of case that makes me
wonder how there can still be Skeptics with this subject when you have that many witnesses Landing traces animal
reactions I mean there's a lot going on here makes it really hard to deny that something very unusual happened in that
location it's an incredible case and so many like it again I called this episode
I couldn't talk about it because most people don't talk about it and that's certainly true in this case which
probably would not have come to light if the investigator hadn't had a connection to the witnesses themselves we see that
in a lot of cases I call this next case the most unforgettable experience of my
life this is a multiple witness case involving three people a mother but
primarily a father and his daughter this occurred on March 20 1967 in Butler
Pennsylvania and this one is a very unusual case I don't know that I've heard of one quite like it it but it's
got some super interesting elements to it and boy did it affect the witnesses
profoundly there's also some interesting corroborating cases that occurred in this area which I think you'll find
quite fascinating this fairly extensive and unusual case began early on the
evening of March 20 1967 the Witnesses are Anonymous they
were given the pseudonyms of the Ribble family so Sarah Ribble the mother was
puzzled by the appearance of unusual lights quote flitting around at low altitude this was near her home in
Butler Pennsylvania which is a fairly smallish town about 35 miles north of
Pittsburgh so she was intrigued by this and told her husband and daughter who
were also very curious so her husband Jim and their daughter Jean decided to
take a drive around the neighborhood to see if they could catch a glimpse of these unusual lights they lived in a
sparsely populated area outside of town about a mile from a private Airfield and
were therefore familiar with aircraft flying in the area now Sarah assured
them that the lights she had seen were maneuvering in such a way that they could not be explained by normal
aircraft so this is why they decided to take a drive that evening and look around to see if they could see these
unusual lights and they drove around the back roads for some time and didn't see
anything but finally just pulled their Volkswagen Bug over onto the side of the
road turned off the lights and decided to wait for a while to see if anything might show up and their patience was
rewarded CU after a few minutes Jim stepped out of the car to get a better View and noticed two Globes of white
yellow light about a mile away they estimate and about 200 F feet up in the
air now these Globes of light were clearly not normal they were nearly the
apparent sides of the full moon and as the father and daughter watched these two Globes of light began to move
towards them as a pair approaching to about a half mile away these two Globes
then crossed over each other's paths Trading Places essentially but still kept moving closer both Witnesses did
notice that these Globes although very bright were not lighting up the area below them this was strange so they were
considering the possibility that they were seeing two small private planes
that perhaps were using this straight road that they were on as a landing strip this didn't make a whole lot of
sense cuz these lights were silent there was a nearby Landing Strip there were no
standard navigation lights it was just these two bright white yellow Globes of
light so they were starting to get nervous at this point then at about a distance of A4 mile
these objects appeared to land on the road at the bottom of this small hill and then started to race towards the
witnesses up this hill at an estimated speed of 70 to 80
mph it looked to the witnesses like two motorcycles spaced about 10 ft apart
whizzing towards them so already concerned and puzzled fear now swept over both Jim and Jean Jim stood outside
out of the car and he was he said absolutely paralyzed with fright while Jean sat in the car and started
screaming to her father oh my God they're coming right at the car so Jim
reached in through the open window on the driver's side and flicked on the car headlights this had no effect the lights
continued to approach seemingly on a collision course no it was at this point
that Jean experienced something very strange and I think highly significant as Jean says as the lights swiftly
approached the car coming down the road I heard A Chorus of voices in my head
not with my ears but I seemed to sense them in my brain the voices said don't
move don't move don't move they kept repeating don't move but they dragged it
out saying don't move so that's very unusual and these
lights Zoom right up to towards them coming to within about 150 ft and Jim
and Jean thought that they were actually going to have a collision with their car so they braced for impact when suddenly
these lights vanished Into Thin Air the voices Jean was hearing telepathically
stopped but the encounter wasn't over yet because now even more astonishing
they saw a group of five humanoids standing in an irregular ular semicircle
facing them right in front of their car as Jean says they just stood about 10 ft
from the car they looked like human beings but their faces were totally devoid of expression and unlike a human
face their eyes if you could call them such were horizontal slits I could not
see any irises or pupes just slits their noses were narrow and pointed not unlike
a human nose and their mouths were just slits like the eyes so four of these
figures were an estimated 5' 7 in tall or so but one was a little bit shorter
5T tall per Jean they had short blonde hair except for the short one who had
shoulder length hair and Jean had the impression that she was female these figures wore caps that were similar to
baseball caps but were dressed in what looked like normal loose fitting clothes sort of gray green shirts and trousers
but they certainly did not look normal not only were their faces different so
was their complexion as Jean says the skin on their faces and hands was roughl
looking it resembled Scar Tissue which has just been severely burned it gave us
the creeps seeing them just stand there doing nothing now the father Jim admits that
he was so frightened he didn't really get a good look at the beings in fact he nearly broke the car door handle in his
haste to get back inside the car but he did and he immediately started the engine backed up and then drove forward
swerving off the road to get by these figures both father and daughter as you
can imagine found this whole encounter incredibly scary as Jean says to this
day the details of this encounter are clear in my mind it was the most unforgettable experience of my life and
my father's too so following this encounter Jean was so hysterical with
fear that Jim had to drive her directly to the local church to visit the
minister they were afraid that this encounter might have been devilish in nature investigators later spoke with
the minister who confirmed that both the father and the daughter did visit him and were really upset shortly after this
incident Jim bravely did return to the scene to look for any evidence but he couldn't find any trace of these craft
or these lights or the men or anything so that is the end of that encounter but
it turns out that this location Butler Pennsylvania does have some history of closeup UFO
encounters for example 11 years earlier on September 5
1956 73-year-old Charles W McGrady and his brother watch watched a gray dish
pan shaped object only 2 and 1/2 ft wide and 8 in thick circle around the sky in
front of them for a full hour this began when Charles brother who lived 9 miles
out of town on kitchening road called his brother Charles to come over as
there was something strange he said flying around his house so Charles drove
out over there and sat on the porch with his brother when this object suddenly
showed up and I'll just let Charles describe in his own words what happened
as he says I looked up and saw it coming under a telephone wire it was about 15
ft from the ground and came within 20 or 25 fet of me it looked like a dish pan
and was not quite as big as a tub it was kind of light gray and round we could
see it plainly it passed under the telephone wire and under a tree by the porch it made 25 or 30 trips in an area
of about 200 ft and we watched it for over an hour it kept the same elevation
and went under the same wire each time to a foot above the ground it didn't
make a bit of noise I never saw anything like it before or since it must have
been a flying saucer it was gray in color and had a light on the front which gave off a grayish light it ran smoothly
without making a sound and gave off a light gray smoke I don't think there was
anyone in it it was too small so at one point Charles considered
throwing something at this object but decided that this would be unwise he
said it moved very slowly at a fast walking speed just a few miles per hour
and would take about 1 and a half minutes each time to complete a full circle as Charles says I kept wondering
why it would go around and around out there it's seemed to be lost he did notice one other detail this object had
two rows of four short 2-in pegs on top of it certainly a strange little
UFO now while both of the above encounters were investigated by researchers here's a brief one that
remains uninvestigated which was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center but is interesting not only
because it occurred in Butler but it does involve a humanoid this witness reported his
sighting in 1999 some 35 years after it occurred again underlining the fact that
most people don't talk about this most people don't report it the encounter occurred on June 1st 1964 when the
witness at that time a seventh grade student was with a group of his friends playing in the woods outside of Butler
when he saw a quote being all black with pointed hands and feet no ears or nose a
slit for a a mouth and a very smooth texture as the witness says we just
stared at each other although I saw no eyes I turned and ran I was truly
terrified to this day it really bothers me what did I see this encounter was so
brief he didn't have a chance to alert his friends so only he saw it but
definitely a very close-up encounter with a humanoid that in some ways is very similar
to what the father and daughter Jim and Jean saw how interesting is that I
really feel a lot for the father and daughter that was clearly a very traumatic experience for them but they
went out looking for UFOs and they got a little bit more I think than they bargained for and certainly other
encounters going on in Butler Pennsylvania makes me wonder it's a pretty small town but I've come to
realize that UFOs are visiting pretty pretty much everywhere on this planet so I'm not sure that that location had any
particular draw to it hard to say I hate to speculate because there's just so
much information in this field that it's almost impossible not to
speculate but something clearly is going on that final case with the tiny little
UFO is also super interesting I wonder about that one I suspect there are lot
lots of witnesses to these events it's just that only a few come forward now let's move to the next case
which I call the man on the flying box this is a really unusual case it's one
of the reasons I wanted to present it because you don't hear a lot like this one this one occurred in November
1974 in castal Romania this is in Italy and this is again is a multiple
witness case which would never have come to light if the investigator hadn't had
a family connection or a friend Connection to the witness themselves so
this is another reason why we know that UFO encounters are far more common than
are publicly documented most people don't talk about it and the witness was
reluctant to talk about it in this case and once you see the details I think you'll understand why because yeah very
unusual ual this very interesting and unusual case comes from researcher Gian
Franco Lino and it first appeared in the UK publication Flying Saucer review Jan
Franco writes this case has been repeatedly and thoroughly investigated by me over a long period of time
involving several return visits there this case occurred in a very small town
called Cas di Morano this is located near Castello in North Northern Italy
you can see the exact location here the witness is senorina giovano seni she was
42 years old at the time and was one evening around 5:30 p.m. in mid November
1974 that giovana was taking care of the animals on the farm when she noticed
that they were all acting very strangely as she says in her own words
chickens and rabbits were running about as though terrified and hiding in any Corner they could find I looked around
to see what was going on and I noticed some of the fowls were looking upward so
I did the same and to my great astonishment I saw hanging in the air
above the house at rooftop height and about 4 M from me a man who was Seated
on a box that was swinging to and fro and who was looking around as though
seeking something he was big about two meters in height and dressed in a very
shiny onepiece garment with green Red and White markings and a pair of skiing
boots with square toes and square heels his features seemed to be dark but a
helmet with a visor covered his face and I only managed to see his eyes more or
less like ours and to tell you the truth we gazed at each other for a brief
instant well this man was hanging in the air above the house and rocking two and and fro with one foot stretched down
towards the roof as though he wanted to support himself from the box there was a
rod sticking up a rod with colored Stripes it must have been a control handle for the motor and it gave out a
sharp hum that I could hear very clearly now per giovana she told her neighbor
this this man actually did Place one of his feet on the roof of her house and
she was close enough that she could see he had abnormally large eyes and what appeared to be teeth now giovana was
shocked and shouted out to her mother who was in the house her mother did not immediately respond and at this point
the man began to move on this floating box over to the threshing area and
giovana was very curious so she followed and she could see that this man was looking off to the North she looked also
and she saw a brilliant light as big as a full moon in fact at L up the area
around her as bright as daylight and she felt this wave of heat the man on this box stopped over a
hay stack and made weird gestures it looked to giovana like he was about to
land on top of this hyack and as giovana says once more we
were staring at each other this time from a distance of about three MERS a
few instants later he departed heading eastwards with that light following at a
distance behind him a bit over a kilometer in that direction lies the small Cemetery of San Clemente located
on a hill I watched the two objects the man and the light circle several times
around the cemetery and halt for a few seconds so yeah here is the cemetery
really interesting case but finally giovan's mother did come out and she saw
this man on the Box off in the distance but by then it was too late for her to see any real detail and immediately this
figure on this floating box dropped down into the cemetery area and was no longer
visible this was quite a long encounter her giovana it lasted about 15 minutes
such a strange case I don't know that I've heard any quite like it there are some that are similar but each case does
have its unique aspects another interesting thing I found out about that case is that this ET presumably ET
seemed to have an interest in going into the cemetery I did a whole episode on UFOs over graveyards that does seem to
be a draw on some occasions I don't know there's always
something to learn from each of these cases it's why I do this research and again super
interesting so let's move to the next case this next case is really quite short there's not a whole lot to it but
I wanted to include it because it involves a very unusually described humanoid which in this case appears to
be robotic this is another example of a witness who really did not want to talk
about what happened to him uh simply because I think it affected him emotionally uh pretty deeply this one I
call a robotic being and this occurred in September of 1977 in gandar Port Portugal again these
cases are occurring all over the world this is a really unusual case this case
was originally investigated by researcher Jose De Jesus leot peso but
was reported on by Albert Rosales thanks to Albert Rosales for his
amazing work in documenting humanoids the witness in this case is Luis Mor
Luna Almeida he was a 38-year-old banker at the time of this incident
was 1:30 a.m. early one morning in midt of 1977 as Louise was watering the garden
behind his home located in gandar Portugal looking up he noticed a strange
figure standing just about 100 ft away a little less behind the brick wall that
divided his home from his neighbor's home Louis could see only the top half
of this figure who he estimates was fairly tall perhaps about 6 ft high but
really wide 3 ft wide he noticed this figure because it was shining a very
intense gray blue light at the witness he says this figure looked robotic with
very broad shoulders a small squarish head in the head section where the face
would be was this white square face plate which contained a circle inside of
it and it was this circle which was the source of the light was flashing an
orange light in and out with quote extraordinary slowness so seeing that this being was
clearly not human Louise instantly panicked he stared at this strange
figure for only a few short moments unable to move due to the shock and strangeness of this being but after a
few moments fear overcame his inability to move and he fled in Terror back into
his house his wife and mother upon seeing him saw that he was pale white
and his hair was standing on end he was so deeply traumatized by the encounter
that he was unable to speak about the incident he did not go outside to investigate and it was in fact some time
before he could even talk about it to anybody uh he did finally talk to
researcher Jose De Jesus but then only did so with extreme reticence how
interesting is that I have to wonder what this robotic being was was doing there just kind of looking at this
witness it's a shame he had such a strong fear reaction and ran inside cuz
perhaps this could have been a more extensive encounter and the strong fear reaction people have certainly does have
an effect on how an encounter unfolds uh I really am curious about why
people are so fearful of a being that you know they
don't understand perhaps I guess it's the of the unknown that causes people to
react this way but it's unfortunate because again this being didn't do
anything to him it was just looking at him so I don't know I mean I understand
certainly when something happens that's completely out of your worldview it's very difficult to
process but to be so traumatized to the point of not even being able to talk about it this is an important aspect uh
because we really do need to be able to talk about these things there are so many people having this experience we
really should be able to discuss it more openly publicly and support people who
are having these kinds of experiences so let's move to the next case this one is super interesting
really quite extensive involving communication with the primary witness and the ETS I call this one the day the
ETS came to visit this is a really interesting case involving human-looking
ETS it occurred on November 2nd 1977 in Wakim martinho this is in Brazil minus
Garis Brazil and yeah a really extensive case involving multiple ETS and a really
interesting interaction with the witness who as you can imagine was affected very
profoundly so profoundly he couldn't actually talk about it for quite some
time so I think you'll find this one really fascinating and unique this very
weird and unusual case comes from Brazilian researcher Professor jio Brandt
alesio the witness is anonymous he's known only by his initials
lcja he was 16 years old at the time of this incident it occurred on the night
of November 2nd 1977 LC was alone in the house
in waim martinho and he was watching TV this is his aunt's house it was located
on D Oscar de Ola Street you can see it here so as he's watching TV suddenly the
sound of high wind swept through the house which was strange because it was a calm evening and he also heard what
sounded like footsteps instantly Elsie saw this small strange machine enter through the
kitchen door into the living room where he sat the kitchen door opened and in comes this machine now this was weird
because the house was locked up all the doors were closed so this was inexplicable and this little machine per
the witness LC was shaped kind of like a sphere with a flat section around the
perimeter very much like the planet Saturn and it was only a few feet across
this globe glowed with light and the flat section also glowed with a golden
light and it flew silently towards the TV causing the plug to come out of the
electrical socket and fall gently to the floor then exited the room swept through
the kitchen and the bedroom floating about 3 ft above the floor then moved back into the kitchen so LC stood up and
was watching this in absolute shock when suddenly a 6ot tall man appeared to his
left now this man looked human he had pale yellowish skin blue eyes eyebrows
that curved upwards a small black goatee beard he was wearing a skintight
jumpsuit with a belt green boots and gloves and had a transparent Helmet or
visor on top of his head uh he was also wearing what looked like a sort of metallic helmet now the belt he was
wearing was full of what looked like black buttons and there was a little small gray tube which hung from it this
man immediately made a gesture with his right arm which caused a brilliant light to illuminate the inside of Elsie's
house and this figure disappeared so Elsie ran outside and he
saw that this small Saturn shaped object was now floating in his backyard spinning in place and immediately three
humanoid figures approached him from his right one was the man who had just appeared in his living room the other
two were a shorter woman and what appeared to be a young boy all three of these figures were dressed the same the
two did not have a helmet and headgear like the man did but this man began to
speak telepathically to LC telling him to remain calm this point the man and
woman grabbed ELC by his arms and ELC found himself floating back into the
house into the living room they left him standing there and then sat on the couch
as if kind of trying it out then the men and the boy walked into the bedroom they
raised their hands and opened the closet doors through apparent telekinesis cuz the doors opened by themselves they
examined the contents of the closet with great interest meanwhile the woman laid
down on the bed in the bedroom as if to test it then all three of them just
walked out into the backyard LC followed and he was amazed at this point to see a
very large Dome shaped craft with a flat bottom section it had a large glass-like
opening and there was a Stairway leading down to this craft CU this craft was
floating above the ground but the terrain swept downwards so it was actually lower than
LC and this craft was pretty big per the witness it was about the size of a house
and these humanoids led him down the steps so that he could look through this
transparent door way directly into the craft and standing right in front of
this doorway he could see that the interior of the craft was brightly illuminated and he saw several other
crew members identical to the three that he was outside with except they were
sitting in front of what looked like complicated instruments of some kind then these three figures led the witness
back up these stairs which again were extruding from the craft itself and into his backyard they step Ste away and
began speaking audibly to him in some foreign language that he could not
understand it was at this moment that the witness's neighbor shouted out saying that she was going to return an
item that she had borrowed from his aunt apparently this neighbor was unaware
that the witness's aunt was not home at this time and also apparently unaware of all the strange activity that was going
on in the backyard at this point a fourth figure identical to the first man instantly
appeared next to the witness he held a tube like device in his hand which he held up and made a sweeping gesture with
it instantly all three of the figures standing next to the witness disappeared
the small saturn-like object which was spinning in the backyard moved to the side of the house as if hiding so the
witness went and got the item from his neighbor and then immediately rushed back into the backyard and all three
Figures were still there now this is when The Tall Man did something very
strange he pressed one of the buttons on his belt which caused this weird device
to appear in midair this device per the witness was kind of like a shiny plate
and it moved and pressed right up against the witness's right hand first
and then against his left hand uh the witness had the sense the impression
that they were making a recording of some kind the three humanoids then lined up in a row right in front of the
witness and one by one they put their hand on his chest and each of them told
him telepathically we shall return they then walked up to their craft the stairs
retracted the door closed and this craft took off so the witness stumbled back
into the house he was disoriented couldn't believe what had just happened and looking around everything was normal
including the TV which was now plugged in and back on so completely flustered he decided to go
outside and purchase some cigarettes to calm down but as he reached for the house keys which were hanging on a hook
on the wall he was shocked to see the keys rise up and float into his hand he
stepped outside and he saw that this little Saturn shaped object was now flying out of his backyard up into the
sky at a diagonal angle so he went to the store still in
such a State of Shock that he couldn't speak he couldn't even ask for the cigarettes now the people at the store
knew him well and they figured something really traumatic must have happened to him perhaps there was an emergency at
his home so they rushed to his home thinking there must be a fire or something it took the witness some time
to explain what happened he later explained to researchers that at this
time the beings were still mentally communicating with him he doesn't remember everything they said they were
telling him such things as quote we have come from very far away they said
something about hundreds and hundreds of years they also said quote grave
problems are going to occur in your family now this turned out to be true
because it was shortly later that one of Elsie's Brothers narrowly escaped injury
or possibly death when the truck he was driving fell into to a lake thankfully
he was all right but just a few days later another brother accidentally
thrust his hand through a glass window severing an artery in his wrist he was
Gravely injured but thankfully survived that case had some really
interesting elements not only how it affected like the television but the fact that this
witness had apparent telekinesis immed immediately following his experience
as well as these predictions that the ET gave to him which came true shortly later super interesting stuff these
cases again have so much to teach us now let's move to the next case this one is
really well known in the country but you know I hadn't heard of this one so I'd be surprised if you have too uh but I
think it's an important case which really adds to our knowledge of what's going on here on this planet in terms of
extraterrestrial visitations I call this one the aliens and the fishermen this
occurred on February 4 1978 in Lake La Florida this is in San
Louie Argentina I love this case there are six
Witnesses all of high credibility some really interesting Landing trace
evidence and just a fascinating interaction with a human looking ET who
apparently just came to say hi as you'll see it's just an amazing case it was the
evening of February 4 1978 as Jano Luis Sosa and Pedro rul Sosa both brothers
and two of their friends Reino Salvador Peroni and yaso Eduardo Lucero decided
to drive off in gano's Fiat to go pick up their other two friends Ramon Armando
Sosa and Manuel Mara Alvarez these six men were fishing buddies they fished
together regularly and they were planning a night of fishing at Lake La Florida located in San Louis
Argentina they soon arrived at the LA Florida nautical and fishing club where
they heated up some empanadas ate them along with a liter of
wine and conversed with each other around a half hour after midnight they
got on their boat and went on the lake and rode around a little bit to find a calm spot but ended up fishing very near
to the shore the fish weren't biting that well so around 3:30 a.m. they
pulled up to the shore three of the men janaro Ramon and Lucero were tired so they laid down on
the Lake Shore prepared to catch some sleep but Manuel and Pedro stayed on the
boat and continued fishing and Reino also continued fishing just a short
distance away from Shore all three did manage to catch some fish some silver
sides and carp but it was around 4:15 a.m. when something very strange
happened Reino was the first to see This brilliant light in front of the Moon he
cried out waking up janaro and Ramon from their sleep now both just assumed
this was an unusually brilliant shooting star and didn't think too much of it went back to sleep but it was just a
half hour later at 4:45 a.m. that events escalated a brilliant white light
appeared from behind a hill just 60 ft away Manuel and Pedro who had been
facing the other direction immediately turned around to look Reino was facing this light and he said it was so bright
he had to cover his eyes to protect them from the Brilliance the other three men who were sleeping on the ground
immediately woke up because this light was so bright as to light up the area around them like daylight so all six men
were standing and looking in Wonder at this light and could see now that it was
in fact a gray saucer-shaped object about 45 maybe 60 fet wide they watched
it rise up from behind the hill and hover about 10 to 15 ft right above the
ground they said it was covered with colored lights red and green mostly and
sent down This brilliant beam beam of white light onto the ground immediately
a door opened and something somewhat like a rope ladder came down a humanoid
figure appeared in the opening and began to descend down this ladderlike device
this being was tall 6 feet perhaps seven and he was wearing a skintight shiny
scaly silver uniform sort of a jumpsuit and what looked like a transparent
Fishbowl type helmet this this jumpsuit appeared to be almost glowing all six
Witnesses could see that this figure had a pale complexion blonde hair blue eyes
very fine features a perfect physical build one of the witnesses Manuel
described this being's complexion as quote Rosy very healthy and strong so
this figure very quickly reached the ground and he walked or seemed to Glide even towards the men approaching to
within about 45 ft he then made a quote enigmatic smile he smiled at them put
his arms out with his palms upward and what they interpreted as a gesture of
friendship and welcomeness the witnesses could now see that this figure was wearing mittens of some kind and that
was it he immediately turned around walked back to this ladder climbed up it
re-entered the craft this ladder retracted the door closed and after
about 20 to 30 seconds the craft rose up and and moved off towards the mountains to the Northwest at a 45° angle
maneuvered a large half circle and was gone leaving a glowing luminescence in
its wake so this entire incident lasted no more than one minute all of the men
agreed that this craft could not have been from Earth and again this incident garnered an enormous amount of publicity
and was widely published in Argentine newspapers and did in fact prompt an
investigation by the Argentine police and the military it got a lot of attention because these Witnesses were
of high credibility and also an investigation revealed that there were
Footprints from The Entity as you can see these were photographed and a study
of these prints showed something very interesting this being apparently weighed about four times the weight of a
normal man these Footprints showed a stride in excess of 4 feet so perhaps he
was gliding but he did touch the ground this footprint measured almost 12 in
Long 6 and 1/2 in wide but it was 2 in deep with very deep heel
Impressions soil samples were collected and analyzed where this craft had hovered but showed no signs of anything
unusual no radioactivity no magnetism no exposure to heat but it turned out there
were other Witnesses in the area who saw this they described sightings of an
unusual craft in the sky in that area on that night what a case that is that one
yeah got a lot of attention in the media also it's really interesting because
that was investigated by the police by the Argentine government who apparently
informed us officials about what happened so this was a case that was
taken very seriously because again there were six Witnesses of high credibility
parent Landing trace evidence Footprints as we're able to see actual photographs
of which is always interesting just a fascinating case all around and here's
another one you know you can dismiss one or two of these cases 10 or 20 even 100
but the fact is there are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of these events which even then is just the tip of the
iceberg so this next case I found super interesting I call this one the s in
extraterrestrials this occurred in February 1982 in Boro this is in urav
Russia I wanted to include this case because often there is a musical aspect
to some of these encounters when the ET speak it's often described as being very
sing song Some people do hear music in association with their encounters and
that's certainly true in this case in the interaction with the witness and
these these humanoids also involved some really I mean it's just I don't think
I've heard anything quite like this but he started communicating in the same way the ETS were so that alone makes this
case super important because it CHS an aspect of ET communication that I don't
think we fully understand uh but yeah just an amazing case this case comes
from prolific researcher Anton anov was early evening one night in February of
1982 this is in the small town of Boro yaras slavo has two men by the name of
Alexander kosikov and vital they were in this area
to photograph monuments and suddenly Alex noted that vital was pale white and motionless so
he realized instantly something was wrong he turned around and was amazed to see a large gray blue crap of some kind
much in the shape of a loaf of bread he said about 12 to 15 ft in diameter had
no markings no windows just smooth skinned craft he did have his camera
ready so he immediately snapped a photograph of it now at this point the craft began to sort of move at least
part of it did a sort of door opened up on the top very much like a blooming flower is how he described it other
protrusions seem to come out of the top and this is this is when two humanoids appeared exited the craft and walked
towards the men right up to them approaching to less than 10 ft and per
Alexander they were very much human looking but were about 7 ft tall very
slender for Alexander both these figures looked identical had very close set eyes
but beautiful facial features he said that they were wearing kind of tan tight
fitting jumpsuits that had sort of a hor Frost texture to them and he said their
entire bodies seemed to Glow with this fluorescent Violet pink which was so bright it made it difficult for him to
see their faces so stopping right in front of Alexander these two beings then
began to emit beautiful musical tones speaking in a sort of melodic purring
noise this is how Alexander described it he said their mouths were open and their lips were moving this was absolutely
Audible and it seemed to him as though these beings were singing now it was
during this time Alexander quickly took another another photograph but to his amazement
Alexander found himself answering these beings with these same melodic tones
emanating seemingly against his will though his tones he said were single syllables and shorter than the
ETS also very strangely he understood that they were communicating to him that
he should calm down and not be afraid they basically told him that they came
from a place with three stars and had a fairly long conversation about 10
minutes quite a bit more was said though Alexander says he couldn't remember any
more of what this conversation was about finally the ETS just turned around
walked back into the opening of this object which immediately closed up leaving no seams or markings and the
next thing Alexander knew this object was hovering over the forest he did not actually see it rise up it was just
suddenly over in another position hovering about 450 ft high at which
point it disappeared looking where the object had landed on the ground he didn't see any Landing
traces now once this object disappeared Alexander's friend vital Broke Free of
his trance now he did not recall any conversation all he could really remember was the initial segment of this
encounter seeing the craft and the beings that's all he remembered
Alexander of course did remember conversing with the beings but could only remember that one little bit of
what they said following this experience he was very eager to develop his photographs
but to his great disappointment none of the pictures came out they were all just white and
Overexposed the only other after effect of this encounter was that afterwards
Alexander says he felt a great calmness overcome him and he became much more
philosophical about life what a cool case that was I mean some really interesting elements to it and the
witness had a camera with him and did take pictures what a shame that they didn't come out but that case is
important because it shows how difficult it is to take photographs of
humanoids I think that there's an energy field going on when people are right
next to a UFO or humanoids or sometimes they intentionally do not allow people
to take photographs but there's you know this case I think explains to some extent why
there are not more photographs of humanoids CU he did try and these photographs did not come out but a super
interesting case also because the witness was so affected spiritually completely changed his outlook on life I
think that's more the rule than the exception experience with an extraterrestrial
completely changes the way a person views themselves and their place in this
universe so now we move to another case which I call it was strange this was in
August or September of 1983 possibly 1984 the witness isn't
entirely certain of the exact date but it's a great case because there are
multiple Witnesses really interesting Landing trace evidence it's quite an
extensive interaction as well this one occurred in Ole Poland and yeah was
thoroughly investigated as well so that alone makes it an important case this
truly amazing case comes from Daman tra author of a few books about UFOs it was
around 9:00 p.m. 1 evening in August of 1983 possibly 84 when the witness matus
that's a pseudonym he was 12 years old he and his best friend tomek and two
other friends were playing in the fields and forests near their home in opole Poland this is not too far from the
village of gas La suddenly and very quickly this strange fog began to form
in the field next to them and this was not a normal fog it was very dense and
as matus says chaotic and quite strange so
unnatural and it was shortly later that they all began to hear this sound like a
loud buzzing of bees and after a few moments this sound became louder and louder as if whatever was making it was
approaching them from the fog but this fog was very dense they couldn't see anything and thinking this buzzing might
be coming from a farmer in his tractor the boys backed away so that they wouldn't be running run over by whatever
was approaching but as matus says as the sound grew it turned out that it was
coming from above when we raised our heads up we saw a light falling down a
very bright and white light it turned out that it was an object emanating a light on which vertically arranged
strips were visible panels of white light after a while the object landed in
the fog literally just just in front of us about 15 M away we looked at it in
disbelief the object resembled a soup bow so this craft was huge matus
compared it to two buses and estimates that it was at least 150 ft wide he said
the surface of this craft was very smooth it did have these panels but as
soon as it landed the panels lining the side of this craft began to Blink cyclically sort of in red and white
light so the boy stood there utterly speechless in absolute amazement until
after just a few minutes figures began to emerge from this craft toch wondered
if they might be animals but it quickly became clear that it was two humanoids
each about 4 feet tall with very slim bodies these figures immediately began
to move towards the area where the boys had been playing and these figures moved so quickly it wasn't clear to these boys
whether these figur Figures were running or actually floating just above the ground they seemed to Glide and also
they were making no sound as they moved along the uneven terrain as matus says
we started chasing them but it wasn't easy every now and then we stumbled the
two beings moved quite agile at some point one of our group I can't remember who shouted out to them hey and one of
those creatures stopped they looked ahead we stood there so at this point
the boys were able to get about 60 ft away from this being the being then turned and continued running towards the
forest and disappeared into the trees where the boys had been playing only moments earlier it was at that moment
that the craft began to Glow an intense white light the buzzing sound increased
the craft rose majestically upwards matus said he felt compelled to approach
closer and once he got close to it this craft was already several meters
overhead and to his amazement as it shot upwards it created a clear tunnel
through the fog just zoomed upwards and disappeared into the night sky and
through this tunnel in the fog matus could now see the Starry Sky very
quickly this weird fog swirled around and filled up this hole so the entire encounter lasted about they estimate 7
minutes they never did see these beings enter back into the craft so that was a
little strange but all the boys were absolutely astonished at what had happened they didn't want to talk about
it to others because they were afraid of being disbelieved it all sounded so
crazy to them that they couldn't expect other people to believe it but they did
return the next day and they found weird marks on the ground where this craft had landed there were three perfectly round
holes in the ground each about 4 and 1/2 ft deep and as matus says there was no
trace of Doug earth that could be seen around them it was very strange also perhaps significant is
around that time farmers in the area were reporting strange sort of circles
like crop circles appearing in their fields this is only about 450 500 ft
away from Where the boys had seen this craft and these circles were appearing both before and after this encounter so
this does not appear to be one off the farmers were blaming the children for these circles but peratus the kids were
as mystified by the circles as everyone else they found them very interesting and fun to play in but it was not them
he says making them namus reported no strange after effects from this
encounter but he did say that at age 26 years later he twice woke up feeling
paralyzed in his bedroom with the sense of a Pres in his room the air on both
occasions seemed to drop several degrees but on the second occasion he was able to fight this paralysis and raised his
head and he saw what he described as a hooded figure he couldn't make it out
very well and after about two seconds he lost Consciousness another undeniable
case I mean with six Witnesses yes they were children but when you have that many witnesses it's really hard to deny
that something really profound happened there and of course there are the landing traces to me what's also very
interesting about that case is that the primary witness matus had experiences
following this encounter that is a pattern that turns up in a number of cases uh could be the reason behind the
encounter uh that this was just one of many events in his life involving
extraterrestrials hard to say for sure but an amazing case I also found it fascinating how the e ET s moved even
though there wasn't a whole lot of interaction between the ETS and the witnesses it's this is a detail that
does turn up in a number of cases where these humanoids appear to Glide across the ground so that I think is also
really fascinating stuff all right now let's move to the last and final case in
this compilation this is another really interesting case which I call humans
don't know what they have this occurred on March 2 6 2002 in kazala De La Sierra
this is in Savilla Spain and I like this case because although it is a single
witness case the witness was provided with some really interesting information
the ETS did communicate with them and what they had to say was really
fascinating so I think you'll find it a pretty compelling case this final case comes from researcher Francisco padron
with 3 P.M in the afternoon of March 26 2002 when an anonymous pharmaceutical
salesman was driving along a deserted Road outside of the small town of kazala
De La Sierra you can see it here located in seevilla Spain and ahead of him on
this little road the witness noticed a shiny pear-shaped object resting on
three Landing legs sitting in the middle of the road so he drove closer and
looking around saw two humanoid figures standing in the field next to the road
he parked his vehicle and walked up to these two figures in hindsight he says he felt almost as though he was in a
trance that perhaps he had even floated towards these beings and he saw that
they were not quite normal they were over 7 and 1/2 ft tall both were wearing
white tight fitting plastic looking jumpsuits and what looked like astronaut
helmets they were quite heavy set he said with wide chests but had long thin
legs they looked human but he could see their faces through the helmets there
was a clear face plate and he could see that their eyes were very light Almost White and their faces had sharp quote
refined features one of the figures immediately turned and walked back to the craft
sitting in the middle of the road and the witness noticed that his movements were very slow and clumsy as if he had
trouble walking now the other remained standing in front of the witness it was at this point that
the witness was absolutely convinced that this craft in the road was an extraterrestrial craft and that the
figure standing in front of him was quote not from this Earth so he asked this ET if he needed
assistance and per the witness the humanoids seemed happy to receive this offer but replied that no everything was
in order and then proceeded to tell the witness that the Earth was very beautiful and added quote humans don't
know what they have where we come from we don't have such beautiful scenes they
disappeared a long time ago so this is repeating that theme we
hear so often about the importance of protecting the environment the witness
also noticed another strange detail the man's speech seemed hesitant and he also had a very strange
accent so a ounded the witness asked this man where he was from the ET smiled
in a very friendly way and said that he was From Another Dimension that was the
impression of the witness but it was something at that time which he didn't fully understand the figure then waved
goodbye walked back to the craft still sitting in the road walking in that same clumsy way and disappeared inside it and
this craft took off how cool is that this is not the only case I've heard
where ETS Mark upon the beauty of our planet that's really cool I also found
it super interesting that this witness described the ETS moving in a sort of a
clumsy hesitant way makes me wonder if perhaps they came from a planet with a different gravity pure speculation but
we see these cases where ETS seem to have trouble moving around others where they Glide across the ground super
easily again each case provides a little bit more information something to teach us for sure I think
the most important takeaway from these cases is the simple fact that we are not
alone and with so many cases it's impossible to deny I said it earlier but
it's worth repeating one or two cases could be easily dismissed or 10 or 20 or even a
hundred but thousands upon thousands I don't think so and again with most of
these cases having multiple Witnesses this is another misconception in this
field people think it's a single witness out in the country no evidence someone
of low credibility perhaps not educated or naive in some way it's simply not
true people from every level of society are having these experiences they are
occurring everywhere in urban areas and Rural they've been occurring for a very
long time so this all points towards this being absolutely genuine it's time we
accept the fact that Earth has been visited by extraterrestrials so that's it for today
thank you guys I truly appreciate you watching I hope you learned something I hope you found it interesting but thank
you so much it's because of you guys I do this research so until next time keep
asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun I'll
see you next episode episode bye for now
