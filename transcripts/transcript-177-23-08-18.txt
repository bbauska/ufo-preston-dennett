UFOS & WEIRD ANIMAL STORIES
Aug 18, 2023

Summary:
Aug 18, 2023
There are all kinds of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, onboard experiences and more. Then there are the cases involving animals. In fact, one of the categories of UFO evidence involves animal reactions, and there are many examples. Much rarer are cases where weird things happen to animals. This video presents eight cases in which weird things happen to animals during UFO encounter. These cases involve the entire range of UFO encounters and a wide variety of animals. These cases span six decades, involve many witnesses, and come from all over the world. And all of them are just a bit weird!

THE FLOATING HORSE. On Oct 16, 1954, Guy Puyfourcat led his mare to his home in Cier-de-Riviere, France. His horse got spooked and glanced to the right. Guy saw three figures dart into the bushes. He then heard a shrieking sound as a small, gray, saucer-shaped craft rose 150 feet, then moved toward him and stopped briefly, at which point his horse levitated 9 feet into the air. The craft darted away, and his horse dropped, temporarily paralyzed. After 10 minutes, it got up, sweaty and trembling.

THE PARALYZED DOG. On Oct 17, 1954, Maxime Pignatelli was hunting with his dog along the Durance River near Corbieres, France. Looking ahead of him, he saw a 12-foot-wide black oval object on the ground. On top was a dome, and inside he saw two child-like beings. The two figures exited the craft. Maxime’s dog ran toward them, but Maxime panicked, falling into a ditch. His dog came crawling back, howling and dragging its back legs. As they fled, Maxime felt a wave of tiredness come over him.

THE SHEEP SLAUGHTERING ALIEN. One night in 1968 Valentina Flores of Otoco, Bolivia, was herding her lamas into their pens when she noticed saw that strange netting had been placed over it and a 4-foot-tall humanoid was inside, using a tube-like instrument to kill her sheep. She threw rocks at him. He responded by throwing his hooked instrument at her which cut her arms and returned to his hand like a boomerang. The figure grabbed the netting, rose into the air and disappeared. Valentina saw that 34 sheep had been killed.

GOAT KIDNAPPED BY ETS. On Sep 22, 1972, a peasant woman from Villa Altagracia in the Dominican Republic was shocked to see a strange craft covered with lights landed on the ground. Out came two short beings who proceeded to grab a goat. The goat seemed to be paralyzed as the two short beings carried it into the craft, which took off at great speed and disappeared from sight.

CAN WE HAVE FOUR OF YOUR RABBITS? On the night of Aug 17, 1977, Marco Antonio de la Cuadra woke up in his home in Alto Jahuel, Chile. An odd buzzing sound was coming from his rabbit hutch. Going outside, he came upon an oval object landed on the ground. In front of it was a human-looking male with blond hair wearing a tight-fitting white suit. The man said he was part of a scientific exploration looking for new species to help re-populate his planet. He wanted fish. Marco said he had no fish, but he did have rabbits.

THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE CHICKENS. On the night on Mar 3, 1980, Vivian Rodriguez woke up to her dogs barking and a commotion on the porch of their home in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Looking outside, she saw 5 short humanoids searching the porch. She woke up her brother, Jose, and they watched as the beings showed a great interest in their chickens. The figures fled when a car approached. Unknown to the siblings, only a few miles away, two men saw the same figures climb into a landed UFO which took off over the city.

I SAW A DOLPHIN ONBOARD A UFO. In Jan 1981, a woman and her mother were driving on a highway in Manchester, England when suddenly there were no other cars. They saw a strange light ahead of them and noticed an old-fashioned car. Suddenly the car turned into a UFO, which disappeared. Getting home, they noticed that they were missing 2 hours. Under hypnosis, the witness recalled being taken onboard the craft where she saw a human-looking ET. He led her into a room where there was a small pool and a sick dolphin.

PIG-SNATCHING ALIENS. In the wee hours of the morning of Sep 12, 2006, Evan Briese of Tappen, ND woke up and saw something in their pig corral. Thinking it was a coyote, he grabbed his rifle. To his shock, he saw two 8-foot-tall beings stealing their pregnant sow. Evan fired his gun. One of the beings screamed while the other flew towards him and knocked him unconscious. Upon awakening, Evan saw that his shirt was ripped to shreds and the pregnant sow was gone. And this was just the beginning.

These cases reveal an alien agenda that includes a strong interest in animals of all kinds, and that ETs can affect animals in ways we are only beginning to understand. Whether it’s levitating a horse, paralyzing a dog, killing sheep or taking rabbits and pigs, the ETs are visiting many locations all across are planet, and have been doing so for decades.

Hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal 
I call today's episode UFOs and weird animal stories yeah you heard right today I want to 
talk about UFOs and some encounters that involve animals in a little bit of a different way 
I mean there are tons and tons of cases involving animal effects for example dogs barking when a 
UFO shows up or farm animals acting Restless this sort of thing but this goes a little bit 
deeper than that these are some more of the strange and unique cases that I found which 
I think have something interesting to say about the UFO phenomenon these kinds of cases should 
really come as no surprise because obviously ETS are interested not only in humans and in 
Plants but animals of all kinds I did a previous episode called alien zoos where people have been 
taken on board and seen all kinds of animals certainly I talked quite a bit about that in 
my book symmetry involving Dolly saffron who saw a lot of this sort of stuff going on first hand 
but what I've collected here are eight cases which are a little bit more unusual 
some quite poignant uh some a little bit harrowing or Grim even but definitely I think all of them 
have something important to contribute to our understanding of UFOs and these et's visiting our 
planet so that's why I wanted to do this episode for you today and let's just get started and this 
first episode I call the floating horse this one actually took place in Sierra de riviere France 
it involves one witness who was walking his horse home when something very unusual happened 
this case took place on October 16 1954 and involves a farmer a 22 year old farmer by 
the name of guy puy forecast he was leading his mayor through the fields near his home in 
Sierra de Riviera France and the horse became frightened and started looking to the right 
at this point guy heard three shrieking sounds coming from the bushes to his right 
and according to one report on this case he saw three creatures run into the bushes 
other reports don't mention the creatures but I put that there because certainly one did and there 
are many reports on this case however seconds later according to the witness he saw a five 
foot wide gray kind of round pan-shaped object rising up from behind these bushes and it Rose 
150 feet into the air and then came towards him so as it passes overhead it stopped briefly right 
over guy and his horse and at this point guy's horse rose up nine feet into the air high enough 
that he could no longer hold on to the reins for fear that he would be pulled up with his horse 
this lasted just a few seconds the craft darted away at which point the horse dropped back down 
fell on its side and remained motionless for 10 minutes it then did stand up but it was covered 
with sweat and mud it was trembling with fear and it stumbled all the way home strangely guy 
himself felt absolutely nothing he felt no sense of weight weightlessness No Effects at all so that 
is strange so there you go that's the case of the floating horse and no it's not a pegasus it didn't 
have wings I don't know what's going on in that case but it seemed almost intentional I suppose 
it could have been an accidental byproduct of this UFO hovering so low over the horse 
but it didn't affect the horse's owner so that makes that theory a little bit suspect really 
hard to say but it's certainly an interesting case and here's another one which I call the paralyzed 
dog this actually occurred one day later also in France more specifically in corbiere France 
in this case kind of touched my heart a little bit because the effect on this dog was really quite 
dramatic this case occurred on October 17 1954 as I said one day after the above case and not 
that far away I mean you consider how the UFOs can fly so quickly this wasn't corbier France 
the main witness is a gentleman 65 years old by the name of Maxime Pignatelli 
and he was out hunting with his dog along the banks of the Durants River and he was taking 
aim at a quail as it flew from a Thicket when he saw a black oval object about 12 feet across this 
was landed on the ground not far away on the top section he could see a small Dome with two small 
child-like beings wearing helmets at this point these two little beings began to exit The Craft 
Maxine's dog ran towards them barking but Maxine himself was shocked and frightened 
he actually panicked and ran right into a ditch filled with water soaking himself up to the neck 
moments later his dog reappeared howling and whining in fear and was dragging its back two 
legs as though they were paralyzed he was pretty much convinced that the ETS had done something 
to his dog but they didn't say what happened next all the reports just say that at this point Maxine 
left the area with his dog and as he's walking home in overwhelming tiredness swept over him 
so he felt that this was an unusual effect perhaps it was the cause of him being so frightened but 
he didn't seem to think so certainly his family verified this effect thankfully by all accounts 
his dog was all right so it does have a happy ending in that regard yeah I like that case a 
lot even though the poor dog was left partially paralyzed temporarily think Heavens but wow it's 
so awesome to see that the dog ran towards this UFO clearly to protect his owner but yeah um had 
quite an interesting effect from approaching these et's and here is another case which honestly I've 
never heard one quite like this it's quite Grim I am not sure what to make of it it being so unique 
but I do think it's important to present and it does appear to be a legitimate case it's well investigated and I call this the Sheep slaughtering alien so yeah this one does have some 
sort of difficult Grim elements to it just a little warning there but definitely a 
very interesting case to say the least we don't have the exact date of this next case 
this occurred in early 1968 in otoko Bolivia otoko is a small Village near uyani in Southwest Bolivia 
we do know the main witness her name is Senora Valentina Flores and it was around 6 PM one 
evening in 1968 when she went to Corral her sheep and llamas which were grazing about in the fields 
approximately a half mile from her Farm and she had corralled all the Sheep put them up in their 
little pen there and then went to get her llamas and as she's walking her llamas back to her Farm 
she saw that the Sheep pen had this weird sort of strange plastic netting covering it and looking 
inside the pen she saw a very short male humanoid moving around inside he was somewhere between 
three and four feet tall he wore a jumpsuit with a backpack and a helmet on his head otherwise he 
was basically human in appearance but in his hand he held a tube-like device with a hook on the end 
which he was apparently using to slaughter her sheep now her first thought was this was a sheep 
wrestler and that he was stealing her sheep so she immediately began throwing rocks at this intruder 
but at this point this entity moved over to a small device which sat on four legs on the ground 
and it looked to valentina's sort of like a large radio this entity proceeded to touch a button or a 
knob on it at which point The netting over the pen instantly retracted inside of this device 
Valentina grabbed a thick stick which she used for protection and she ran up to this little guy to 
stop him at this point he turned to her and threw this tubular device which flew towards her and cut 
her arm this device then returned to his hand like a boomerang now she tried to approach him 
and he threw this thing at her several times each time it would swing by her and cut her 
now these were very minor cuts but this instrument did prevent her from reaching the little man 
this figure then grabbed the radio device and he had a small plastic looking bag which he believed 
was filled with the Sheep entrails suddenly two tubes extended from the Bing's backpack and he 
rose up into the air and promptly disappeared after he was gone Valentina inspected her sheep 
pen and she saw that 34 of her sheep had been killed so this did create quite a sensation 
in the local community researcher J.J Benitez heard about the incident he arrived on the scene 
interviewed Valentina and conducted a thorough investigation he even talked to the neighbors 
Valentina was considered an honest and sincere individual although not educated it was clear to 
Benitez that the injuries from the sh that the Sheep had were clearly not done by predators 
so it's a really unusual case this was published in the Flying Saucer review 
and yeah a very unique case now it does seem clear in that case that this was an E.T 
given its appearance and how it floated around and although it did sort of respond hostily to 
the witness she did was throwing rocks at it so perhaps it was defending itself though that's not 
really an excuse for the way it came after her sheep it is what it is it's a you know a unique 
case I don't know of any others quite like it so I think you might want to consider that 
so I don't know it's an interesting case and here's another one which is really quite 
brief but it fits in perfectly with this theme tonight and I call this one goat kidnapped by ETS 
and this one took place in Via Alta Gracia in the Dominican Republic this next case 
occurred on September 22nd to 1972 as I said in Via Alta Gracia in the Dominican Republic 
this is somewhat near Cuba this case was investigated by Sebastian robiu la marshe 
and yeah briefcase involves a Local Peasant woman who reported seeing two short beings 
get out of a strange device covered with lights a UFO and grabbed a goat that seemed 
to be paralyzed she watched as these two short beings carried the goat into the UFO which 
took off at great speed until disappearing from sight so yeah a goat kidnapped by ETS 
so yeah that is a briefcase but it fits right in here so that's why I wanted to include it 
and these things are apparently happening lots of cases where ETS come down at and are certainly interested in or are collecting animals and here's another one 
I call this one can we have four of your rabbits this is a really interesting case probably one 
of my favorite of this little compilation and this one occurred in Santiago Chile 
and it's really a friendly encounter with human looking ETS who as we shall see were apparently on 
an exploratory Mission trying to collect animals from Earth this case occurred on August 17 1977 
into this specific area of Alto jahuel this is about 45 kilometers south of Santiago Chile the 
main witness is Marco Antonio de la cuadra he's 70 years old a farmer it was around 9pm on August 17 
and he was in his home and heard this buzzing sound coming from the far low end of his property 
uh this is where he kept a hutch of rabbits so he went outside to investigate and walked up to this 
rabbit hutch and saw a large oval object that he described as being about his biggest quote a small 
building and standing in front of this sort of oval-shaped object was a very tall human looking 
figure with blonde hair and he was wearing what the witness described as a tight-fitting kind of 
white diver's suit now this man communicated in a way that Marco Antonio felt was difficult to 
describe probably telepathically but this being said that he was looking for animals and that he 
was part of the scientific exploratory research group that was gathering species of animals and 
he said specifically they were looking to collect fish to populate the Waters of their planet 
which had no more fish which were basically dead according to Marco Antonio this man was 
very friendly very cordial uh Marco Antonio had no fear and he told this apparent E.T 
that sorry he had no fish but he did have rabbits and the entity asked for some rabbits 
now Marco didn't hesitate he obliged and brought the man four rabbits for irmine rabbits two male 
and two female in a cage at this point the man instructed the witness to put the cage 
on the ground and then to turn around and not look back until the buzzing sound ended 
now this is what Marco Antonio did he set the cage down turned around at which point 
a buzzing sound swept over him as well as a strong mist and an intense bright light 
that all went away very quickly afterwards Marco turned around and the cage was empty 
so yeah it's a pretty interesting case it created quite a bit of attention in Santiago Chile 
and as you can see the witness did give interviews it's a really interesting 
case as you can see a truly interesting case the witness wasn't frightened at all 
he told the ETS no I don't have any fish but I do have rabbits to offer you and they absolutely 
wanted the rabbits it's a pretty interesting case and here is another one which I call 
they were interested in the chickens I like this case because it has four Witnesses independent 
of each other two groups of two witnesses this occurred in Rio Piedras Puerto Rico 
and it has a lot of verification in terms of two sets of witnesses and physical evidence as well 
I also like it because this encounter lasted quite a long time and it's just really bizarre this next 
case occurred on March 3rd 1980 and it was about 3 30 a.m when 16 year old Vivian Cruz Rodriguez 
was woken up in her home at 148 interior Calle Canalis in buen consejo this is a suburb of Rio 
Piedras in Puerto Rico and she woke up because they're two chihuahuas were barking frantically 
and she heard someone on the porch moving stuff around on their outside the patio 
so Vivian looked out the window and saw five short beings and they were weird looking she 
said they had gray skin large eyes big pointed ears what appeared to be webbed 
hands and feet so this might be part of what they were wearing and they were wearing dark 
brown full body jumpsuits which covered pretty much everything except their faces 
now two of these beings were five feet tall and the other three were about three feet tall 
so seeing these beings Vivian immediately woke up her 12 year old brother Jose and the two of 
them looked out the window and watched these figures moving around the porch as if searching 
for something now they wanted to wake up their parents but as it turned out their parents slept 
in a room that was a cross on the other side of the patio which would have forced Vivian and Jose 
to basically go outside and cross the patio to get them so they couldn't wake up their parents 
and they just continued to watch and I'll just quote Vivian directly in her own words as she says 
we got a good view of the face of one of the little ones when he seemed to perceive that we 
were watching them and he looked straight at us his face was gray and elongated with a pointed 
chin his head was pear-shaped with big eyes and big eyelids and his eyes were shining as a dog's 
eyes do in the dark as regards to the nose and mouth I didn't go to get a good idea of them as 
my attention was taken up so much by his shining eyes he was wearing a helmet as all of them were 
and in his case the helmet had a sort of Center Crest on the top of it the hands of all five were 
identical and so were their feet all looking like duck's feet none of the five beings were walking 
they seemed to move around by little jumps as though they were floating over the ground 
so both Vivian and Jose had the impression that the two five foot tall beings were ordering the 
three smaller beings around now they didn't hear any voices but the entities seemed to communicate 
perhaps by telepathy or hand gestures because they were gesticulating and Vivian also noticed 
another weird detail these beings seem to be moving in a weird kind of slow motion fashion 
so Jose verifies all of this and as he says in his own words they certainly seem to be looking 
for something out there in the patio they seem to be very interested in the chickens too most of 
the time they kept shaking the pens and at times they appeared closely and fixedly at the chickens 
it was something to do with the chickens that's for sure one thing that surprised 
me very much was that although the dogs have been doing a lot of barking neither the hens 
nor the goat near the fowl's pens seemed to be the slightest bit affected by what was going on 
they were all calm and quiet even though the beings kept touching and shaking the pens 
now as they watched and this went on for quite a while one of the beings showed particular 
interest in an old discarded car mirror on the patio and this being actually picked this mirror 
up and examined it for several minutes before finally putting it down Vivian said that one of 
the beings scooped up water from a little tub that the next door neighbor used for his ducks 
so this went on for nearly a half an hour and suddenly all the animals seemed to become sleepy 
the the little Chihuahuas were no longer barking they returned to bed Jose himself says he became 
overwhelmed by this feeling of drowsiness and sleepiness to the point where he just couldn't 
stay awake and what's really interesting is later investigators questioned the parents 
who said that they had in fact woken up hearing The Barking of the Chihuahuas and the commotion 
on the patio and they both tried to get up but felt such a strong wave of drowsiness sweep 
over them that they were totally unable to get out of bed so that does seem to be a peculiar 
physiological effect perhaps the ETS were you know sort of imposing this on the witnesses but at this 
point a car began to approach and the beings seem to become alarmed by it and quickly fled the area 
heading towards the nearby Road Avenida 65 in fonteria in the morning they did find some 
physical evidence they found the silhouette of one of the being's hands on a piece of zinc sheeting 
and where the beings had been standing they saw damp patches of some strange liquid 
though it did evaporate so they didn't see any UFO but it turned out that there were other Witnesses 
Luciano Rivera age 47 lived nearby at number 433 Caye 21 
this is at the hill Brothers Precinct at sabana Yan this is a suburb of the same town Rio Piedras 
Luciano and a friend had gone to a bar that evening they had a few drinks and after enjoying 
the evening returned home they insist that at this point they were no longer intoxicated 
uh but they were tired and they were resting in their car in front of their home when Luciano 
woke up to see a strange object about 36 feet away he said it was 25 feet wide and 
about 10 feet thick or high and I'll just quote Luciano directly as he says it was shaped like 
a flying saucer and was lit up it had three metallic supports on which it was standing 
it had a big metallic Coppola with a number of Windows emitting a deep orange colored light 
the Coppola was silver colored like aluminum and from the top of the Coppola an antenna projected shooting beams of white light in various directions 
the projecting center part of the craft was pale yellow and seemed to be lit up there 
was an opening from which a small metallic ladder ran down to the ground when I saw that I woke my 
friend up and when he saw it he got very scared when I started up the car and switched on the 
lights we saw five strange figures moving slowly on the slope of the nearby piece of property 
so this matches so far what the other Witnesses reported at least in terms of there being five 
figures and Luciano described these beings very much in the same details as the Rodriguez siblings 
but Luciano did add that these figures were wearing belts and had what appeared 
to be little medallions on their chests which were emitting flashes of red and blue light 
he got a good look at their faces and did see that they had large nostrils and thick 
lips and he had the impression that one of these taller beings was female and the other was male 
now one of them was carrying a shining metallic sphere in his hand that's interesting because 
that does turn up in a lot of these E.T cases but they watched in shock as these five beings floated 
over a chain link fence back to the craft and entered it by climbing the ladder this point the 
object rose up the landing legs retracted and the craft moved off in a wobbling pendulum like motion 
now investigator Jorge Martine did investigate this case he's a very well-known investigator 
and he did learn that there were several other Witnesses in the nearby Town who had seen a 
UFO on that night in that area so that's good confirmation I think you'll agree that was a 
truly interesting case Puerto Rico has an awful lot of UFO activity reaching back many decades 
so I guess it shouldn't be surprising that there's a case involving et's interested in 
chickens though there's no evidence that they actually took any chickens despite the title of 
the article or one of the Articles saying that these were chicken poaching aliens there is no 
mention of missing chickens in the actual report so take that for what you will but wow what a case 
and here's another one this one is quite bizarre I call it I saw a dolphin on a UFO 
I like this case because it is unique though I have to tell you I did once interview a lady 
uh who said that she was taken on board and did see dolphins on board a UFO 
so perhaps not as unique as you might think this one took place in Manchester England and 
as we shall see this witness saws dolphins on board a UFO so this case occurred in January of 
1981 as I said in Manchester England and this was investigated by well-respected researcher 
Jenny Randalls we don't know the name of the witness she's anonymous but she was returning 
home with her mother on the highway when suddenly they noticed that there was no traffic everything 
was very strangely quiet and this is when they noticed this huge light started pacing their car 
and they tried to accelerate but their car would not accelerate and in fact it slowed down 
and things became even more strange because suddenly a very peculiar quote old-fashioned 
car appeared ahead of them very close to their own car and they became momentarily distracted 
by this and looked away from the light and when they looked back at the view of call it 
had transformed itself into what looked like a typical Flying Saucer a metallic disc that was 
hovering above the main road or at least that was their impression there was no old car there now 
and they finally reached home feeling quite nauseous the witness and she noticed at this point 
that her coat was missing and that's when she also noticed that she was missing two hours of time 
so after researching all of this they decided she decided to undergo hypnotic regression 
and all she was able to remember was being in a large clean kind of white room inside this room 
there was a very tall human looking man with blonde hair he was wearing a white sort of 
jumpsuit I had blue eyes and at some point he took her to a large enclosed pool area where she saw 
an ill dolphin a sick dolphin and here's where it's so interesting because this very tall man 
with blonde hair and blue eyes asked her to touch the dolphin so I don't know what the reason for 
that is perhaps this was all about helping to heal the dolphin or something I'm purely speculating I 
don't know but it's a very interesting case where someone saw a dolphin on board a UFO there you go 
dolphins on board a UFO I suspect there's a lot more cases like these but would you tell anyone 
if you saw an animal on board a UFO I don't know I hope so but I suspect that a lot of people don't 
and here's the final case I'd like to report today I call this one Pig snatching aliens 
and this one is really quite well verified in that the breeze family all saw activity 
most of them at least as well as neighbors this does involve physical evidence of various kinds 
Landing traces and more as we shall see it does have some pretty I guess you might say 
uh hostile elements while at the same time the ETS were saying do not be afraid we mean no harm 
however as we shall see since the witness did attack them shooting at them uh well 
the ETS did react so let's just get to this case because wow it is different this one's a doozy 
this occurred on September 12 2006 not that long ago in a very small town of tapin North Dakota 
and this involves the breeze family was early in the morning before Sunrise when 16 year old Evan 
Breeze got up to get a glass of water and he saw something moving around in the Corral where they 
keep their pet pigs and he first thought this might be a coyote which wouldn't be unusual so 
he grabbed a rifle and went into the Corral now this is again Before Sunrise the only source of 
light is the Moon so it's quite dark and entering the Corral he sought to bipedal figures they were 
very tall eight to nine feet tall they were doing something to one of the hogs in fact 
he saw one of these figures lift up the hog with one arm and basically toss it to the other figure 
this scared Evan quite badly it was a real shock so he basically acted very 
quickly and fired his rifle right at one of the creatures at which point it emitted a loud scream 
he felt a strong wave of fear coming from these figures and he heard a telepathic message from 
them saying we mean you no harm now despite this the these beings these uh figures did react one of 
the creatures floated very quickly towards Evan and basically he says threw him to the ground 
Evan landed on his back and blacked out he woke up a short time later at this point 
he saw that there are 450 pounds sow Ruthie who had been about to give birth was missing 
also Evan's shirt was torn up as you can see so he ran inside he called his sister trisra 
who called their parents their parents called the police and together they investigated the scene 
and it was just a few days later ufologist Richard Moss used hypnosis on Evan 
who under hypnosis said that he actually saw five entities in the chorale 
who were dragging Ruthie from the stall when he surprised them 
so this wasn't a one-off actually there was a lot going on at this time to the breeze family because 
it turned out that five months earlier Evan was on the property walking with his dog buster 
when he saw a strange light on the ground this was some distance away going up to investigate 
he saw that it was in fact a craft on the ground and it was emitting a beam of Light which appeared 
to be shining on one of their water holes he and his dog watch it for just a few seconds stunned 
at which point his dog Buster ran up to it and the craft immediately took off and it turned out that 
the boy's father Tory Breeze said that in July of that year he and his neighbors saw a strange blue 
light in the sky that they couldn't identify as he said we spent a half hour watching it 
so there were other events that were occurring at this time they did find a dead cow which died 
under mysterious circumstances though they can't connect it directly to any of this anyway it was a series of events which spread like wildfire through this very small town and 
was published in the local newspaper it was of the buzz of the town for quite a while 
pretty well investigated case and certainly very unusual so there you go those are eight cases each 
involving animals with some weird animal stories uh yeah you know there's a lot of these kinds of 
cases but these as we see come from all over the world many involving multiple Witnesses 
reaching back decades all the way up to very much current times and all kinds of physical 
evidence different types of ETS each providing some interesting insights into how not only 
ETS behave but how we react to them so there's always new stuff to learn from UFO encounters it's 
one of the reasons why I love doing this research really want to thank you for watching this unusual 
episode today I hope you enjoyed it found it interesting and maybe even learned something but 
until next time keep searching for the truth keep asking questions most important keep having fun.
