ET CONTACT: TEN HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Mar 29, 2024

Summary:
Mar 29, 2024
With so many people stepping forward to share their experiences of extraterrestrial contact, it’s clear that these encounters are far more common than previously believed. It’s difficult to say exactly how common contact is, but some researchers believe it numbers in the millions. This video presents ten cases of contact with humanoid ETs of various kinds, coming from all over the world, from the 1930s through the 1990s. Most of these cases involve extensive interactions with the ETs, including conversations. And of course, physical evidence of many kinds. As these cases show, ET contact is very real.

IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS. One night in 1938, Malcolm B Perry was walking to his home in Somerville, Massachusetts when an odd airborne object caught his eye. It was blimp-shaped with several portholes. Looking down at him through one of the portholes was a humanoid. Malcolm was overcome with a feeling of friendship, and as the craft zoomed off, a sense of loss swept over him.

DON’T LOOK UP! It was a hot day in summer of 1967 as a 16-year-old boy and his brother played outside their home in Langley Prairie, British Columbia, Canada. Without warning, a dome-shaped craft landed nearby and praying mantis ETs emerged. One of the figures approached the witness, speaking telepathically with him. After the beings left, both witnesses were affected both physically and emotionally.

ALL LIFE IS ONE. On May 10, 1957, Shirley McBride drove near Lake Isabella in southern California. Feeling a sudden urge to pull over and admire the scenery, she was fascinated to see a small glowing sphere approach. Moments later, it landed next to her. Inside she saw two humanoids who began to communicate telepathically. Afterward, she forgot the encounter, but later recalled it hypnotically.

THE CURIOUS ALIEN. On August 25, 1958, Mr. Neumann sat in a vacation cabin in Harja, Sweden, reading a book when a feeling of being watched overcame him. Looking at the window, he saw a short humanoid staring at him. Rushing outside to investigate, he chased the figure to a saucer-shaped craft which had landed in a nearby field. The craft took off, leaving behind landing traces.

ALIENS ON ROUTE 7. At 10pm on October 21, 1967, four teenage boys driving along Route 7 in Duncan, Oklahoma were shocked to see three short humanoids floating along the highway in front of them. The figures quickly jumped into a ravine. The boys called the police who believed them but refused to investigate. The next day, the boys returned to the spot and found a strange footprint.

ANOTHER DAM UFO. On the night of December 6, 1978, Jesus Antunes Moreira was in the guardhouse at the Marimbondo Hydroelectric Dam in Frontiera, Brazil when a UFO appeared overhead, then landed on the dam a short distance away. Three human-looking ETs exited the craft and began to speak with Jesus. But when they began to take rocks from the dam area, Jesus protested and the ETs departed.

TRUCKER ENCOUNTER. Just before midnight on December 15, 1978, truckdriver Angelo Capuzzello was driving along Highway 514 near Licodia, Sicily when his radio failed. Pulling over, Angela saw a glowing object just off the road. Shortly later, two humanoids approached and began to converse with him in a strange language. They quickly departed, but afterwards, their footprints could be seen.

DON’T BE SCARED. It was 6:30 pm on August 8, 1951 as RK walked along a path by the resort town of Chalupy, Poland. His walk was interrupted when two weird figures approached. They had large eyes, a slit for a mouth, and wore green jumpsuits. Moments later, he saw a silver disc a short distance away. The beings spoke with RK, and the next thing he knew, 15 minutes had elapsed. He had missing time.

ALIENS AT THE URANIUM FACTORY. On December 12, 1987, retired restauranteur Gerard Lamy went to collect wood near his home in Narbonne France, right next to the Malesi Uranium Factory. To his shock, six child-like figures with Asian eyes and brown skin appeared. They wore dark jumpsuits and stood next to strange-looking scooters. Gerard realized they were actually ETs. The beings then boarded their scooters which levitated off the ground and carried them away.

I WAS PETRIFIED WITH FRIGHT. At 3am on August 31, 1990, Miguel Figueroa drove near Lake Cartagena, Puerto Rico when he came upon a group of people along the highway. They said strange creature were blocking the road ahead. Miguel went to investigate and came upon four gray-skinned figures with large heads and huge eyes. He followed them until they left the road. After the encounter, Miguel was threatened not to speak about his encounter.

These ten cases are just a brief glimpse into the huge number of encounters that have been taking place across the planet. How many cases will it take before our governments disclose the truth and the world recognizes that we are not the only people in this universe?

Mar 29, 2024
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal today's episode is called ET contact 10 humanoid encounters I've
chosen 10 cases from all over the world that includes Canada across the United
States one case from Brazil several from Europe including Sweden Poland Italy and
France a case also from Puerto Rico so quite a widespread geographical area
which is important I think this gives us a more accurate representation of what's going on I've also chosen cases from
across a wide period of time reaching all the way back to the 1930s and covering Each decade up to the
1990s so this also provides some information of how ET contact has sort
of evolved over the decades and these cas each single one involves humanoids and what I like about
this particular episode is a lot of these cases are quite extensive involving pretty extensive interactions
with ETS and by that I mean actual conversations in quite a few of these cases and of course we see all kinds of
evidence of physiological effects and Landing traces and weird electromagnetic
effects and so forth so yeah these cases have a lot to teach teach us about
what's out there beyond Earth and of course about ourselves so this is going to be an
hourong episode I'm estimating let's just get started and the first case I'd
like to talk about today I call it seemed like they were old friends and
this is how a lot of witnesses feel when they have encounters with ETS that's
certainly true in this very early case which occurred in 1938 in Somerville Massachusetts it's a
really interesting encounter ET sightings prior to the Modern Age of UFOs in
1947 are really quite rare but here is a case which comes from the files of Jim
and coral Lorenzen of the aerial phenomena research organization Appo the
main witness is Malcolm B Perry and it took him about 24 years to report his
sighting of a UFO and a humanoid which he only did after attending a lecture by
the lorenzin and hearing about other people who have had similar experiences
and he ended up writing a quite lengthy letter about what he saw and here's his story was
1938 and Malcolm had just walked his girlfriend to her home in Somerville
Massachusetts it was around midnight the moon was out it had rained recently there were a few clouds in the sky but
it was mostly clear and Malcolm was walking down the street back to his home
this is when movement in the Eastern Sky caught his eye and he saw what he at first thought might be a Navy blimp and
he wondered immediately what a blimp would be doing cruising around over Somerville at that late hour so he took
a closer look and was surprised to see of course it wasn't a blimp as Malon
says I could see several Port holes or openings on the side
and I kept looking for a gondola or a propeller or something to make it move but could see nothing in fact no noise
was coming from it at this time so clearly not a blimp Malcolm then
realized at this point he was seeing something very strange and soon he noticed a humanoid
as Malcolm says my attention now became riveted to one of the openings where I
could see a person apparently sitting and he in turn seemed to be watching me
at this point I had a very strong urge to wave with all my might I looked up
and down the street to see if anyone else was observing the object but no one was in sight looking back again at the
ship I could see also people moving around as if taking turns looking out of
the other openings I still had an almost irresistible urge to wave with all my
strength as it seemed like they were old friends at this point the object moved
behind some clouds and that was the last I saw of it so now that the object was gone
Malcolm's reaction really surprised him as he says I immediately Had A peculiar
lost or let down feeling the next morning I looked in the paper for news of a strange Airship or something of
that nature but I saw nothing now it's entirely possible someone else saw it
but didn't report it certainly Malcolm didn't and it's too bad he didn't wave
back because maybe that would have made an more extensive encounter but apparently this other humanoid did see
him the sighting was brief but it totally changed Malcolm's view of the world for the rest of his life as
Malcolm says I am convinced that there are people from other planets that are living with us and visiting us
constantly for thousands of years and that their purpose is to preserve peace
and improve our way of life without antagonizing and if they were not afraid
of us would make themselves known in ever increasing numbers now unknown to
Malcolm at the time certainly there would be many other sightings over Somerville throughout the decades and of
course all over the world so he was right in his prediction that they would make themselves known in ever increasing
numbers because that's exactly what happened such a shame that this witness didn't
get to go on board sounds like these were pretty friendly ETS he certainly
had that impression and it is a brief encounter though there was interaction there didn't get to see the ETS very
close up so it's hard to say what they looked like but boy this next case wow
this one is amazing I found it really emotionally touching actually I call
this one don't look up this occur in 1947 right at the dawn of the Modern Age
of UFOs near Langley this is in British Columbia Canada and this one involves
the praying mantis type ETS and yes there's some very extensive interactions
with this one and it's a very unusual case for sure this case comes from
well-respected and pioneering researcher Graham Conway of the UFO British
Columbia UFO group ufob BC and it involves a witness who has insisted upon
absolute anonymity in fact he only came forward to share his encounter many many
years after it happened it affected him quite profoundly as he says some of the
terror has lessened and although it has been blanked out of my life I would have flashbacks and relive it so yeah this
really affected him and here's what happened it was a hot day in the spring or summer of
1947 the witness was 16 years old at the time he lived with his brother and
mother on the border of Cloverdale and Langley this is in British Columbia Canada along what would be called the
TransCanada Highway at this time it was a very rural area with very few homes
lots of trees and flat Farmland now the witness and his younger brother were outside playing in the
creek that ran by their home his younger brother was actually in the creek catching minnows while the witness sat
under a nearby tree reading a book and as the witness says it was very quiet I
had heard a hum but I thought nothing of it the next I knew a silver gray and
what I know of today was a UFO sat down right in front of
me so this affected him in a very weird way the witness says he fell into what
he calls a quote blank State he kind of kept slipping in and out of
Consciousness and this went on for some time he estimates about an hour but he's really not sure but he certainly did see
what happened next as he says in his own words a door opened I believe from
bottom to top and out walked four or five grotesque creatures looking like
praying mantis wearing dull silver gray body fitted coverings no buttons zippers
Nothing by this time I had stood up and I still held my book one creature came
right to me and stood looking at me took my book and looked at it it put its
hands on my shoulder it could read my thoughts everything I thought of it knew
it was so terrifying it looked into my eyes deeply and I'm certain I could hear
the black eyes click just like a camera now when this happened he
suddenly felt this weird wave of calmness from behind him he heard his mother shouting at him
frantically and he told her to get away telling her that she might get shot if she didn't go back into the house which
she did now the witness then had the distinct impression that quote they were
here due to the wars and bombs end quote at this point the creature left the
witness and rejoined the others all of who began to walk around the UFO
inspecting it and the witness had the impression that there was a problem with the front door area he feels quite sure
about this and that they were trying to fix it he did notice that there were
many cars passing along the highway pretty much in full view of the object and he thought to himself the silly
fools meaning the ETS don't they realize someone driving by will be able to see
them and the large
ing after the craft he decided at this point that other people must have seen the craft otherwise why would the planes
be there but as he watched the UFO quickly outdistanced the Jets darting
off to the south towards Washington State now once it had left he called out
to his little brother who appeared to be in a trance just standing there in the creek as the witness says he did not
move I had to step into the creek take him by the hand call his name and said
we will go home now so the two boys went inside and this
is when they discovered that their mother was quite angry that they had stayed out so long the witness and his
brother reported at this point that they had an unquenchable thirst and could not
drink enough water the witness then went directly to bed he says that upon
awaking he found that his skin was bright red painful aspirin he said did
little to leave the pain and this affected him for days if not weeks he
remained pretty much in bed for a few weeks finally after he was able to get
up and walk around he looked outside of the house and he did discover evidence
that a craft had in fact landed where he saw it as he says I could see from the
kitchen window a large circle of burnt or black grass 3 months later we moved
away I have never never spoken to anyone about this and find it very hard to
write about I started a journal a few years ago and could not finish it now
the witness said that he had to condense this story which he wrote in a letter to Graham Conway and that there were quite
a few more details to it thanks again to Graham Conway for bringing this case to
us I do wish the witness had provided the full story cuz you know apparently
there's more to it and I really wonder about that it's just so interesting because it's such an early encounter and
there we see once again all the way back then even ETS apparently warning people
about war and aggression and this sort of thing so that I found a very
interesting detail to this account also its physiological reactions were kind of
interesting perhaps he was exposed to radiation from the craft hard to say for sure but definitely an interesting case
and I think so is this next one which I call all life is
one this is just one of apparently several incidents that this witness had
it is a single witness case but it was professionally investigated it occurred on May 10
1957 near Lake Isabella this is in Southern California I like this case
because I know this area very well I've been there many times and it's just a
fascinating case with some very unusual details this case comes from researchers
Ann druffle and William McCall and the only witness is a lady by the name of
Shirley McBride it was daytime May 10 1957 and
Charley was driving along a deserted Dead End Road this is in Kar County very
near Lake Isabella California now Shirley who is described
by druffle as an intellectual with a deep interest in metaphysics she drove to the end of this
dirt road where she felt compelled to exit her car and just stand there and
enjoy the beautiful scenery and this is when she noticed a small glowing sphere
coming into view over the tops of some nearby trees and at first she says it
appeared quite small perhaps only a few inches in diameter but as it came close
this little sphere this bubble expanded rapidly to an oval shape about 6 feet
wide and 9 ft High glowing with white Radiance as you can see here and behind
the glow Shirley said she could see two shadowy figures which she believed were
intelligent living entities but because she got a message from them it was
telepathic and these apparent ETS said quote do not be afraid
now this was interesting because Shirley was not feeling any fear she was only fascinated and really quite excited she
had had previous encounters and as she watched this object came right down to the ground floating just above it and
was really only a few feet away from her she got a really good look at this object now and she could see what looked
like quote fins all made of light protruding about 4 to 6 in from the
surface of the object object she didn't notice that it was totally silent and
she watched this thing for a few minutes she had a strange feeling that she was somehow intruding on it so suddenly she
returned to her car and began to drive away and in fact the object was still
there as she drove off now here's where it gets weird upon leaving the area she
completely forgot about this encounter had no memory of it whatsoever however later after having
experienced other encounters she did decide to go under hypnosis and it was
while under hypnotic regression by William McCall she returned to this
incident and she recalled that the entities inside the bubble did in fact communicate with her but strangely she
refused to reveal what the ETS said and I'll just quote an druffle the
researcher here as an says the transcript of of the tape recorded
hypnotic session is heart-rending and almost frightening it shows deep stress
as M McBride sought to keep parts of the contract secret shared by the ETS and
which promised them that she would not reveal it was only the expert skill of
Dr McCall that allowed us to gather the facts as clearly as we did she staunchly
resisted this suggestion that she should reveal the secret even when the
hypnotist reminded her that her loyalty belonged to the human race not the
aliens the word aliens as applied to the visitors in the bubble incensed her she
repeatedly contended under hypnosis that they were not alien but that quote it
was all the same now later after coming out of hypnosis she elaborated to the
researchers and said that in her opinion all life is one
this is interesting because this is a message a lot of contactees get we are you you are us we are one and that's
certainly true in her case I do wish we had more information in that case I'm particularly curious about what the
witness Shirley McBride withheld from researchers It's Not Unusual for people
contactees to feel a very close relationship with the ETS and not to
reveal everything that they said but I'm very curious about what the information
was and I guess we'll never know but thankfully there's always another case
to explore and here is a case that's probably my favorite in this little
collection just because it's so darn interesting and
unusual and I call this one the Curious alien this occurred on August 25 1958 in
the very small town of hara Sweden it's quite an unusual case of a
gentleman who has a face-to-face contact with an apparent extraterrestrial sees
the ship the whole deal and of course there are some interesting Landing traces as well this case involves a
gentleman by the name of Mr Newman he and his family were at a farm in harja
this is near vaster gotland Sweden they were on a holiday and had rented a
small cabin from a local farmer and it was late at night on August 25
1958 and Mr Newman was reading a book he got up to smoke a pipe and when he
looked out of the window he noticed a strange figure walking towards the ouse now he didn't think much of this at
first because he thought it might be the caretaker on the farm going to relieve himself so Mr Newman just lit his pipe
sat down and kept reading and this is when events became very strange and I'll
just let Mr Newman describe in his own words as he says immediately I got a
strong sense that someone was looking at me I turned around and stared straight
into a face half a meter away only the glass pain separated us at first of
course I thought it was a man I have always taken saucers and Aliens as pure
run my reaction was quite natural that it was the question of a but when
I looked closer I could tell that there was something peculiar about him the
face was framed by a kind of helmet which Shone with a cold bluish Sheen it
was the same with his clothes he wore only a coverall which was drawn to something that resembled a collar and
only now did I notice how small he really was like a boy around the age of
11 or 12 it was too dark for me to make out the color of the face but it was in
any case brighter than the helmet and overalls the eyes were slightly larger than a human's and they seemed to be
exactly black his look had an unexplicable effect it seemed it
hypnotized me so yeah he first thought this was a looking out the window
he saw it from only feet away realizing no this is not normal person too short
wearing strange clothes really big dark eyes so he surprised himself by actually
quickly throwing on a jacket and rushing out to meet this strange figure and soon
as he stepped outside he saw that this figure immediately left the window ran across the yard hopped the small fence
at the back of the house and continued to run for about 300 ft now very curious Mr Newman ran after
the figure and quickly caught sight of him standing next to a truck on the property not too far away so he
continued to approach the figure who now crossed the road back and forth a little bit and then moved to the right into a
field of wheat Mr Newman continued to approach and he reached the edge of the
field and he was shocked to see a large disc-shaped object sitting in the field
and he estimates it was about 36 ft in diameter it had a row of Port holes
around a top Dome section long Landing legs reaching down to the ground and a
ladder coming down to the ground from the center bottom section and he was pretty close to it he estimates it was
about 75 ft away and he could now smell a very strong odor of some kind now this
little being started to react to Mr Newman presence as Mr Newman says the
little one immediately ran up to the craft and climbed a staircase or ladder
which ran up the center of the craft at this point he heard a loud
electric motor sound but it sounded very musical in fact it almost reminded him
of Yiddish chanting now here I will just quote Mr
Newman again as he describes how this craft took off as he says
the craft took off slowly and at the same time the singing tone grew sharper
I knew then how I became completely paralyzed I absolutely could not move
the craft first pitched straight up as it retracted its telescoping legs
resembling an airplane falling into its landing gear then accelerated violently
some birch trees standing 10 to 15 M away bent in the blast after the craft
when it disappeared it had an incredible speed and then the paralysis also
loosened its grip on me all that left all that was left was a sharp smell of
ozone so at this point the witness went back to the cabin he immediately told his wife what happened she was skeptical
and told him he must have dreamt the whole experience it was already pretty late at this point so he went directly
to bed but the next morning he told the farmand a gentleman by the name of Oscar
what had happened Oscar was also skeptical but did reluctantly agree to
follow Mr Newman to the location of this encounter where this craft had landed
and there in fact they did find some evidence that something had landed there as Mr Newman says first we found that 10
to 12 CM of the plow axle was gone then
that the wheat acre was trampled and finally we found three deep marks which
formed a triangle so these are some pretty significant Landing traces but given that so many people
were skeptical or at least the two he told Mr Newman decided to keep quiet about his encounter and told no one for
the next 14 years however by the mid 1970s many other people were reporting
UFOs so he decided to come forward and share his experience with UFO
researchers and today he remains absolutely convinced that he encountered
an extraterrestrial and its craft I can't blame the witness for not talking about his experience for over a decade
uh again most people don't talk about it at all so kudos to anyone who has the courage to step forth and share their
story with investigators just goes to show that this this is probably a lot more common
than any estimates we have very hard to say but certainly seems that these
encounters are occurring all over the world and have been for a very very long
time I like that case because it's an interesting case of a human looking ET
as well that seems to be the most common if you take into account
worldwide perhaps Grays it's close but uh yeah so many interesting different types of
humanoids for sure and here's another one that speaks to that this next case I
call aliens on Route 7 this occurred on October 21st
1967 in what was then a pretty small town Duncan Oklahoma I like this case
because it does have multiple Witnesses four Witnesses who got a pretty close up
view of some very unusual looking ETS and while it was a very brief encounter
it was not a one-off event cuz there was apparently some aftermath to this it's
an interesting case here is another case from Jim and coral Lorenzen of AO who
apparently heard about it from newspaper reports and this one involves four teenage boys including Ivan Ritter Jerry
Bennett and two others it was around 1 p.m. on October 21st 196 67 and the four
boys were driving east on State Route 7 pictured here again in Duncan
Oklahoma they were just east of their Hometown and this is when movement on
the highway ahead of them caught their attention they had their dim headlights on so they flicked the car headlight
beams onto high beam and this is when they saw three tiny men in the
headlights each were about 4 ft tall wearing skintight shiny blue green
clothing or perhaps that was their skin color the witnesses weren't entirely sure but they did say the figures looked
mostly human or humanoid but had very large ears now the figures reacted
immediately being struck by these headlights and as the boys said they quote almost flew off the road and
disappeared now this was puzzling because at this location there was a steep foot drop off on the side of the
highway now the boys did go straight to the local Duncan police department and
made a report to officers Elmer Mcgill and pleasant Foster both the officers were very much
impressed by the boy's sincerity in fact as officer McGill says they were really
scared and I think they must have seen something now the next morning Ivan rter
and Jerry Bennett two of the teenagers did drive back to the location to search for evidence and in verification of
their sighting they did find what appeared to be a strange footprint this was about 300 ft from the road in the
bottom of this little muddy creek bed where they had seen these creatures dive
down to this footprint was they said about as small as a baby's foot but had
a very large heel an overly wide Arch and four toes so clearly not a human
footprint and while the police did take the boy's report seriously they did not do any type of official
investigation so the boys were on their own and to their respect they and their
friends continued to patrol the area and it was the next Tuesday some of their
friends said that they were at the same location at night and they observed a strange green light in the woods
and when they shown their flashlight at it this light went off and then reappeared several hundred yards away
they were very much perplexed by this but a little bit too wary to pursue the
light so that's where this case unfortunately ends it's a shame these
cases aren't investigated with more seriousness while the police did interview the witnesses and took the
reports seriously and thought the case was genuine they really weren't that
interested in investigating it beyond that and I'm glad the kids took their own initiative to try and figure out
what was going on and did have another encounter but unfortunately became too
frightened to pursue that light in the forest so I guess we'll never know but it could have turned into a much more
extensive encounter now moving along to the next case I call this one another Dam UFO
when I say Dam I mean d a hydro electric Dam as you may know I did a previous
episode on encounters over dams and hydroelectric stations and here's
another one that slipped by me so I found this case of particular interest
because UFOs do seem to show a strong interest in hydroelectric dams and
that's undeniably true in this case which involves face-to-face contact a
landed UFO and some pretty extensive interactions this one occurred on
December 6th 1978 at the marim Bondo hydroelectric
plant this is in Frontera Brazil it's a pretty well authenticated case and has
some very interesting aspects to it and again I know I already said this but
this is another one of my favorite in this collection because it's just really
unusual and interesting interesting This truly amazing UFO ENC Conor was
researched by Leading Brazilian investigator Dr Walter K buer and the
main witness in this case is a gentleman by the name of Jesus Antunez
morera at the time of his encounter he was working as a Watchman for the marando hydroelectric plant in frona
Brazil was just after 8:30 p.m. on December 6th 1978
and because it was raining Jesus was up in the guardhouse located on top of the dam itself and I'll just let Jesus
describe what happened next as he says I was anxious to keep dry suddenly I
noticed that something was lighting up the surface of the water in the dam my curiosity aroused I stepped out of the
guardhouse and went to see what it could be and found myself looking at an object which was slightly above the level of
the horizon about 200 M from me and crossing the Rio Grand was coming in my direction and
when it got closer I could make out that it was a spacecraft about 5 m wide and 3
m high white in color and emitting a certain amount of
Luminosity it looked as though it was about to land on top of the dam maybe
right by the PowerHouse so this was clearly not a plane Jesus thought thought for a brief
moment it might be a new kind of helicopter as helicopters were often used to inspect the dam but he noed
immediately that this object wasn't making any noise at all it didn't have propellers so he knew it wasn't a
helicopter and in fact as he got a good look at it he could see that this was something very strange and again as
Jesus says in his own words getting more and more Curious I started walking along
on the top of the concreted part of the dam but the craft went past where I was then
moved to the earn part of the dam about 1 and 1/2 M from the foot of it I was
now able to see that its color was not white but a light gray it had a door
about 2 m high with a little window in the upper part of it and it had a sort of platform running right around it so
Hosea approached until he was only about 21 ft from it at this point the window
appeared to open and he saw this face looking out which he says looked quote
in many respects very like a human face but events were about to go from strange
to really bizarre because as Jesus says then the main door opened and from
it came three beings dressed in blue coveralls with a metallic Sheen they
were all very tall 2 m maybe and with quite long black Smooth hair in an
absolutely natural sort of fashion they spoke to me in some unknown
language now Jesus was unable to understand what they were saying and still thinking that they might be or
must be foreigners from another country on Earth Jesus said I will go and get
somebody who can speak your language and told him that there were phones there and he was going to go to one of the
phones now now at this point one of the figures gestured for Jesus to step back
that was his impression and at this point Jesus started to realize that these were not normal people and he
reached for the revolver which he carried for his job and he planned to fire a warning shot at them and in fact
tried to do so but when he did the gun jammed and as H says at that point one
of them went inside the machine and came out with a Black Box about the size of a shoe box and handed it to one of the
others who was the one that had the longest hair I noticed that all of them were wearing rosec colored gloves which
were luminous like their blue overalls from then on I was able to understand
perfect what they were saying to me so the beings at this point began to speak
in Jesus's native language of Portuguese and they asked him are you scared keep
calm we have no intention of doing you any harm Jesus asked what do you want
where do you come from they replied we are on a research and study Mission if
you remain calm you will soon know all about it now unfortunately this did not
happen because as Jesus says my meeting with them was broken off
when one of them using a rope with a grab at the end of it started extracting
some stones from the place whereupon I objected that was enough for them to put
away the box and without the slightest show of dissatisfaction or displeasure
reenter their craft so they were apparently starting to take some of the Rocks away from the base of the dam
which is dangerous after the encounter Jesus did inform his superiors and he was
immediately sent to see the company doctor Dr Sergio Bandera who could see that Jesus was
suffering from powerful attacks of nausea he was quite dazed he suffered
from light sensitivity for over an hour and he only recovered from all of this
very slowly and gradually but Jesus was absolutely
convinced he had an really unusual encounter as he told investigators yes
it is true I really did see a flying SAU and I talked with its crew it wasn't
long after this that Jesus quit his job at the marando dam and began to work as
a driver for a department store I think you'll agree that that was a fascinating
case it's undeniable that ETS are showing an interest in our technology
and cases like these of UFOs over dams I think show this very clearly find it
also interesting that the witness had not only physi iCal effects but decided
to quit his job after this that's not that unusual in fact there's an upcoming
case in this very episode where the same darn thing happened so this just goes to
show how profoundly an encounter can affect a person and now we move to another real
interesting encounter I call this one trucker encounter this case is from Italy
actually it occurred on December 15 19 78 in lodia this is in Sicily Italy and
it's a really fascinating encounter involving electromagnetic effects
human-looking ETS or mostly human-looking a very very close-up
encounter and just a fascinating interaction with this trucker who had a
very close encounter this case comes from Italian researcher Moreno
tambellini who wrote about it in his book and it was just before midnight on
December 15 1978 that a truck driver by the name of
Angelo Capello he's 48 years old at the time he was driving his van along
Highway 514 this is near lodia yubia when his
radio suddenly and inexplicably stopped working now this is a narrow road there
aren't a lot of pulloff spots but he pulled off at the next emergency area to
repair His Radio and this is when he noticed a glowing cylindrical object had
landed nearby in a field and he said that the light was bright as quote latch
produced by an electric Arc so he's looking at this when suddenly the light
went out and immediately afterwards two tall strange looking figures suddenly
approached him from the direction of where he had seen this glowing object and they were walking in this weird slow
gate both he said were over 6 feet tall and dressed in blue black skintight
coveralls complete with gloves and boots both wore helmets with transparent face
plates which had weird antenna like devices on either side where the ears
would be and he could see through the face plates that they had what looked like human looking faces though at first
he didn't get a good look at them he immediately thought they might be burglar of some kind he quickly hid his
money but they stopped about 15 to 20 ft from the side of his truck at which
point two bright beams of light came from their helmets striking
Angelo at this point the two figures walked right up to the witness stopping he says only inches away from him and he
said that the light from their helmets was so bright he had to turn his head away or he wouldn't be able to see so as
they stood next to him he felt his body become quote emptied of energy so I
think this is the kind of paralysis people often report at any rate at this point the two
figures began to make strange gestures while speaking in a strange language
with a very deep voice that Angelo was not able to understand now he wondered
if they were asking him where they were so he told them on the Katan ruso
highway now at this point the beings turned to the side and this gave Angelo
a clear view into one of their face plates and he was amazed to see that the figure was actually quote a beautiful
young man it had a perfect face with no facial hair
whatsoever but at this point the two figures turned they walked slowly and
deliberately in the same direction that they had approached towards where this glowing object had been disappearing
into the darkness and it was just a few seconds later Angelo heard a loud humming noise this super bright arklight
light reappeared and the object suddenly took off vertically and he could now see
it was a saucer shaped object with a dome on top he estimates about 30 ft in
diameter was very bright on top with a diminishing illumination towards the
bottom but he said it lit up the road with this intense light as it moved off at very high speed immediately Angelo's
vehicle radio started working again and he also noticed a strong smell of sulfur
in the air he estimates that this whole encounter lasted about 6
minutes and he left the area but he did return with a friend the next day and
together they said they found many large strange Footprints where these two
figures had been there sure are a lot of cases of people driving along and
suddenly their car stalls or something happens and this is when they have an
encounter so that's a really interesting pattern I found this case so interesting
because he described these ETS as very much human looking very beautiful that is something that does come up quite a
bit there's also this weirdly puzzling interaction which seems so brief they
just come up almost as if to say hi and off they go on their merry way it's very
strange but certainly quite common and here's another case which I think shows
how profoundly emotional an encounter can be and I call this one don't be
scared this case occurred on August 8th 1981 in chalupy Poland it was researched
by a professional UFO investigator it does have apparently multiple Witnesses
though a single witness who saw the humanoids himself but again has this
very closeup interaction with very unusual humanoids I found it
particularly fascinating how they were dressed and the equipment they were carrying but as you'll see see I think
this case does have some interesting insights into the UFO phenomena and this
one does possibly involve missing time this case comes from polish researcher
Kristoff pichota and it involves a witness known only by his initials
RK it was about 6:30 p.m. again on August 8th 1951 as RK was returning from a walk on
the beach he was walking along a a pathway right next to the railway
heading towards his campsite this is in the small village of chupi this is a well-known tourist destination on the
hell Peninsula on the Baltic coast of Poland and this is when he suddenly saw
quote two guys in dark clothes and they quickly ran off into the bushes to the
right about 150 ft ahead of him he at first thought they might be boys but he
says they looked quite strange they were 5T tall very slender dressed only in
green and had large almond shaped eyes kind of greenish skin a very small slit
for a mouth with no visible lips and just a little bump for a nose even more strange there was this
strange foggy Mist which surrounded the center of their bodies from their abdomen to their hips though he could
see that they were wearing strange belts which carried all this very unusual looking black boxes covered with all
kinds of equipment like ribbons spiral wires and what looked like purple and
yellow cables and this is when he saw an apparent UFO craft as RK says at the
same time I noticed their vehicle quite far away from me on the right it was
silver I received through my brain a telepathic message that they were sending me don't be be scared I
understood that they had no hostile intentions now he describes this craft
as being sort of a flat oblong disc silver in color about 18 ft long 3 ft
high and he said it was hovering about 2 to 3 feet above the ground it was
completely smooth its surface had no markings no Port holes or protrusions of
any kind so RK is looking at this but he kept walking along the path and when he
reached the point where these figures had left the path he received another telepathic message which said quote go
through don't stop and it was at this exact point that he had a very strange
feeling of passing through some kind of sphere as he says it was Indescribable I
was constantly receiving messages directly so he couldn't really describe
what this was but he passed through something the witness kept walking and moments later he came upon a middle-aged
couple walking their dog and he asked them if they had seen anything strange
and they said no but this was weird because this couple had actually left the beach after him they had been
walking behind him on the path and now he's meeting them in front of him so if
there was something there they should have seen it there's no way they could be in front of him so something weird
happened here now later he did go to the spot where this he had seen this craft
and did find what looked like Landing traces strange markings they were in the
form of two ovals about 7 to 8 feet in diameter with four holes deeply
impressed into the ground so after going over the event with investigator
Christof pyot it did appear that the witness was unable to account for about 15 minutes
of time which would explain why the couple with the dog did not see anything
and suddenly went from being behind him to being in front of him but yeah they
did not report seeing any humanoids or craft nor did they see the witness RK
until he walked up to them later thankfully the witness the investigators
did locate another man who said that he was in the area at the time and did
observe a strange glowing pink object rising up from the ground exactly where
RK said he had seen this object I think there is a strong possibility there was missing time in this encounter given
that the gentleman was being followed by this couple and then suddenly they were in front of him he can't account for 15
minutes I'm glad that there was another witness who saw a UFO in the area because that always lends another level
of credibility to an encounter but certainly very interesting now this next case and I've
said this twice before already but I think this one is actually my favorite given where this one took place I call
this one aliens at the uranium Factory and the fact is this encounter took
place very very close to a uranium processing plant I think this is hugely
significant because we know as UFO researchers that UFOs show a very strong
interest in anything involving nuclear materials of any kind and I
think that's probably what was going on in this very interesting case which occurred on December 12
1987 just outside of narbon France it was just a few miles away from the micii
uranium Factory near narbone France that a 40-year-old man by the name of Gerard
Ley a musician and former restaurant tour had his incredible counter with a
group of ETS he had gone to this area just south
of the uranium plant and north of narbone to collect some wood to cook on
his grill and as Gerard says after having moved forward about 6 or 7 m i
discovered six people in front of me near Four machines similar to snow
scooters under their awkward gaze I momentarily abandoned my plan to collect
wood and I approached this strange group of individuals rather small of Asian
type who seemed to be Sheltering under a hedge of shrubs arriving nearby I didn't notice
anything strange apart from the Curious machines so to start the conversation I
tell them hello bad weather today now the beings responded by making
incomprehensible nasal sounds and this is when Gerard noticed that each of
these figures were quite short about 4 feet tall they had brown skin and
strange wrinkles near their nose but otherwise looked very much human kind of
reminding him of young children he did notice that they all wore identical dark
jumpsuits with tight fitting hoods except for two of them who had no hood
and he did notice that a few of them had a silvery white head covering or perhaps
this was thick silvery white hairir very close cut you couldn't tell for sure but
these little scooters were clearly not no normal he said that they were in off-white color about 4 feet long 1 and
1/2 ft wide but they had no visible controls no handlebars no wheels no
engines nothing so he's quite puzzled about this and he asked him are you from
the area well one of the figures who he perceived was female spoke two words
which at the time Gerard didn't understand though after going over it with other people he thought they might
have said English words actually saying planet Earth remember he speaks
French so at this point he's now wondering if somebody's playing a prank on him if there's a movie going on he
starts looking around for a hidden camera in a kind of joking way he says oh well you're
extraterrestrials he wasn't really being serious at this point but in response
one of the figures squatted down to the ground he says wrote two symbols in the
earth one of which he said looked like the Greek letter gamma the small form
and the other the letter c and then this figure said in the same nasal voice in
French Cel Deon which means sky or heaven and
Demon now this is very puzzling he's still thinking it's some kind of movie or prank and he jokingly asked them is
it better on your planet and the female replied in
French which means less work he pointed to the scooters and asked them how do
these machines work and the lady replied magnetic and then said the rain bothers
us no relay with Bas so apparently they were having some trouble communicating
with their Bas hard to to say but Gerard asked him at this point you are like us
is there air on your planet and it's just so strange because the female pointed to the symbols she
Drew on the ground and said what Gerard perceived to be 9th century and then
13th century and then one of the figures walked up to him and said Arctic pole
and held out its hand so this is just full of high strangeness but Gerard is
becoming increasingly curious and realizes these are not normal people and
he really felt this was true when he touched this being's hands and was
surprised to realize that its skin was quote particularly cold he wasn't sure
if this was the skin or the glove or whatever but it was around this time
that Gerard noticed that the others in the group were exchanging concerned glances among each other and he got the
distinct impression that they were not not happy about this interaction and Gerard being there at this point the
female figure said to jard we're not interested in you but some humans are
going with us so whatever that means hard to say but at this point one of the
figures approached and appeared to Gerard to be irritated or even angry and
he spoke out loud to the group in that same weird nasal incomprehensible ible
voice and immediately all of the figures jumped on their little
scooters and with no noise or any manipulation the machines lifted slightly off the ground and as Gerard
says they pivoted in place and headed to the right towards the top of the hill
the speed was low and they only gained altitude very slowly moving about 3 or 5
M from the ground suddenly I heard a sharp noise as if coming from inside my
head this resulted in a loss of consciousness but curiously I remained
standing so yeah these little scooters were levitating they took off he hears this loud sound inside of his head and
loses Consciousness and after a brief lapse of Consciousness he wakes up he's
still standing and the figures and their little machines are gone so this really
concerned Gerard and he fled the scene later that afternoon he shared what
happened with his family and he returned to the site with his daughter to the scene and they both saw four or five
round dark marks in the grass apparently where these little Vehicles had
rested now this case did appear in the French magazine lumier donu and the
whole case really quite puzzled the French investigators that has got to be one of the most unusual cases on on
record given what the ET said those little kind of scooters that they were
driving I mean there's just so many fascinating details to this case which
certainly puzzled the French investigators who looked into it but yeah a fascinating case which once again
shows ETS do apparently have an interest in anything nuclear I suspect that's
what was going on in that case hard to say for sure because the ETS didn't say anything about it but wow what an
interesting interaction that was and now we move to our last case of this little
collection this one took place in Puerto Rico I call it I was petrified with
fright this case is so interesting because it involves some interesting psychic aspects also multiple
Witnesses what are apparently very close at least to gray ETS took place in a
very interesting location as well this one occurred on August 31st
1990 in Lake carda and this is in Puerto Rico the southern edge of Puerto Rico in
a area which is now pretty much off limits as a nature reserve there's quite a bit of speculation about that as we
shall see this final case was investigated by prolific researcher
Jorge Martin and this case does have numerous Witnesses though apparently ly
only one Mr Senor Miguel Figaroa had the courage to speak to researchers about
his encounters and actually only did so at Great urging by the
researchers this encounter took place at around 300 a.m. again on August 31st
1990 near Lake carda in Puerto Rico it was interesting because on that morning
Miguel was driving to his place of business cuz he had woke up early with a weird feeling that someone was going to
break into his Cafe which he owned and arriving near this area he was shocked
to see about a dozen cars parked there which was very unusual of course for
that time in the morning 3:00 a.m. and everyone there seemed to be very agitated in fact one woman was actually
screaming that she had seen strange little men with huge heads and huge eyes
passing in front of the cars and as Miguel listened to the conversation going on between all these people the
witnesses said that they had all seen these beings and that quote the things were still there now Miguel was
skeptical and he assumed that the Witnesses were victims of some kind of prank but he was curious so he drove
down the 101 road towards the town of boaron this is where the little men had
been moving towards and he drove only a short distance he says before he saw them standing beside the Highway what he
described quote as five most strange little beings three of these beings were
about 3et tall and two were about 4 feet tall and as Miguel said they're clothing
or something I don't know whether it was clothing or their own skin cuz they were all gray it was from head to feet he
said that they did have huge oversized egg-shaped heads long pointed ears ears
and huge shining eyes he said they had three toes on each foot and three long
fingers on each hand and as Miguel says as I drew closer to them my headlights
lit them up then one turned around towards me and I saw that he had big
slanted eyes emitting a very brilliant white light and I could also see that
for noses they had merely tiny holes almost no noses at all
and their mouths were extremely thin and tiny as though with no lips at all their
chins were very small and very pointed and then the rest of them all turned around too and became enveloped in a
very bright light Miguel compared it to a welder's Arc and he said it was so
brilliant that it actually overpowered his own car headlights was so bright he
had to cover his eyes and this frightened him so he quickly reversed
the car and retreated but just a short distance and started to look again as
Miguel says when I had pulled off to a distance they turned away again and
continued walking on along the road just as though nothing had happened I won't deny that I was scared of them and
scared of that light but the sight of it all intrigued me so much that I still went on following them at a
distance so although he was scared his curiosity was stronger than his fear and
Miguel continued to follow them until they reached a small Bridge which traversed a
ravine he watched as the little beings jumped down one after the other to the left of the road and into the Ravine and
were gone and as Miguel says I just remained sitting in the car petrified
with fright but when I went back to that place the next day I saw there in the
mud of the Ravine three sets of little Footprints just like the prints would be
of their feet as I had seen them and the footprints continued on down the
Ravine now researcher Magdalena Del Amo Frido wife of alexio a very well-known
researcher she spoke with the witnesses and actually wrote an article about the case for flying saucer review she
traveled to the exact location of Miguel's encounter and she reports that this area of the lake has many reports
and that quote luminous objects are continually being seen entering and
leaving the lake so this is quite an active area and she also learned that
government authorities had expropriated the Farmland in the area on the pretext
to quote preserve the Flora and the fauna some believe of course that there
are other reasons meaning the UFO activity but in any case the area is now a nature reserve with restricted public
Public Access and coincidentally or not it's also very close to the aerostat
globe which is reportedly according to authorities to detect drug trafficking
but again this is a very known location of High UFO activity and some
researchers think that this detection installation might be more
geared towards monitoring the UFO activity in the area but the witness Miguel says that he
kept quiet about his experience especially after he received a phone call from someone with an American
accent who threatened him if he revealed his encounter and it was weird that he
got this phone call because his number was not listed under his name so whoever
it was was clearly part of an intelligence organization the whole experience was very traumatic for Miguel
to the point that he actually sold his business because because as he says after that night and after what I had
seen things began to go downhill for me now per researcher Magdalena and I quote
at present he always refuses to say or hear anything about the affair and it
took a lot of insistence on our part before he would consent to receive Us in
his own house and relate his experience to us indeed we must say that he has
been very much affected emotionally and that our interview with him was interrupted several times when he burst
into tears as he recalled his very traumatic experience all right that's
our final case this case is so interesting to me it's another example
of a gentleman who quit his job following his encounter was apparently
warned not to speak about it so many interesting details to that case I'm so
glad he finally did agree to speak to researchers and again it makes me wonder just how many cases we never hear
about but we are getting a more and more clear picture of what's going on here as
you probably know if you watch my episodes I do think that we are dealing
with extraterrestrials in the classic sense I think this explanation really fits the evidence better than any other
explanation not to say that every single one of these cases are are extraterrestrials beings from other
planets because it's certainly possible there are other things going on here but
given that there's so many cases they're all humanoid they're flying craft they're giving us these interesting
messages certainly sounds like ETS to me and I will say that their behavior falls
under the same umbrella as human behavior they're doing the same sort of things we would do if we were visiting
another planet but that's why I do this research because there are still a lot of questions surrounding ET
contact and it's time to end skepticism disbelief ridicule and
certainly this ridiculous UFO coverup how many cases do we need to say that
this is real I think we have enough so that's it for today I really want to
thank you for watching I love all you guys it's for you I do this show so
thank you thank thank you thank you and until next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth
it's up to us to find it our governments are not going to give it to us but most
important of all keep having fun and I will talk to you guys later bye for
now
