FIFTY UFO PHOTOGRAPHS FROM CALIFORNIA
Jul 22, 2022

Summary:
Jul 22, 2022
According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC,) California has more UFO sightings than any other state in the United States. So it should come as no surprise that there are many cases involving UFO photographs. In fact, there are hundreds of incidents in which witnesses have been able to capture images of unidentified flying objects.

This video presents more than fifty cases of some of the best UFO photographs taken in the state of California. Many of these are multiple-witness cases with photographs that have been authenticated by UFO researchers and photographic experts. Some are well-known, while others have received almost no publicity. The majority of these photographs show solid metallic objects hovering in the sky. In some of these cases, it appears that the UFOs want to be seen, and are posing for the witnesses.

It has often been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. When it comes to UFOs, this is especially true. These amazing photographs provide hard evidence for the reality of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. We are not alone! And these photographs prove it!

With so many cases, the state of California has had a profound effect on our understanding and knowledge of the UFO phenomenon.

Hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of ufos in the paranormal 
today's episode i call 50 ufo photos from california 
people are always talking about if ufos are real where's the evidence and the truth is there is an 
enormous amount of evidence and many different types of evidence landing traces of course 
medical evidence electromagnetic effects animal reactions radar returns 
but i think certainly among the most interesting types of evidence is photographic evidence and 
that's what i want to talk about today california has had an enormous number of encounters in fact 
it leads the nation in the number of encounters according to the national ufo reporting center 
so it should come as no surprise that there are a lot of photographic cases and i'd like 
to present to you what i think are probably the 50 best ufo photographs taken in california 
a few of these are quite well known many are very well verified vetted by ufo researchers 
and photographic experts some are not some have just a little bit of information and have not 
been fully investigated but i think all of them are quite interesting so let's just get started 
the first photograph i'd like to present to you there's not a lot known about it all we 
really know is that this was taken over catalina island during the day apparently by a tourist 
and it shows a metallic craft high in the sky what i like about this photograph is it was 
taken very early in terms of ufo history this was before the modern age of ufos 
sometime in the 1940s perhaps earlier it's a very interesting daylight photo of a solid 
metallic craft and it's one of the earliest taken in california
this next photograph pictured here was taken in february 1942 during what is known as the la air 
raid or the battle of l.a on that evening the entire city of los angeles went into an 
enforced blackout because numerous unidentified craft were seen coming in over the city from the 
pacific ocean some of these were quite small but one was very large the one pictured here 
with searchlights trained on it this very large object moved in over culver city 
and sort of parked there for a period of about two hours during which the army trained searchlights 
on it and fired about 1400 rounds of ammunition at it they were unable to bring it down whatever this 
object was was totally silent the only result was that five people died from falling debris 
car accidents heart attacks this sort of thing after about two hours this object moved away 
back over the pacific ocean and off into the distance there was some debunking explanations 
that this was perhaps a dirigible or japanese aircraft there's no evidence of that in fact 
i talked to a first-hand witness and he said there was no way these were balloons or normal 
conventional aircraft he saw one of these smaller objects swooped down quite low over his home 
the next day this photo appeared on the cover of the la times and while there was 
a initially a cover-up enacted of this event today there are documents released through the 
freedom of information act declassified documents showing that our own government did not know 
what this object was and it remains a mystery to this day it's one of the best authenticated 
ufo photographs in california history and that's why i wanted to include it on this list 
and now we move to the next case july 8 1943 when three visiting army veterans reported their 
observations of six flying discs over catalina island the six discs appeared around 1 pm in 
fluent formation first there was one set of three disks followed later by another set of 
three disks each moved at high speeds appeared from the north east and passed directly over 
avalon and according to the veterans hundreds of people were present and also observed the discs 
one of the gentlemen alvio russo had flown more than 35 bombing missions over 
germany and he estimated these objects were moving at 850 miles per hour 
but that evening bob young an aerial photographer said that these objects flew as fast as the navy 
tiny tim rocket which he had photographed many times and when the ufos appeared 
again he managed to quickly snap this photograph pictured here
moving along here is a very famous picture of a ufo which was taken in burbank california in 1945. 
the gentleman featured here is jack lamont who is on his horse on horseback 
near the pickwick riding stables in burbank california this was a june morning in 1945. 
the ufo was not noticed at the time this picture was taken but as you can see jack lamonde 
was in full military uniform he had served in the south pacific with the u.s marine corps 
but when this photograph was developed you could see this clear picture of a classic 
flying saucer what looks like a solid metallic object in the sky it's really quite intriguing
this next photo there's is not a whole lot known about it only that it was taken by a gentleman by 
the name of joe mcbride this photograph has been featured many many times it was taken 
in the mojave desert in 1950 but otherwise there's not a whole lot else known about it 
but i wanted to include it here because it's a very famous photograph
this next photograph was taken in 1951 as you can see we're moving through time but this photograph 
was taken near riverside california on november 23rd 1951 by a gentleman by the name of guy b 
markhand jr this is an excellent photograph which has never been debunked or explained and according 
to guy he said he saw this object just above the skyline a flying saucer guy marcon was enlisted in 
the us army in l.a and he was single he had four years of high school came from riverside he saw 
this object and managed to capture this photograph pictured here he lived to be quite elderly 
lived in carlsbad california with his wife and uh has never backed down 
saying that this photograph displays exactly what he saw way back in 1950
this next photograph was taken on august in august of 1952 by the fifteen-year-old son of 
a california surgeon his name is michael savage and he snapped a photo of this object which 
which was hovering near these power lines in san bernardino and he tried to get a second 
shot but in his haste he overcranked the camera and drew a blank negative but he said that this 
object was hovering near his house for about 30 seconds and this photograph was in fact published 
in the newspapers it caused quite a sensation and no one has ever been able to explain it
here's an interesting photograph which was taken place on september 3rd 1953 in modesto california 
this photograph was taken by charles rogers and it shows an unidentified elliptical shaped 
yellowish light on the right and the light appeared to remain stationary so when he 
first saw it he quickly set his camera up on the roof left the shutter open and got this result 
no other information about this photograph is available but it's certainly an interesting photograph of something unexplained in the sky
this next photograph is actually taken from a moving film it caused quite a sensation at the 
time this photograph this series of photographs or moving film rather was taken on april 15 1956 
by leland hansen a navy photographer leland hanson was on assignment filming 
catalina island from a helicopter when he saw this object hovering in place 
and when it started to move he decided that he would film it 
he started filming this object as it slowly moved away and a later analysis of the film 
revealed that this object was featureless and oval shaped with no apparent wings or tail structure 
it was about 30 feet in diameter and moving at an estimated 130 to 170 miles per hour 
the footage was first aired in 1979 13 years after the incident on the popular television documentary 
ufos are real produced by brandon chase scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory analyzed the 
footage and observe what they thought might be a tail rudder however the fact that the object was 
first seen hovering in place pretty much rules out the plane theory nor could jpl explain how leland 
hansen a trained observer familiar with aircraft would be unable to match what he saw to any known 
aircraft so while some have tried to debunk the footage this object has never been identified
this next photograph is an excellent photograph which was taken by joe kerska on october 10 
1956 over the city of san francisco on that day joe kerska a commercial photographer 
had climbed up to twin peaks to take a panoramic photograph of the city of san francisco 
it was around 12 30 p.m when he heard a strange humming noise and looking up 
he saw a large disc shaped craft with a dome on top zooming overhead he was so shocked that at 
first he forgot about his camera which was already set up and ready to go and he was so disappointed 
that he didn't even think of getting a photograph when suddenly another identical craft moved ahead 
this time he didn't hesitate and he quickly snapped a photograph and as you can see this photo shows a silver metallic saucer less than a hundred feet distant 
from the witness it's a very famous photograph which has never been explained and it's certainly 
one of the best photographs taken over california at that time
here's another very interesting photograph which was taken in september of 1957 
over edwards air force base this was taken by a test pilot a ufo was apparently following a b-57 
twin jet the ufo was not seen at the time this photograph was taken 
however when the photograph was developed this object could be seen and 
there's not a whole lot known about it because no one actually saw it but is absolutely an excellent 
photo for this time period not everyone sees the ufos when they're taking a photograph they only 
see it when the camera is developed and that is exactly what happened in this next photograph 
which was taken by a gentleman with the initials b c he was at lake isabella in california in 1957 
did not see anything unusual but as you can see he took a photograph and this photo shows 
an unidentified disc-like object that looked like it was about to land 
at the time the gentleman who photographed this object and his fiancee 
were riding their harley-davidson motorcycle in the south of the sierra nevadas 
when they decided to take a picture of the old dirt road that led to the dry lake bed again 
they did not see anything strange when the photo was taken not until it was developed did they see 
this object so i think that itself lends a degree of authenticity to it it's clearly not a glitch 
in the photograph it's very hard to explain this is anything other than the genuine ufo
now here is another very interesting photograph which is allegedly taken from a moving film taken at edwards air force base in 1958 
allegedly this is a clip from a film that was leaked of a ufo landing at edwards air force base 
uh reportedly this was a film which was viewed by the late astronaut gordon cooper 
who was present at the time in an interview with journalist lee spiegel 
gordon cooper said that when he was project manager of the flight test center at edwards 
in 1958 a large metallic flying disk actually landed at the base several air force personnel 
observed the landing and were able to take motion pictures and as gordon cooper says the disc was 
hovering above the ground and then it slowly came down and sat on the lake bed for a few minutes 
there were various estimates by the cameramen on what the actual size of the object was 
but they all agreed it was at least the size of a vehicle that would carry normal sized 
people in it it was a typical circular shaped ufo not too many people saw because it took 
off at quite a sharp angle and just climbed out of sight i think it was definitely a ufo 
so although gordon cooper didn't witness the actual craft he did view the film which he found 
very convincing as per orders he sent the film to washington washington dc and never heard from it 
again however on a later occasion stephen greer md conducted a follow-up interview 
and confirmed the details of this encounter and as astronaut gordon cooper is quoted as saying 
at edwards air force base i was having some of the cameramen film precision landings and we 
were right on the edge of a dry lake a saucer flew over them put down three landing gears and 
landed out on the dry lake bed they went out there with their cameras towards the ufo it 
lifted off put the gear back in the well and flew off at a very high rate of speed and disappeared 
so while i was going through all of the regulation books and finding out the number to call 
in washington to report this i had the cameraman go over and develop the film by the time they got 
back with the developed film i had a higher and higher and higher level officers talking with me 
finally a colonel told me that when the film arrived on my desk to put it in a courier file 
there would be a courier there at my office and they would arrange for him to fly in our base 
airplane back to washington with these films the colonel said to not run the prince so we stuck 
them in the courier packets now gordon cooper did examine this film first hand and as he says 
these were good close up shots nothing like i had ever seen double inverted saucer shaped it 
didn't have wings or on it or anything it was pretty much the same saucer shape at that point 
in time there was no doubt in my mind that it was made someplace other than here on earth 
and although this count encounter was amazing gordon cooper said that it wasn't unique as he 
told lee spiegel there were always strange things flying around in the air over edwards and i can 
absolutely confirm that i did a whole youtube episode on the events at edwards air force base 
events which started at least as early as 1942 and continue up to the present day so here is another 
excellent photo which was taken over lake casitas located just inland of the coast in ventura 
this is very near santa catalina channel an area of very high levels of ufo activity 
in 1959 a dam was built which formed lake casitas but one day in 1964 an air force pilot from world 
war ii by the name of frank s kinsey was at lake casitas with his brother-in-law when they heard a 
loud sound of splashing water and as frank kinsey says i looked out into the lake and here's this 
object coming out of the water so this case was actually investigated by mufon field investigator 
robert d neville who interviewed frank kinsey frank kinsey told him that this object emerged 
from the water with such speed that it sucked up this large column of water which came loudly 
crashing down and this is what frank and his brother-in-law heard and as frank says 
i was flabbergasted it was a round object and it looked like it had a cone on top where a 
person was looking out at us a being looking out at us i could see the eyes staring at us 
i happened to have a pair of binoculars with me at the time i picked them up and looked and i 
could see a person looking out at me according to frank this object was about 30 feet wide 
the outside perimeter of the object appeared to be rotating and it was emitting a painfully loud 
noise you could see several portholes situated around the top cone section of the object and it 
was through one of these portholes that he saw the being he said the window itself quote looked like 
it was real thick heavy glass of some kind or maybe it might have been a plastic of some kind 
as he watched this object suddenly accelerated glowing first a lavender color and then bright 
orange yellow in just a few seconds it was about 15 miles away he estimates and 
disappeared over the mountains however he was able to snap a photograph of it as it moved off 
and as frank kinsey says it had a gleam to it it had a shine to it like nothing i'd ever seen i've 
seen a lot of metals here on earth that had a high gloss but nothing like this that i've ever seen 
as you can see this photograph clearly shows a solid object you can just make out the portholes 
it's a shame he didn't get a photograph of it sooner where you could see this figure looking out 
of the portholes but nevertheless this is a very well authenticated well-vetted photograph of a 
ufo or uso perhaps coming out of lake casitas a daylight photo which is 
uh quite rare and again has never been explained
probably california's best ufo photos were taken on august 3rd 1965 
by los angeles county highway investigator rex hefflin 
part of rex heflin's job included taking photos of car accidents and because of this 
he always carried a polaroid camera next to him on the seat and on august 3rd 1965 
during the day he was driving along an isolated stretch of road outside of santa ana when he saw 
a silent hat shaped ufo pacing his truck this object was sending down a white beam of light 
he was quite impressed by this so he tried to radio his supervisor but the radio went dead 
a fact that was later confirmed by his supervisor rex heflin quickly grabbed his polaroid camera 
and managed to snap a series of four photographs before this metallic disc disappeared off into the 
haze at that point rex immediately radiated his supervisor again the radio now worked perfectly 
after the incident he sought no publicity however reporters from the united press international in 
los angeles heard about the photos and they persuaded him to turn them over for study 
he agreed and the upi photo experts conducted an extensive analysis 
even attempting to restage the whole incident at the same area and after the study the photo 
experts at upi declared them genuine and as you can see these photos clearly show a large metallic 
object hovering an estimated 20 feet above the road one of these photos actually shows a strange 
disturbance underneath the object something like a little dust devil so rex heflin like 
many witnesses who have hard evidence of ufos did receive a mysterious visit a few weeks later from 
a man claiming to be from norad the man demanded the photographs rex heflin turned them over
later they denied that they ever had or studied the photographs and the air force denounced the 
pictures as a hoax in response nycap photographic analyst ralph renko and other scientists studied 
the pictures in detail and also declared them genuine today the rex heflin photographs have 
been very widely published in fact journalist and ufo author and investigator frank edwards calls 
the photos quote the best ufo photographs in civilian hands so yeah while these are 
controversial i think these are absolutely genuine photographs and perhaps the best photographs in 
california so here's another very controversial photograph which was taken in joshua tree in 1965 
by a controversial contactee and rocket scientist daniel fry daniel frye claims to 
have been taken on board a ufo in new mexico and became a contactee very well known and 
wrote in fact two books about his case which somewhat divided the ufo community up to this 
day today many ufo researchers take his case very seriously he did manage to capture many excellent 
photographs and even films of ufo and this is one of them which was taken in 1965 over joshua tree 
so you can make up your own mind about whether or not this is a genuine photograph but i think 
it does deserve a place on this list and moving along through time we now move to january 24 1967. 
this photograph was taken in yorba linda at around twilight by a teenager named tom he 
was 14 years old and he saw this dark hat-shaped object hovering outside the second story window 
of his home this is a small relatively isolated town on the edge of orange county california 
so we quickly rushed to another room to get his little inexpensive mark 7 fixed focus camera and 
returned within seconds by this point the object had moved moved farther away from the window 
but he was still able to snap one black and white picture before running downstairs shouting for his family to come and view this strange craft 
unfortunately by the time they had climbed the stairs this ufo had moved out of sight 
but tom did have the impression that this object was quote gigantic but he could not really 
say for sure how big it was because he wasn't quite sure how close it was 
but it did have the impression that it was quite close and quite large it's an excellent photograph
and that same year on may 11 1967 a witness was able to take a photograph of a ufo over 
torrance california now there's not a whole lot of information about this photograph but it was taken 
on a saturday night there were three kids alan bobby rick and danny uh who were hanging out out 
when they saw this object that they said glowed a reddish white one of the boys had a camera 
and took this photo which is a fairly clear shot but we don't really have a lot of details 
about it still it's a very interesting photograph moving along this next photograph was taken 
uh in august of 1976 over the city of petaluma california and as the witness 
says and i quote i was shooting ektachrome film on a warm summer evening north of petaluma 
in august of 1976. i shot several exposures in a five minute period when i was able to capture 
this shot everything is silhouetted as the sun had already gone down but this was easily seen 
there are four blue dots on the flat side of the object and the edge would tend to show 
it was moving very quickly and an enlargement of this photograph shows quite a bit of detail 
and a copy was sent in the early 1980s to walt andrus who was the head of mufon 
and uh as the witness says having this on film and going through some strange events made me a 
believer and since then over the past 20 years i have seen a few odd things in the sky that keep me 
looking up now here's a very interesting and clear uh series of photographs there were actually four 
four photographs taken by gigi brobeck over santa monica in february of 1979. 
this these are from the files of joe clower and these two photographs pictured here 
are overlooking the santa monica bay in fact on the left of the photo you can actually 
see the santa monica pier there's santa monica beach below these are very clear photos of your 
typical classic metallic flying saucer totally silent and gigi managed to take 
four photographs as this object moved off into the distance over santa monica bay
this next case is very well verified it's taken by a trained observer a pilot this photograph was 
taken on july 16 1988 over san jacinto california it was taken by john r english who was a past 
director of the international aerospace hall of fame in san diego air and space historical and 
at the time of this photograph he was involved in the research selection and installation of 
several us and foreign astronauts as well as other significant aviation related candidates 
he was a licensed pilot and a diamond level soaring pilot for 18 years with approximately 400 
flight hours logged 350 in high performance sail planes in multiple flight envelopes and conditions 
so he was up there with two aircraft and observed this weird anomaly and it was actually 
photographed by the chase plane and i'd like to just quote john english directly as he says i'm a 
past director of the international aerospace hall of fame and during several flights a great deal of 
time is spent flying in close proximity with other aircraft necessitating a continual visual visual 
search for other aircraft under the c and b scene discipline and what follows is a brief description 
and file of an event over mount san jacinto in california a number of photos were taken without 
anything unusual then a bank and turn to the right away from the chase plane was made and during this 
turn both aircraft and chase plane photographed the included anomaly this object came from the 
seven o'clock position relative to the sail plane and at a distance of about one to two miles 
in front and exited vision at the one o'clock position relative to the sail plane 
the best description i can give is that it looked like a large reflective sphere about the size of 
a quarter held at arm's length the object was observed for 5 to 10 seconds until out of sight 
no extreme maneuvers were observed no sound was heard and no wake turbulence was encountered 
i have no idea what the object was nor have i ever seen anything like it either before or 
after this flight this event took place in july 1988 the original photograph and negative as well 
as the flight log are still in my possession so this is a very hard to debunk event taken by a 
pilot with considerable experience a trained observer very hard to explain away 
some photographs are taken out of sheer luck by amateurs such as this next photograph 
which was taken in 1991 very close to los angeles international airport which by the 
way has an enormous amount of ufo activity i did a whole usbo episode on youtube of
ufos over lax this photograph was taken by dorothy drudge she saw this object hovering 
at very low altitude she said it was so foggy on that day the visibility was very poor 
but this object was quite close quite low and she saw it flying by it was totally silent she quickly snapped a photograph of it 
and uh this object moved off very quickly she only saw it for a few moments so it was sheer luck that 
she was able to capture this very clear photograph of a metallic disc hovering at low altitude 
the number of ufo photographic cases is truly astonishing and for each one that's presented 
here there are many others i did not present so this should just be considered a small sampling 
here's another case involving a ufo photograph this one comes from joe clower who contributed to 
the ufo photo archives of wendell stevens i wasn't able to find out a whole lot of information about 
this particular case who took the photograph but it was taken in los angeles california and as you 
can see this is a daylight photo quite close up quite low level of a dark metallic saucer-shaped 
object and what i like about this photograph is you can clearly see from the light scattering 
that this is an object that is some distance from the camera itself and like many very clear ufo 
photographs it's almost as if this object is posing and allowing itself to be photographed 
it's certainly an interesting case even though there isn't a whole lot of information about it 
i love this photograph which was taken in may of 1993 by a woman who does not want her last name 
uh known she's known only by our first name which is judy at the time there 
was a huge wave of sightings going on in this area of the santa monica mountains 
judy was in her home in malibu one evening when she saw a group of about a dozen reddish 
glowing half discs and she quickly snapped several photos this is just one of them 
which shows clearly a group of metallic discs moving in over the santa monica bay and uh as 
you can see these are bright glowing disc shaped objects and have never been explained to this day
moving along this next photo was taken on july 6 over the armagosa range in california by a 
gentleman by the name of jim w i don't have any other information on this photograph but i 
wanted to include it because it's a very clear daylight photo of a metallic disc at low level
two years later in 1998 michael davey of los angeles was hiking through a remote area in titus canyon when he observed a 
large metallic ufo hovering overhead he always carried a camera with him on his hikes and on 
this occasion when he saw this disc he quickly lifted up his camera and was able to obtain 
one clear photo of this disc as it hovered in the daylight sky over two radar towers in the distance 
he turned this photo over to wendell stevens a very well-known ufo researcher 
who specialized in ufo photographs this is from the ufo photo archives kept by wendell stevens 
uh he had photographic analysts checked his pictures out and there was no evidence of 
trickery or hoaxing and he declared them genuine it's a very clear photo of a metallic disc 
so as you can see year after year excellent photos are being taken of ufos over california 
here's a case which occurred in september this was taken by a contactee by the name of steve 
thompson and this photograph was taken over pacific palisades this is located in the 
santa monica mountains and there's a lot of ufo activity in this area 
and it's a very clear photo of a shiny metallic disc hovering right over a residence 
again this was taken in september of 1996 and it's an excellent photograph of what appears to 
be an extraterrestrial spacecraft here is a photo that was taken again by a contactee steve thompson 
over topanga canyon california i was a resident of topanga canyon i know exactly where this photo 
was taken i've been there many times and in fact i had my own ufo sighting less than a mile from this 
area and i know of several other cases involving ufo encounters in this exact location and this is 
a very clear photo taken by steve thompson of a ufo over topanga state park this photo is again 
from the ufo photo archives of wendell stevens and this next photo was taken on january 1st 2001 
over mammoth mountain california by ron resnick he's a computer tech 
and a professional photographer and up to this time this object has never been identified
the taker of this photo ron resnick says that this photo was taken on his nikon d1 camera 
very expensive camera five thousand dollar digital slr camera he says 
the lens was brand new a nicor 17-35 millimeter f28d af-6ef
in perfect condition this is he says one of the world's finest wide angle lenses 
and the lens itself cost fifteen hundred dollars and he bought it just a few days 
before he took this photograph of this object over mammoth mountain that same year 
may 18 2001 over foster city california this photograph was taken 
and all that is known about about this photograph is it was taken by a gentleman who calls 
themselves islam and uh this photographer took several photographs of a ufo seen in the night sky 
there are two excellent photographs and as you can see from the blow up it shows what appears to be 
little portholes and while these photographs have not been officially 
analyzed they show what appears to be a genuine ufo
all right moving along april 21st 2002 san dimas california 
this object was not seen by the naked eye it appeared in the photographs after they were taken 
this was taken by aaron eskridge and he had a brand new digital camera and 
he was snapping a series of shots to put together a large landscape photo photograph 
and captured this object and he showed it around uh to various newspapers into jpl 
and cal poly in ponoma and they told him that since he did not see it at the time or 
hear anything there isn't really much to go upon in terms of analyzing this which 
he agrees on however as he says i still think the object in this shot is very typical of what 
is described as a ufo and believe it deserves to be posted for others to critique and not 
buried in my hard drive here's another photograph that has gotten quite a bit of publicity 
this was taken on the afternoon of january 3rd 2004 by a gentleman by the name of young chiron 
he was on the beach of santa monica when he observed a metallic disc-like object 
hovering a few thousand feet directly above a yacht and this object was stationary in the sky 
just sitting there right over this boat so he quickly grabbed his camera and snapped 
this photograph and because he knew approximately the length of this yacht 
he estimates that the size of the ufo is probably about 30 feet wide and after just a few moments 
this object darted away at high speed so clearly not a balloon or a plane or a helicopter 
or anything like this and again this was taken in an area of very high ufo activity
here is another photograph which is credited to a woman by the name of jennifer 
this was taken on january 29 2005 over chula vista it was taken with a cannon mini dv camcorder 
with 4.0 mega pixels and as the witness says the photos were taken near my home 
on january 29 2005 starting at 5 pm and ending at 6 00 pm 
jen says she felt this urge to go outside and then saw these objects she followed this object 
around in her car for about an hour and she never drove more than five miles away from her home 
so it was as if this object was posing for her which i think they are sometimes doing in these photographic cases but she was quite impressed and sent it off to ufo researchers 
and as you can see this object is quite impressive all right that same year july 2005 
photographs of a ufo were taken over modesta california the witness's name is our david 
anderson and i'll just quote him directly as he says i took some additional photos of this unusual 
object that had been above my residence at night this time the craft was towards the south and the 
stars and the pictures are a part of the scorpius constellation the roof of my house is barely 
visible in one of the pictures the place this places the ufo at fairly low position on the 
southern horizon is remarkable how it appears to be moving at a 30 degree angle towards the ground 
was the craft diving towards some other object that is not visible 
i can't really think of any other reason why the craft has such a slant it has to 
be moving downwards because its direction of travel is towards the right of the frame
all right moving along this next photograph was taken by watson morris 
who sent his photograph to coast to coast this photograph was taken on december 12 2005 over half 
moon bay and as watson says here is the best of about five or six photos that i took of 
three mysterious discs flying over half moon bay beach in northern california last week i was out 
shooting some black and white shots of the rocks when i heard some people on the beach yelling to 
each other to look up in the sky above the water these disc type aircraft came from over the rocks 
very very slowly it was hard to tell how high they were but the closest one didn't seem much higher 
than 200 feet and then moved out towards the water the whole sighting lasted no more than 30 seconds
so yeah some very clear photos moving along one year later february 8th 
2006. these photos were taken by eduardo garcia and credit goes to anna louise 
sid these photos were taken with a digital camera and apparently this was a chance encounter because 
this ufos were not noticed at the time when this witness took the photograph he was taking pictures 
of the zeppelin and didn't notice this ufo off in the distance until he developed the photographs 
these were taken again over los angeles at about 5 52 p.m using a nikon d70 camera that same year 
april 26 2006 modesto california a gentleman who wants to remain anonymous his first name is johnny 
sent these off to the ufo case book and as he says i was feeling pretty good about my captures and 
went back outside to retrieve my camera and tripod i had just grabbed the tripod and started to walk 
back when i noticed a huge reflection in the north by the northwest skies and i thought to myself 
i'm here with my camera and tripod in my hand so what the hell let's take a few more shots 
i had the camera in burst mode so it was able to fire off five shots instantly and then came back 
inside to see if i'd gotten lucky again the very first shot nearly made me fall out of my chair 
it seems to have many of the characteristics of a classic disc i quickly opened up the small 
photo program to zoom in on the object and was surprised to see what appears to be a 
cupola on top of this object this next photograph again comes from the files of anna louise 
sid with the collaboration of alex sender these photos were taken by larry wex das 
near the towns of hercules and vallejo on july 1st 2006 at approximately 1 30 p.m in 
the afternoon larry saw this object hovering near some tanks and he used his nikon e5200 
camera and took these photographs uh he sent his report and photographs to anna louisa sid and as 
you can see this photograph appears to show a disc shaped object it's a very clear daylight photo
that same year december 29 2006 over santa cruz california john tisdale was sightseeing and taking 
photographs along the north coast of santa cruz he was on a back road just south of bonnie dune 
and was taking a photo of this picturesque landscape the camera was pointing east he did 
not see any object in the sky at the time the camera was a hewlett packard photosmart r967 
10 megapixels in auto mode the shutter speed was set at ambient lighting conditions 
he didn't see it at the time but it was captured in the photograph
this next photograph was taken by the gentleman by the name of caesar this appears in the ufo 
case book this was taken on june 1st 2007 over los angeles and as caesar says i visited the los 
angeles county arboretum in botanical gardens in arcadia on friday june 1st 2007 my wife and i were 
looking to find a place to take our wedding pictures and we found this beautiful park we 
were taking a tour of the place i snapped several pictures and drove home when i was downloading the 
pictures and viewing them i noticed an object in one of them i do not know what it is i am 
interested to know what it is i hope you can help me please share this object with your listeners 
so again we see that many people who take ufo photos don't actually see them at the time these photos are being taken the camera can capture things that the eye can't see because 
these objects are sometimes moving so fast that the eye cannot pick them up but the camera can
here's a photograph which was submitted to mufon case number 7257
this was taken in 2007 by an anonymous witness
and this was over san pasqual high school as the witness says it was a relatively clear afternoon 
my girlfriend and i were at the local high school getting ready to jog on their track we were on top 
of a hill that overlooks the stadium when we saw a bright star-like object approach from the east as 
it came closer its shape became more apparent more boomerang shaped but very smooth the top side was 
made of what appeared to be a highly reflective gold colored metal the bottom of the object was 
the color of dull bronze it didn't seem to reflect the light i had my backpack with me and luckily 
inside it was my camera so in haste i quickly retrieved my camera ran closer to the object 
it made absolutely no sound and it initially moved very slowly too slow for an airplane to 
fly as it approached us the object banked to the north and after about 30 seconds reversed 
its direction revealing its side to us we watched it for some time as it banked back and forth then 
all of a sudden it tipped its nose to about a 45 degree angle and quickly ascended out of sight 
i was quickly out of sight after about three seconds i wasn't afraid when i saw this object 
just fascinated by its erratic movements and its beauty it was truly a beautiful thing to behold
this next series of photographs created quite a stir they were taken by 
a gentleman who leaked them out his name is allegedly keith bradshaw these were taken in 2007. 
there is no information about these photos other than that they were taken over 
china lake during the day but what's very interesting about this location is it does have 
an enormous amount of ufo activity there's a lot of very high level rocket testing and aeronautical 
research going on in this area in fact ufo researcher richard thompson interviewed a 
gentleman by the name of elmer greene who worked at china lake and said that ufos appeared all 
the time and according to richard thompson and i quote in his position green frequently heard about 
incidents in which ufos flew into camera range during weapons testing and were photographed 
you heard about good quality films that had been made of ufos and he personally saw black 
and white still photos of ufos that were made by people in his group he was aware of some 40 to 50 
professional people who had some connection with ufo sightings made during weapons testing 
so maybe that's what's going on here in these photographs as you can see one does show a helicopter in flight but these are very clear 
just excellent daylight photos of a very shiny silver metallic disc
all right moving along 2009 over san diego california according to the witness this photo 
was taken on january 10 2009 with a camera phone while i was hiking with a friend in san diego 
county the ufo appeared briefly hovered and then vanished just as i took the picture if you zoom in 
on the picture you can see an electrical discharge coming out of the high power lines below the ufo i 
have seen other ufos in san diego but only at night this one was up close in broad daylight 
and scared the heck out of me according to the witness the camera was an lg electronics bg vx8350
it's an interesting photo not only because it's a metallic disc daylight close up low 
level but it's hovering over power lines there are many cases of ufos hovering over power lines 
and ufo researchers speculate that the ufos are perhaps scooping up the electricity 
that's being emitted out of these power lines and this could be good evidence of that given 
that you can actually see just faintly in electrical discharge above these power lines
all right moving along this is an interesting photo which was again taken during the day 
over in the catalina channel again an area of very high level of ufo activity this was taken 
on february 2009 by nancy bradley and if you look closely you can see what appears to be a 
uso diving into the water so there's some very interesting elements to this photo 
nancy bradley the witness is a seasoned traveler to catalina her family traveled there each year 
doing dives with the catalina conservancy to help preserve the pristine beauty of the area and on 
that day the water was unnaturally calm she also said that there were strange large random waves 
and she says and i quote this was a very strange behavior for the sea very strange indeed 
and they were about halfway to the island when the steward of the boat pointed out a group of 
dolphins and nancy was amazed while she had seen dolphins many times and even whales 
this display was different because there were hundreds of dolphins as far as the eye could see 
and they were jumping frantically it appeared to her as she says they were quote seemingly 
trying to get away from something and suddenly they disappeared however a few miles ahead the 
same thing happened large numbers of dolphins were swimming at high speed jumping from the water and 
diving and nancy bradley could hardly believe what happened next as she says and i quote 
a large object white almost not detectable from the clouds in the sky hovered we watched it as 
it swayed from side to side and after about a half minute it made a beeline disappearing into the sea 
by pure chance nancy was snapping a photo at that very moment this photo that you can see 
here and an interesting end note to all of this as nancy bradley says they went 
to catalina island and were eating at the local restaurant and she learned that this 
area was well known for high levels of ufo activity as she says several of the locals 
who overheard our conversation asked to join us at our table anxious to relate their own stories 
they said late at night we see lights going into the bay about a mile out one gentleman told us 
others shaking their heads in agreement the waitress chimed in 
one night there was a naval ship just offshore patrolling this is not uncommon but what i saw 
that was strange was what went on behind them large scale triangular objects three of them 
craft floating above the ship and then after circling they made a quick retreat into the sea 
i noticed several small boats showing up shortly after this event looking for what happened it is 
all so strange a man who has lived there most of his life on the island told us generally they are 
white those craft he said and when they hit the water they turn a light blue i know because they 
are fluorescent and you can see them for a short time going down into the water into the water 
so nancy and her family were very impressed they had heard of activity in this area but this was 
their first sighting and it left them forever changed and as nancy says for now we know one 
thing there are usos around catalina island what they are all about we are determined to find out
now here's another interesting photo which was taken on october 29 2011 over beverly 
hills california this photo was actually taken by victoria beckham who is posh spice of the 
band spice girls and she insists that she saw and photographed this glowing object over her home 
she described it as an extremely bright orb much too bright to be an airplane light a star or the 
moon said it was casting light on the trees below and it appeared to be fairly close to the ground 
she tweeted this photo of the ufo with the following message ufo hovering above our house 
last night and she says that there were other witnesses to this object some people have tried to 
describe this as the moon i'll let you make your own mind about it all right now we move to 2014.
and again many cases exist in the ufo literature in which people take a photo only to have the ufo shown up that was not seen when they took the picture 
so consider this case which was taken in july of 2014. and uh i was actually personally contacted 
by this woman her name is laurie and she contacted me uh not because she had actually seen this ufo 
because this ufo and others were actually showing up in her photographs lori says she's loves taking 
pictures she's an amateur photographer and enthusiast and constantly takes pictures 
wherever she goes on her digital camera and occasionally there are glitches on her photographs 
but in around 2014 she had taken some photos of what looked like tic tac objects over zuma beach 
it was a very crowded day when she took these photos there were many people on the beach and 
she when she developed these or when she looked at these two photographs which were taken one 
after the other two of these photographs show a very large tic-tac-shaped object apparently 
leaving the water and it doesn't look like a glitch if this were truly a glitch why would 
up here would it appear in two separate images in slightly different positions again she never saw 
anything when she took this photo no one else on the beach seemed to react to anything so lori is 
still seeking answers about what she photographed here's another excellent photographic case this 
was taken in march of 2015 by an anonymous witness as he says i was driving on palomar 
airport road in carlsbad california driving to my son's baseball game at 7 15 p.m and i observed a 
saucer-like object in the sky through the driver's side window north of my location 
fortunately i had my dslr with me because of the baseball game so i rolled my window down 
and took three pictures in rapid succession my daughter and i both watched it 
until we were forced to proceed with traffic and it was gone so he first thought it might 
be a drone but after examining the photos he's reconsidering and thinks it may be an actual ufo 
this next series of photographs were taken that same year on september 1st 2015 at 3 o'clock p.m 
and what's really interesting is they were these photographs were taken in the vicinity of san quentin prison as i talked about in a previous youtube episode there are a lot of cases of ufos 
hovering over prisons this was right next to the prison in uh near the san rafael bridge near court 
madera and as the witness says not quite sure how to start other than to tell you what i saw today 
i was driving over the richmond san rafael bridge from work towards corta madera california today 
and i saw this extremely bright almost chrome-like sphere hovering over san quentin prison it had a 
little bit of a blue hue to it and it looked like it was rotating or pulsing i couldn't pull over 
on the bridge and lost sight of it behind the hill i was sure i'd catch it in the past between 
the bridge and larkspur landing so much so i got out of my car at the shooting range there 
it was perplexed that it wasn't there i got back in my car hoping to see it again 
i was looking all over and i saw it over by the village shopping center south of the 101. 
i lost sight of it at the hill next to the parking lot because it was heading towards mount tam 
was very low in the sky i was looking frantically to my left and only glanced to my right to turn 
off the freeway and spotted it on the opposite side on my far right between me and the north hill 
of corte madera i pulled over immediately and used my work ipad to quickly snap five photos in rapid 
succession after 15 to 30 seconds it appeared to almost fade into itself and disappear i sat there 
baffled the pictures don't show how bright this thing truly was it was like looking into the sun
all right one year later may 24 2016. an anonymous gentleman took these photographs at around 
6 30 a.m when he stepped out of his home in carlsbad he could see the ocean as well as 
san clemente island and catalina and as he says i always look out to the ocean for the view but 
today i saw something i had never seen before way out on the horizon i noticed a glow on the water 
at first glance i thought it was the sun's reflection as it was really bright that would 
have been impossible due to the sun's position at the time plus it was clearly sitting on top 
of the water it looked like a large strip of light my wife also saw the object at first he thought 
it might be a cruise ship though he's seen cruise ships and he'd never seen one out there before and 
it certainly didn't look like one he grabbed his binoculars and got a close-up look at it it was 
just a strip of light it clearly wasn't a cruise ship as he says i didn't see any body of structure 
just bright lights either one long large one or many very close together to form a strip 
it didn't move and after he confirmed that this was unexplained he got his camera and snapped 
this photo he watched it for a few minutes went inside briefly turned outside five minutes later 
and the object was gone so if it was a ship it would have been seen you would think in a 
nearby location but it had disappeared rather quickly so yeah perhaps it's unexplained 
all right just a few more cases i'd like to share with you this next case took place on 2017 
and i will just quote the witness directly when i looked through the binocs i have two pair one with 
the stabilizer one with extra magnification i expected to see lanterns flares balloons 
or even drones or skydivers instead what i saw were sparkling rings of smoke that had some 
shape and apparent structure but they spun like tops in the sky as they moved they almost had a jellyfish type body that seemed to pulse and was translucent
here's a very excellent and clear photograph of a ufo over lake tahoe lake tahoe is on the 
border of california and nevada and this photo taken here is actually a still from a moving film 
the witness says she took this on october 20th 2018 and as she says we went to lake tahoe for 
vacation we got a tour on a boat to ride on the lake i didn't see the object until we got 
home i was checking the video and this object appeared on the video it moved with great speed 
uh it appeared for about 18 seconds on the video and she provided the 18 seconds of video 
the entire video itself was about 10 minutes long and it does look like one person actually did see 
this object but all they know is that these photographs were taken on vacation 
and uh the lady said she had to reduce the speed of the video to about 20 to be able to actually 
see the ufo this next case occurred in the same year it was taken in december and this is also 
a moving film this is a still frame of several strange bright orbs which were filmed in the sky 
above mojave desert in california and according to the witness this was a quote major sighting 
clear video footage of light orbs in the desert disappear into the air they appeared suddenly 
out of the blue after a meditation at crystal hill at giant rock this is the last few seconds caught just before they disappeared it was stunning and beautiful 
following a group meditation as we walked down quartz crystal hill at giant rock in the mojave 
desert these light orbs suddenly appeared the next case i'd like to talk about i don't have 
a whole lot of information about it other than it was taken in january 2020 in woodville california 
and this photograph shows what appears to be a huge unidentified flying object in the sky 
the last case i'd like to present created quite a sensation on the internet when it was posted 
and this is actually from a moving film this was taken on october 30th 
of 2020 by a motorist who was walking along the 29 palms highway this is near mount san jacinto 
in the direction of palm springs california and it shows a very large glowing disc shaped ufo
again it's created quite a sensation this object has not been identified and appears 
to be your classic ufo so there you go those are 50 cases involving ufo photographs over california 
alone i did include a very small sampling of these in my book ufos over california but certainly not 
the whole list of 50 that i presented here and as you can see some of these are really 
quite impressive and i think very hard to debunk for example the battle of la in 1942 
there's no way you can say that didn't happen many other really good cases 
i think the case involving the photo of ufos over catalina island which is actually taken 
from moving films that took place in 1956 and was photographed by a professional photographer 
leland hansen very hard to debunk uh the 1959 photo by a navy pilot frank kinsey 
of a ufo over lake casitas i think that's a real good legitimate case there was other witnesses 
there he's a fantastic witness another case that is really hard to debunk or explain away is the 
case involving rex heflin in 1965 in santa ana these photographs are i think probably 
the best photographs taken in california and no one has ever been able to debunk those 
and many others i mean the case of john english in 1988 is another really good case so 
but i really wanted to present these photos to you today to show that there is in fact 
a lot of evidence in fact i think you could probably pull up the same number of photographs 
for each and every state in the united states and for that matter any location on this planet 
so yeah there is photographic evidence of ufos that's why i wanted to present this episode to you today i hope you've enjoyed it i want 
to thank you once again for watching i truly appreciate it and until next time keep having fun.
