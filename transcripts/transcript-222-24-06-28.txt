UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: BY SPECIAL REQUEST
Jun 28, 2024

Summary:
Jun 28, 2024
UFOs are seen all over our planet. It appears that virtually every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. But is this true? Recently a put out a challenge: name a location that you would like to know if UFOs have visited such as your hometown. The response was huge: many people asked if I could find any UFO cases in their hometown. So, by special request, this episode presents ten locations from across the United States (and a few outside of it,) and the history of UFO encounters that have occurred there. This includes sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids and of course, onboard encounters. Compelling evidence supports many of these cases including multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs, radar-returns, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more.

WENATCHEE, WASHINGTON. This history of UFOs in Wenatchee reaches back to at least 1907 when a strange airship was seen by multiple citizens. Following this, many other encounters occurred, including star-like objects, multi-colored UFOs, cone-shaped objects, shiny silver triangular-shaped objects, craft turning at right angles, and even a large object directly over downtown Wenatchee.

SIOUX FALLS, SD. One of the earlier Sioux Falls cases involved the sighting of a classic flying saucer moving overhead in July 1947. In 1954, police officers in Sioux Falls and surrounding areas saw UFOs. In 1957, police officer Jack Peters photographed a UFO as people all over the area witnessed strange activity. In 1976, UFOs were seen landing in Sioux Falls, and some reported seeing an actual ET. Even as late as 2018, UFOs continued to appear.

PAYSON, AZ. In July of 1969, a ranch family had a dramatic sighting of a classic flying saucer outside their ranch home. 1981, Sheriff Deputy Loyce Hamlin and 4 other officers reported UFOs. Hamlin had seen one before following a plane taking off from Payson. In the late 1980s, a Payson resident reported missing time while returning to his home. The sightings continued!

ALBANY, GA. In 1948, a pilot’s sighting over Albany was declared unidentified by Project Blue Book. More pilot sightings occurred in 1953 and in 1956. In 1968, Conway Jones reported a frightening encounter where a UFO disabled his car. In 1973, a flurry of encounters over Albany generated national headlines.

AALBORG, DENMARK. In 1963, a flying saucer landed next to a farmhouse in Aalborg. A human-looking ET came out and took the farmer onboard, right in front of his amazed wife. In 2006, 2009, and 2011, three more close encounters were reported, showing that Aalborg has been repeatedly visited by extraterrestrials.

VISALIA/TULARE, CA. In November of 1989, hundreds of residents in the area witnessed the now famous unexplained airships. Following this, encounters occurred regularly, including in 1952, 1979, and 2010. On January 1, 2022, a family had a close-up sighting of a UFO and captured three photos of the object hovering near their home.

PHILIPPINES. On March 8, 1968, more than 100 passengers on a jet over the Bashi Channel were amazed to see a UFO pacing their plane. A few months later, a mini-wave of sightings were observed by hundreds of people in the city of Manila. In November of 1968, four separate groups of witnesses observed a strange object with two human-looking figures inside. In 1979, a UFO was seen by many landing near Mount Apo. In 1991, a resident saw a UFO land near her home. ETs came out and started picking flowers.

ST LOUIS, MO. This city has many cases. A chiropractor reports his lifelong experiences with friendly ETs. In 1966, a UFO was seen landing at Point Pleasant Elementary school, and several students and one teacher saw an ET. Another case involves a dramatic sighting over a drive-in theater. And there are two other cases, one involving a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid, and another involving a landing.

OCALA, FL. Sightings here reach back to 1947 and occur regularly, including in 1952, 1955, 1957, 1968, 1974 and more. On May 14, 1978, a wave of sightings over Ocala was witnessed by dozens and was also seen and caught on radar at the Navy’s Pinecastle Electronic Warfare Range. The wave went on for months and generated national headlines and huge controversy. In April 2003, a woman reported a humanoid in her home which healed her of a problem pregnancy. The sightings continued.

WILMINGTON, NC. On April 6, 1897, hundreds in Wilmington saw the famous unexplained airships. More sightings of UFOs occurred in 1977 and 1980. In 1986, a couple had a scary encounter with a giant V-shaped craft. In 2001, a gentleman reported his terrifying encounter with humanoids in his Wilmington home.

These are just a small sample of the actual number of the documented cases coming from these ten locations. And these are just the ones which have been recorded. The fact is, most people don’t report their encounters. Have UFOs visited your hometown?

hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal today I'm going to do
something a little different I call this episode UFOs in your hometown by special
request I've often said that if you dig deep enough you will find that pretty
much every location on this planet has a long history of UFO encounters and I put
out a challenge a couple of episodes ago asking all of you to name your hometown
or a location where you'd like to see if there were encounters there and you did thank you I got a huge response more
than 50 of you replied so what I'm doing today is picking the first 10 people who
replied and doing a lot of investigating and digging and seeing if I can find UFO
Encounters in these locations and it turns out I was right I found a huge
number of UFO cases in all of these locations so the cases I've chosen today
are the most interesting it's certainly not all the cases that are in these locations because again there are so
many encounters but certainly some really fascinating sightings but not only that Landings face-to-face
encounters with humanoids and of course a couple of onboard experiences these locations are all
across the United States mostly but a couple outside of the United States so what I'll be covering today include
these locations s wachi Washington sou Falls South Dakota Pac
Arizona Albany Georgia alberg Denmark also V velia tari in
California the Philippines uh St Louis Missouri also
Ella Florida and Wilmington North Carolina quite a few locations there so
this is going to be a fairly long episode I tried to pick the most interesting cases but let's just get
started and the first location I am covering is wachi Washington this was
requested by IDs now so this is for you IDs now I hope you find this
interesting one of the first reports in wachi actually includes humanoids and it
appears to be connected to the very famous Airship wave of the late 1890s and early
1900s was the afternoon of September 16 1907 when a group of wachi residents saw
what looked like a dirigible moving swiftly across the sky they could see a cabin below it they could actually hear
music coming from it one of the witnesses a hunter used field glasses to
view it more closely and he said he saw two men and a woman of quote rare Beauty
the next day another strange Airship passed overhead at 700 a.m. causing a
huge uproar in the town were these human piloted ETS really this has never been
sufficiently answered the whole Airship wave remains a mystery but there are
more encounters here's a sighting from July 30 1952 was around 9:30 p.m. as a gentleman
who lived on Malaga Street in wachi saw a quote small starssized lights he said
they were moving in a crescent formation slow and silently across the sky towards
Twin Peaks and he was very much impressed as the witness says and I quote I know they were flying
saucers and here comes another case from a witness by the name of Estelle Elmer
who lived on Old Rock Island Road and he said that he and his wife and their
neighbors saw UFOs on an almost nightly basis throughout late August in 1959
what they were observing was usually a single sort of white yellow light but sometimes there were two or three of
them they called a news reporter who came out and he saw the lights himself
other people began to see them too they called the police a school teacher reported the object she saw which she
said had red orange and white lights there was a group of people in cashmere
who said that they saw one of these lights Dart upwards hover and then move across the sky so clearly not a balloon
or anything like that some of the reporters who looked into this actually called the FAA and the Air Force who
said that they knew nothing about it and that there were no known aircraft in that location at that time and the
sightings of course continued on the night of March 3rd 1972 Lonnie de Camp who lived at 2000
Skyline Drive in wachi said that he his family and neighbors saw a quote glowing
blue cone with lights coming out of the top in a fan shape there's some really
interesting cases of people who describe UFOs that look like ice cream cones straight off Close Encounters of the
Third Kind so they watched it for about 20 minutes even using binoculars before
it darted away at high speed and in fact as Lonnie de Camp says it's the craziest
thing I ever saw it doesn't act like an airplane or anything I've ever seen they
called the police who sent a car over but strangely the UFO left right before
the police arrived now I went to Newark the National UFO Reporting Center to do some
investigating there and there are almost a 100 cases which they have recorded in wachi
and almost all of these are anomalous lights but here's one involving a silver
metallic ship which was seen around 1: p.m. 1 August evening in 1979 and I'll just quote the witness who
says I was sitting on my front step just before full Darkness facing due north
when I happened to look up and saw a UFO passing directly overhead the object
appeared to be silver in color triangular in shape basically flat
underneath with clearly visible joints and rivets also visible underneath were
what appeared to be either lights or p holes lit from within the object was
extremely large and appeared to be quite close so he goes on to say that it was
slow silent had no wings while this does not appear to be a conventional craft
the fact that he believed he saw rivets points towards this craft possibly being
a reverse engineered human piloted craft hard to say for
sure now we move to another case which occurred on January 16
1980 the main Witnesses are Ted King he and his wife were in their home in wachi
when they saw a UFO hovering above Mission Ridge they called the police who said it
might be lights from the ski slope reflecting off of the ski slope not
surprisingly Ted King disagreed as he says it was at least 600 ft above
Mission Ridge it was clear as a bell he could see it clearly enough to see that it was
cylindrical it had a red light on it he said it hovered for 40 minutes and then
darted away at high speed as he says and I quote it was gone in a second or two
so clearly not lights reflecting off of the snow moving on to another case at 2:45
a.m. on September 28 1982 Warren Bonet and his mother
observed a glowing and puls red orange object from their home at 634 cus Street
they told reporters the reporters contacted the FAA who said it might be flares but Warren banet disagreed as he
says they weren't like flares he said that the these objects were three times brighter than Stars they would pulsate
one of them hovered in place while another moved horizontally and then downward and the other moved off into
the distance and dis appeared many sightings of anomalous
lights uh here's a really interesting case which I thought was important to include because of the way it maneuvered
it was on the night of April 4 2004 when a wachi resident saw a red silver object
in the sky and suddenly it made a 90° turn in the sky so clearly not a
conventional craft it was just five nights later that another Resident reported the same type of movement
movements now how about this this is an unusual case which is not quite a UFO
but certainly bizarre this is crypto Zoological I had to include it because
it's just so strange you can make up your own minds about it but one evening
in late December 2007 a man had a car accident in wachi police arrived the man
said that as he drove Northbound on wachi Avenue he saw what looked like a
quote pterodactyl fly overhead he was so stunned he lost control of his car and
drove into a light pole this is how the police were called they did test him for alcohol he had been drinking a little
bit but he was under the legal limit by far so I don't know he says he saw a
pterodactyl and if you look into that subject there are a lot of people who said they've seen these things I don't
know uh but that's cryptozoology and that's the only case included in this
episode today but I had to do it cuz it was so weird moving on to another case
date is not confirmed but it's probably around 2011 one evening at 2:30 a.m. when a man
and his friend saw a bright green sphere over East wachi they said it was pretty
big about the size of a truck and as they watched it darted straight up now
what's so interesting about this case is one hour earlier they friend told them
that she and several others had seen a huge silent craft metallic craft of some
kind solid flying over downtown wachi and the witness to this green
sphere didn't take her seriously until of course one hour later when he and his friend saw this other
UFO and here's one final recent case which occurred at 7:20 p.m. on July 20
2017 a man said he was driving along Sunset Highway and saw a quote large
silvercraft all silver like a mirror he said it was hovering in front of birch
Mountain muon investigated and they were unable to identify the craft as anything
conventional muan also has a number of cases in wachi so there you go that's a
brief upd history of UFOs in wachi Washington pretty amazing I couldn't
find any humanoid encounters I was pretty disappointed about that but certainly some really fascinating cases
stretching back a 100 years it's remarkable how long this has been going
on so now we move to the next location which is sou Fall South Dakota and this
is by special request from verpine so I found some really
interesting cases here mostly sightings what appears to be a landing as well a
really interesting photographic case as well just some really interesting cases
so I hope you find this interesting verpine and let's get started the first
case I could find in sou Falls occurred way back in July of 1947 very close to the time of the
Roswell UFO crash there was a huge superwave of activity going on at this
time and Gregory Zimmer of sou Falls reported his observation of a disc at
several thousand feet he said it was moving at very high speed to the Southwest it's a brief report but
certainly compelling and here's another case September 25
1954 I like this one because it involves police officers several patrolman
reported seeing a quote blue white ball which they said was moving in excess of
1,000 mph there were many others in the area who also witnessed it uh in fact
these were seen over a while wide area including Fargo sou Falls and into
Minnesota another very interesting case occurred a few years later in November 1957 when officer Jack Peters
photographed a half disk-shaped object just east of Pierre not too far from sou
Falls was also witnessed by patrolman Don kelm the Williston Herald wrote that
quote South Dakota is literally being invaded by flying saucer
state police radio said saucer posies saw at least 10 Monday night November
26th mysterious objects were reported at Redfield soue Falls Del Rapids Virgil
kuster hot springs and Pierre one witness from su falls Dennis reefers
said that he he was 10 or 12 years old the date is not given when he saw a UFO
with Port holes and with what might be beings inside of it as Dennis says we
got on top of the hill and heard something and looked up and saw a saucer-shaped object was right above us
it made a sound like a cutting of wind a whizzing sound it was spinning but there were Windows all around and you could
see something inside but couldn't see what because it was spinning moving on
starting around 11:00 p.m. on August 28th 1976 numerous people in sou Falls saw
clusters of red blue and white lights police officers also saw them too the
sightings went on till about 2:30 a.m. so hours one woman said a saucer
actually followed her car two boys reported their sighting of a tall figure
with a shiny blue uniform that appears to be connected to this mini wave of
sightings three deputies said that they saw an object actually land in a field 3
m north of Hartford but as they approached it quickly flew away so this
appears to be another example of what UFO researchers call a display sometimes
these UFOs are wanting to be seen now the National UFO Reporting
Center had almost a 100 cases from soue Falls I looked through them they were almost all anomalous lights perhaps the
most interesting to me comes from a middle schooler who said that on July 12
2018 he was coming home on the bus from Brandon Sue Falls when he saw three
flying discs they were flashing lights and he turned to tell the others on the
bus but when he looked back all the discs were gone and as he says I saw
three discs flying around that day and I am not crazy well this all was happening
I noticed that I felt sick to the stomach and got red blotches on my skin for a short period of time so there you
go some fascinating cases Landings um some physiological effects all kinds of
encounters it's amazing how many cases there are because I'm sure there are far
far more than the ones I've listed here you can consider this sort of an Abridged history of each location's
history of UFO encounters but now we move to the next location which is Pac Arizona some
really interesting cases in this one this is by special request of Daniel B
so thank you Daniel I hope you find this interesting I found quite a few cases uh
I couldn't find any real cases of humanoids though I have to say the Travis Walton case did occur not far
from Pac Arizona not specifically in PAC but yeah some really interesting cases
in this location for sure now here is a case from the National UFO report repor
Center they had about 20 cases in PAC and this is the only one involving a solid metallic craft was early July 1969
when three-year-old Jacqueline and her family experienced a close up sighting of a solid metallic UFO over their
secluded Ranch in PAC Jacqueline was just being put to bed when the entire
family noticed a very bright object hovering low in the sky above their home
in fact Jacqueline's grandfather shouted out what the hell is that and he rose
from his chair Jacqueline ran for the door but her grandfather stopped her and together they watched this disc-shaped
object it had large Square Windows or P Port holes around its side Each of which
was illuminated by a lemon yellow light every second or so the object would emit
a high pitched beeping sound and they watched it move in this slow gliding
manner cruising leisurely upward and as jacine says it was a dark night but we
could see that it was dis shaped by the illumination of its own light and apparently that created enough light to
cast around the object and allow us to see it Jacqueline's father upon seeing
it yelled out oh my God oh my God it's a UFO and began screaming for the other
members of the family to come outside and watch now if Jacqueline's father hadn't been holding her she would have
run towards it she said by the time the rest of the family arrived it was already moving away they did go outside
they searched the area all traces of the object were gone and even though she was only 3 years old she remembers it
vividly and she got some confirmation years later when she went to visit her grandfather as Jacqueline says I was
visiting him in his apartment in California with my mother when someone brought up the UFO subject and I made
the Casual remark like the one that Gramps and I saw and at that instant the
80-year-old old man jumped up and went nuts yelling you remember you remember so yeah a UFO sighting is often
a very memorable experience for people and here's another really interesting
case this occurred on the morning of January 6 1981 when Sheriff Deputy L Hamlin said
that he and two others observed four silver discs flying in a diamond
formation at about 10,000 ft altitude as he he says when they made a left turn
the sun would shine on them and they'd be clearly visible when they turned right they seemed to disappear so he
said they were silent metallic in appearance and he reported to UFO investigators telling them I never said
anything about it before because of what people might say he did admit to an
earlier sighting where he watched an object Pace a courier plane that leaves
PAC daily as he says I saw it come down and stay right above the plane for a
while and then it went up again and as it turns out later that same day and
evening January 6 there were several other sightings around Pac and the surrounding
areas now here's another case which comes from research Dongo in his book The Alien tide it occurred sometime in
the late 1980s when Bill Lewis was attending a series of seminars in
Phoenix and one evening while returning to his home in PAC he felt an
irresistible compulsion to drive outside of town unable to stop the car he found
himself about 50 Mi north of Phoenix on Highway 87 and suddenly he heard a voice
telling him to stop the car and as if in a trance he pulled over exited the vehicle walked away into a small Valley
became quite frightened as he says all of a sudden I got this incredible sense of fear I felt threatened the hair stood
up on the back of my neck and I felt a chill go up my spine I was
terrified and looking over his shoulder he saw a light and looking down into the
valley he could see that this Valley was filled with light and as Louis says was
almost like a tangible light like the light had substance the whole valley was
lit up with this incredible brilliant white light Lewis found that he was unable to move he could only
stand and watch and the next thing he knew he was driving home to his wife and kids in PAC and arriving home he
discovered he was missing more than three hours of time so this is your
classic missing time UFO encounter now here's a brief report
which occurred at 11:00 p.m. on September 29 1986 a gentleman reported his to cuos he
said he had run out of gas near Pac and was at the side of the road when he saw two flashing lights and he's looking at
them trying to figure out what they were when suddenly these lights veered towards his car and then sped away into
the night sky another report comes from muon they have about 13 reports for Pac this one
is probably the most interesting a man was at his friend's house in pacin which overlooks the East verie River her when
his friend shouted out oh crap looking outside they both saw a glowing object
about 20 ft away very low at eye level on either side of this were groups of
smaller lights so the reporting witness ran outside while his neighbor stayed inside
his home and as soon as the witness ran outside the object had disappeared but
his neighbor said that the object took off rapidly up the river he said he told
the witness that when he saw this object first arrived it looked like a plane was about to crash now later the witness
found out that his other neighbor also saw the same object as it moved up the river and other people also saw it as it
appeared on the Phoenix television stations about people seeing UFOs the night before I think you'll agree those
were some pretty fascinating accounts when someone has a very strong emotional
reaction to their encounter I think that's a good sign that this is something that was really out of the
ordinary and now we move to the next location which is Albany Georgia I found
some really wild cases I don't know how else to describe them one involving absolute
confirmation on radar some just overall super fascinating cases this location
was requested by Fringe so this is for you Fringe I hope you find these reports
interesting and yeah cases going quite far back all the way to 1948 up to pretty much the current day
now I didn't find any humanoid cases in Albany I did Cover a previous one in
another episode called Beyond bizar which is just a few miles to the north 30 or 40 or so in Pelham Georgia so you
might find that particular episode interesting but definitely some super
fascinating cases in Albany Georgia lots of cases in Albany one very early case
was declared unexplained by Project Blue Book and it occurred at 3:30 p.m. on
September 22nd 1948 this is near Turner Air Force Base
in Albany the main witness is Lieutenant Martin rubish he was flying at 2,000 ft
in a c47 aircraft when he saw a shiny metallic object with no wings or Rudder
approaching about 2,000 ft away at500 ft of elevation it quickly darted off Blue
Book researchers were stumped as to what it might be and declared it unidentified 5 years later 9:35 p.m. on
January 28th 1953 another pilot encounter a pilot was flying his f86
fighter jet in a training exercise Over Albany when he he encountered a brilliant white circular object he
approached it and the object grew larger started blinking white and red then took
on a triangular appearance and then split into two the object in the F 86
fighter were both tracked on radar in fact the f86 did a shallow attack dive
at the UFO and this UFO let the jet approach to a certain distance but no
closer always maintain a distance between it and the aircraft and uh after
about 3 minutes the object darted off at quote terrific speed so a pretty well
verified case on radar later that year August 15
1953 a citizen reported to a local Albany newspaper that he actually saw a
strange object maneuvering directly over the Albany Georgia airport there are
lots of airport Encounters in the literature here is another really interesting pilot
case 1956 pilot Don D Emerson was flying his
Piper Apache about 20 miles Northwest of Albany when he saw a large object with
Port holes was just hovering in the sky and sending down three beams of bright
light and as Don says it just seemed to sit there I turned on my Landing lights
for identification and the object vanished instant recently so a lot of
these are just sightings but here's one involving a close encounter of the second kind with weird electromagnetic
effects reported by Bank employee Conway Jones he called the police on the night
of November 22nd 1968 he was returning to Albany Georgia along Highway 91 when
he saw a fiery orange oblong object moving at Treetop level towards his car
and in fact it came right over his car car and hover this caused the radio to static and then the radio the car lights
and the engine all stopped uh needless to say Conway Jones
got out of his car and looked at the object for about 2 minutes at which point it turned red and shot up into the
air and out of sight a very dramatic encounter now the National UFO Reporting
Center lists about 15 sightings in Albany Georgia the most interesting I
think occurred one evening in June of 1971 when two people saw a solid craft
as one of the witnesses says to our wonderment this saucer-shaped craft was
performing Maneuvers above us at first it simply hovered about the height that
a small aircraft would fly maybe 1,000 2,000 ft up it made no engine noise
there was a row of what appeared to be Windows completely encircling the center edge as if two plates were placed
together with the inner sides facing each other these windows had vertical supports evenly spaced around the craft
like plate glass windows they glowed a deep Orange from inside the
craft so they were watching it then it shot off and was gone they said that the
sun rays were glinting off the edge of the craft it had a dark metallic color
and it moved three or four times then tilted at a 30 to 40° hovered and shot
away now moving on August to September of 1973 a flurry of sighting Over Albany
and surrounding areas caused waves at high levels of government and actually generated National headlines as numerous
Witnesses including State Patrol officers reported multicolored UFOs
zigzagging across the skies of Albany one of the reporters Susan shingler
reporter for the Albany heral said that she and police officers actually saw
these UFOs as she says two came flying across the sky there were six in all and
some were larger than others now Ray Smith a radio man said that he saw a dozen colored UFOs as
people called into his station to report these objects hovering and darting around so he went outside and he saw
them the sightings continued through September and in fact were reportedly photographed and
filmed the military was asked about them but refused to comment on whether they were even
investigating and researcher Stanton Friedman looked into these sightings and he believes the government was trying to
cover up what they knew the mutual UFO Network muon lists
about 13 cases Over Albany one of the most interesting was at 9:10 p.m. on
January 11 2008 when a husband and wife viewed 10 large lights performing
strange Maneuvers including circles and figure8 doing what they called quote a
lovely dance suddenly half of them shot off five remained they got off their
video and were able to shoot some video before these objects darted away
definitely some good cases there some real honest to God what would I call it solid evidence
proof If you like in terms of radar returns or electromagnetic effects
evidence of the government cover up it's clear our governments know exactly what's going on and if you can imagine
that the information I'm finding in these locations just imagine how much our government knows this is a real
thing this has been going on for a very long time and now we move to another location
and this is outside of the United States we are going to explore the UFO history of alberg
Denmark this request comes from helves so this is for you helves and I did find
some really amazing cases here including an onboard encounter um not a whole lot of cases so
this is a pretty difficult area for me as a researcher based in the US to
investigate but I found some and I think you'll find it fascinating I certainly hope so here is an amazing case
involving an on board experience it comes from the Danish UFO group UFO Dayton back the Witnesses are an elderly
Farm couple living in alberg they had sat down for dinner one summer evening
in 1963 when a disc-shaped object landed on three Landing legs in the fields by
their Farmhouse the husband was still holding his Fork when he ran out to investigate
and as he approached the desk a door opened up a ramp came down and a tall
human looking figure with long blonde hair stood in the doorway and invited the farmer to come on board now much to
his wife's fear and Chagrin this farmer accepted the invitation and went
inside the ramp retracted the door closed the object took off and the poor
wife immediately called the police now he was missing for 4 hours 4 hours later
while this Farm was swarming with police and military officials this disc landed
a door open the ramp came down the farmer came out very happy and excited
the disc of course immediately took off and for the next two days this poor
farmer was in interrogated by authorities and had to explain all about
his experience he was told by authorities not to discuss his encounter
and he publicly said only that once he was on board he was amazing to look outside a port hole or a transparent
section and he could see the Earth receding into the distance which really surprised him because there was no
sensation of any movement whatsoever so certainly a fascinating case of an
onboard experience I wish I had more info but there are more cases at 7:22
p.m. on September 3rd 2006 a witness was coming home from a
movie to his home in alberg and he saw a white circular object which he felt was
moving too slowly to be explained as a conventional craft as he says I think
it's kind of a UFO but I don't know 3 years later 2: p.m. February 12
2009 a lady described her sighting of a gray silver egg-shaped object hovering
ahead of her and as she says I was having a normal day out at the playground with my
17mon old son and my my husband as we were on our bikes heading home I was
looking up at the sky enjoying my time outside when I looked up I saw a silver
or gray looking round object not that big but big enough to wonder what the hell it could be I told my husband to
look up but he was looking everywhere but where I told him to look and by that
time it was so small that we could not see it anymore so unfortunately my husband did not get to see it I guess we
aren't wen't alone after all so one more case in alberg was just after 300 p.m.
on May 22nd 2011 that a witness described his sighting of a small black disc-shaped
object going from south to North as the witness says it was some unusual object
and not the usual flight SL balloon he actually was able to capture a glimpse
of it on his camera phone so I told you there were some really good humanoid
cases some close encounters and I wasn't lying it's true I'm pretty sure all of
these locations have cases involving onboard experiences they're much more difficult to find of
course much more difficult to verify and so forth but it's a worldwide phenomena
this is happening everywhere that's why I'm putting this episode out because people need to know
this every location has a long history of UFO and counters and now we're moving to another location which is velia and
tari these are neighboring cities and this was my special request
of probably on LSD so yeah probably on LSD this is for
you I hope you find this interesting there are cases stretching back a 100 years another interesting photographic
case as well so enjoy some very early cases in velia and tar and in fact they
were participants in the very famous Airship wave involving Zeppelin likee
craft it was late November of 1896 as hundreds of people in tari and velia saw
a quote Airship they said it had red green blue and white lights it moved
quickly at the speed of a train was going up and down right and left these
unconventional movements as it moved in the northwest towards the Coast Range mountains so
yeah the Airship wave remains an enigma to this day so it wasn't long before UFOs returned two visalians called the
Visalia times Delta newspaper to report their sighting of a dislike object on
August 19 1952 they said it hovered and flitted around along the Eastern Foothills in
fact over the next few weeks many more calls came into the newspapers of unexplained lights throughout the year
there were always more sightings on July 19 1979 the Vista press reported that
Jenny mcarter and Michelle Williams aged 17 and 16 said that they saw three
diamond shaped objects not far from the velia municipal airport they were alerted to the objects
by this loud humming noise and looking at them they saw that each object had four lights on them others in the area
did report hearing the humming noise and or saw the objects too Mario Lopez of
velia said that around 10 p.m. he heard this buzzing noise and looking outside
saw a gray disc-shaped object with four red lights on it it impressed him deeply
as he said I couldn't work the rest of the night after seeing that thing it was right on top of
us so muan of course has several reports one of occurred on March 27 2010 it's
quite interesting as the witness says I let my indoor cats outside to get some
fresh air while sitting in my chair I saw a silver object at first I thought
it was an airliner high in the sky as I had watched several across the sky earlier this was different the silver
disc-shaped object did not move in any direction for several minutes as I watched longer it seemed to
move very slowly to the left then St stop and moved back very slowly to its
original position as I watched I tried to consider what I was seeing I knew
this was not a balloon as it did not drift I was Facing East and the object
was Northeast at a 45° angle it seemed to be very high in the sky I would say
30,000 to 40,000 ft up I had the impression the object was spinning but
can't say for sure because of the distance so he watched for about 10
minutes went to get his wife and when he got outside it was no longer there but
as he says this was unlike anything I have ever seen I was very disappointed
that my wife missed it as it was very odd and he also said it had a polished
chrome appearance Now new Fork National UFO Reporting Center has more than 50
reports of UFOs in this area a very impressive case with photographic
evidence took place on the afternoon of January 1st 2022 as the witness says a reddish
orange spherical object was witnessed by my wife child and myself first from the
backyard and then the front this object not only moved in a way that no aircraft
or Pilot could possibly move speed direction Etc but also made absolutely
no sound at all our dog dog was barking heavily at it as well which was also
strange after defying all laws of physics it just disappeared so we
managed to capture three photos as you can see and he said it appeared to be a solid object with lights on it it would
change color and they could all see this weird aura or haze around it so it not
only looked strange moved strange it sounded strange as well these are the
three ear marks of unconventional objects there you go that's visel tari
California hope you found that interesting it's certainly just a small sampling of the cases there are a lot of
cases of people citing anomalous lights and I pretty much skip over those not because I don't think they're important
or legitimate but they simply don't have a whole lot of information to offer and
they're just not as fascinating as cases involving solid objects or Landings or some kind of effects or extensive cases
of that kind but there is a lot more than I'm presenting Here and Now we move
to another location this is the Philippines this is not a single City
the Philippines is quite large so this was a tall order and I pulled out some
of the more interesting cases that I could find from the Philippines I did just recently cover a very interesting
case from the Philippines involving a landing and humanoids which I'm not including here cuz I don't want to
repeat myself but I did find a bunch and this is by special request of sire gear
uh so I hope you find this interesting there are absolutely some really
fascinating cases of not just sightings but Landings and some humanoids as well
now the Philippines is huge there's more than 100 million people living there and 7,000 Islands so it should come as no
surprise that it does have a rich history of UFO encounters and if you want to look at the episode
not alone there is an interesting case involving Landings and humanoids but
there are many others at 3:15 p.m. March 8 1968 the crew and passengers of a Japan
Airlines conve 880 jet were flying over the Bashi channel in the Philippines at
about 9,500 ft suddenly the stewardess got on the microphone and told passengers and I quote we you can see a
white object of unknown nationality through our right Windows we've often
seen it on our regular flight so more than 100 passengers actually watched
this object which they described as white cylindrical and slightly higher than the jet it pasted it for about 5
minutes then darted off at high speed and it was later that same year
around 8:30 p.m. July 11 1968 that the area of Manila in the
Philippines had a wave of sightings many people including police saw three round
glowing yellow objects move over the city from Southwest to North in this
weird circular motion 2 minutes later three more UFOs flew over in that same
weird pattern and 2 minutes after that there was a third group of three objects
they all seem to just appear overhead moving to the north remaining visible for about 2 minutes before they suddenly
quote winked out yes a simple sighting but it was very widely viewed and quite
unusual now here is an amazing case involving humanoids this involves four separate
Witnesses who each independently observe what appears to be the same UFO piloted by human looking figures the first
witness was a farmer north of baras who at 400 a.m. on November 1st 1968
heard this weird hissing noise and saw an object with a red light descending he grabbed a flashlight and approached and
saw a white vehicle with a transparent canopy on top he said it was quote as
big as a Volkswagen Beetle car with two occupants he said it looked like it had
small wheels he could see six exhaust pipes at the rear each about as big as a
person's leg but the occupants inside were easily visible he said that they look like quote ordinary Caucasians they
were wearing white overalls with what looked like headphones he approached and he watched his object kind of roll
forward then take off vertically now in near silence and it was 2 hours later
that another Farmer in the area said that he saw apparently the same strange white vehicle with two people in it he
was frightened by its unusual appearance and reported it to the town mayor shortly after that at 8 8: a.m. another
group of witnesses a farmer and son saw this white object hovering over them in
Silence the fourth and final appearance of this thing occurred at 11:00 a.m. a
farmer was riding his bicycle came up a hill and saw a quote strange car had
landed nearby in this field so he's riding by it could see two quote very tall Caucasian men he said they were
wearing white coveralls just like the other Witnesses said one of these figures was sitting inside
the craft while the other was walking around it so the witness drove by and looking back he could see that one of
these figures was watching him closely he was frightened by this appearance suddenly he heard a loud roaring sound
and watched this object move up a hill then it started rise vertically at which point it became totally silent so was
this a reverse engineered human piloted craft it would appear so hard to say but
but there are other cases that are even more interesting an astonishing and very
widely viewed encounter took place on May 20 1979 over the Philippines highest
mountain it's called Mount Appo its elevation is 10,311 Ft an American scientist by the
name of Ron Kupa who worked for the film and research for the endangered environment he was there to study the
rare monkey eating e now this scientist Ron Kupa spoke with
reporters and he said that at 800 a.m. he and two of his assistants and more
than 600 residents of the upper barakan Village saw an object that was quote
perfectly round like a big balloon and as Ron says in his own words as I looked
into the sky to find out why the Eagles were making an eerie sound I noticed an
unusually bright star-like object in the north but almost directly
overhead he said a bright strobe like light came from the object he watched it with binoculars and he says he could
actually see movement inside the object then landed behind a cluster of trees
causing many of the villagers to flee in fear to their Huts the object remained there for about 20 minutes before taking
off and leaving the area an amazing sighting and here's another one
it was at 4:00 a.m. one morning in July of 1991 when a witness in bohall says he
saw a disc-shaped object with colored lights fly slowly over his home it circled twice around it and then it
landed on a nearby Hill so he approached this craft and saw that it didn't
actually land it was floating just above the ground and as he's looking at it after some time an opening appeared in
this craft a ramp came down and he saw two figures come out he said that they
were not human they had egg-shaped heads and what looked like quote malnourished
bodies they walked around the object picked some things off the ground he couldn't tell it was too dark uh they
then re-entered the craft which rose vertically and took off at high speed so a couple of hours later at first light
he went to the site and he saw a large circular area of burned grass and he
also saw that some of the purple flower that grew in that area had been pulled from the ground and were now missing I
love a lot of those cases I can only imagine what would be like to be inside a jet and have a UFO come flying along
pacing the jet and the stewardess shouts out look to your left here's another UFO
we see these all the time makes you wonder a lot of Pilots are seeing UFOs
and never report them a lot of really good cases of also involving Landings
apparently ly that one case involving apparent Landing traces and an ET coming out and picking flowers quite a few
cases like that I think a few of those might have been reverse engineered craft
piloted by humans very hard to say but judging from the details I think it's a
distinct possibility but certainly some really compelling
cases and now we move to St Louis this is by special request of JP prior St
Louis Missouri of course and I have to tell you this was a difficult research
project because the name St Louis is fairly common it was very hard to
research frankly I've covered a bunch of cases previously in St Louis so I'm
going to refer you JP to a couple of other episodes including one making
friends with UFOs another is School yard UFO encounters part two some really
interesting cases in St Louis there and a third episode I did called UFOs over
Drivin theaters uh there were a few cases of UFOs overdriving theaters in St
Louis Missouri but yeah I did find a couple which I'd like to share just a
couple I'm sorry about that my research I mean it wasn't always easy to find
cases uh because some of these city names are quite common and just it's a
huge research project doesn't always work out as I would hope but I certainly hope you find it fascinating so the
first humanoid case I found in St Louis dates all the way back to 1938 it comes
from researcher Bob Buck it doesn't contain a whole lot of information but what we do know is that a family with a
long history of UFO encounters the mother of this family says that she saw a flying saucer on the
ground with numerous entities rushing around it some of these were apparently
Grays one she said look like a 6ot tall woman with brown hair and brown eyes
human looking but wore a tight fitting onepiece uniform and she was walking
next to an apparent hybrid a little girl very fragile looking with large black
rounded eyes no whites but a very high forehead a pointed chin and very thin
fine hair again not a whole lot of information about that case but here's
another which occurred on May 13 1949 this comes from researcher Lee prer
in his book UFOs in Missouri a local woman who lived on the outskirts of St
Louis said that she was outside her home one evening when a gray alien just walked right up to her approached her
touched her arm and then ran away needless to say this was was quite frightening for her she said this figure
had strange eyes it looked unlike any person she had ever seen she was too
scared to scream or even really look at it as it moved off and in fact it took her some moments to finally run away her
memory of the encounter is a bit hazy so it's possible there's more to this but
she is unsure how long this humanoid touched her or even what it felt like so
I didn't cover sightings in that EP uh segment there just a couple of humanoid
en coners which I think are the most interesting uh it would take me a year
really to cover all the cases that are taking place in say a state uh I wrote
UFOs over California and New York and Arizona and other states and these were
all huge research projects so when I put out this challenge I didn't quite realize what I was getting myself into
but I said I made a promise so I am fulfilling that promise and trying to
find really good cases in each of these locations and the next location that was
chosen for me is ellaa Florida this is by special request of TGO Max and I'm
actually really glad you pointed out this location because I found some fascinating cases that I was not aware
of ones that provide absolute proof proof in my mind of the reality of the
UFO phenomena some cases that are really important that deserve to be widely
known so thank you TGO Max I hope you find this segment interesting CU I know
I did a very early Ella report comes from Mrs J harp who said that at 11:00
a.m. on March 30 1947 she was driving between Orlando and Okala and she saw
several silver discs appearing and dis appearing of course this was during a huge superwave it's a brief report but
certainly confirmation now on the early evening of August 8th
1952 Miss Leon Maxwell and her family were sitting on the porch of their home
located at 205 Southeast watula Avenue of course in Okala when they all saw two
UFOs flying overhead as she says the objects were orange in color one was
just above the other they made no sound she contacted the newspaper hoping to
find out if other people saw it cuz she is certain that whatever they saw it wasn't a plane and it wasn't a
reflection 3 years later another huge wave of sightings hit oala this was
October 31st November 1st 1955 dozens of flying saucers were seen
by numerous Witnesses including Levy County deputy sheriff ah Perkins who
said you couldn't tell what it was just a bright light it was awful bright but
there wasn't any sound first I thought it was Stars falling but then it went down and up leveled off picked up speed
and slow down no star does that a couple stopped where I had got out of my car to
watch and they said they saw the objects all the way from Perry so yeah this was a pretty major
citing couple of years later 1957 Dr CL quixley said that he saw a
number of strange kind of opalescent spherical objects over his home they
made this weird shrill sound circled around in a playful manner then moved off to the
southeast now here's a case which was investigated by Bluebook and declared unidentified it occurred 12 Mi west of
Okala at 9:30 p.m. M on September 15 1968 it involves pilot Ray Cole who was
flying at 9500 ft with his passenger Ray rushing and they both saw this green and
white light moving up and down turning and climbing upwards and as they're
watching it a second identical light appeared and it made a 90° turn then
descended so blue book was not able to figure out what this was and declared it
unidentified and of course the sightings continued one evening in late October
1974 Butch Buford said he was driving from Salt Springs to his home at
Northeast 12th Court in Okala when he saw this weird red object in the sky as
he says was able to go at a terrific speed then turn sharply in the other
direction planes cannot do this as it turns out Butch Buford had been studying
UFO for about 3 years and he had a friend who had built a UFO detector
which works on the process of detecting magnetic fields cuz these craft
apparently do give off magnetic fields so Bush rushes home and the two of them
took this detector out into the backyard and after 10 minutes it started going off and sure enough shortly later an
object streak overhead so Butch Buford called the police who said that they had in fact
received three reports from other people reporting unusual activity in the sky in
that area now the biggest UFO event in Okala
history occurred on May 14 1978 when numerous people in the area
started reporting UFOs now at the time of the sightings there was a dozen Personnel at the
Navy's Pine Castle electronic warfare range and they also saw these objects
and tracked them on radar are because they were actually receiving calls from Witnesses they said that one of these
objects actually hovered and then turned abruptly and sped off at such a speed that radar couldn't follow it one of the
witnesses was radar man Timothy Collins who said that this object was moving so
fast that while they did see it on the radar screen they couldn't lock in on it
as he says it did not perform like any aircraft I've ever seen before on a radar scope first it was heading south
then it was heading north planes just don't have a ra turning radius like that
the way it moved it was very abnormal I've never seen anything like it and I
don't want to see anything like it again Lieutenant Commander John Sullivan
spoke with reporters and he told them yeah the computer wouldn't handle it so
these officers were alerted to the sightings when citizens began to call them to report UFOs one woman first
called asking if they were dropping flares which they denied then another man called in and said that he and seven
others were on State Road 19 when an object about 50 ft in diameter covered
with lights flew right over their vehicle officer Robert J Clark was
Fielding these calls he worked at the Navy's Pine Castle electronic warfare
range and he says after receiving these calls and I quote we got got out the
binoculars and went up to the tower we located an object due north approximately 1,500 ft above the trees
we watched it for 15 or 20 minutes and it looked like it was pretty stationary we locked in on it on radar
and then all of a sudden it was gone I can't explain what it was didn't seem to us like an
aircraft and soon there were more objects appearing on the radar screen some of these were seen visually some
weren't but there were at least three sightings that night detected by the base and as officer Robert Clark says
afterwards we sat around and talked about it so as news of this sighting
spread more witnesses surfaced one was John Nunley a pilot who after seeing a
UFO tried to call the police and Navy for answers and basically got the runaround as he says I was pretty upset
about it I mean I'd really seen something and all I wanted to do was find out if there had been other
reports now another witness was Rocky Morgan and it turns out he was the one
who called the Pine Castle base and as
Rocky says it was up in the air straight over us he and eight other residents
including Billy Tatum were in Ocala's silver Glenn Springs area and watched
this object for about an hour and again he said it was 50 feet in diameter oblong in shape had a bright pulsating
light was low enough at times to disappear behind the trees and actually seemed to land in the forest so he
called about it wouldn't leave his name as he says I wanted to keep my mouth shut because I didn't want anyone to
think I was stupid now that I called Pine Castle and though go those guys have seen it too I don't feel so bad he
did first try calling the sheriff but the Sheriff's Office weren't as
interested and they act like he was quote drunk or crazy another person at the base a
watchtower guard by the name of John Falcon Haagen he says he saw this object
both visually and on radar and as he says I have never seen a radar act so
crazy spinning around and around up and down that night we were told not to talk
to anyone about this by the commanding officer so they tried to cover it up but
clearly couldn't another witness who is anonymous said that they encountered the craft they said they saw the solid craft
no more than 20 or 30 feet away they actually drew it they said it looked like four cylinders connected by tubes
another witness was Jason Leonardo rapael Perez DEA who also provided an
illustration and he was so impressed he ended up years later uh devoting a whole
Facebook page to this wave of sightings and in fact these sightings didn't stop
on that night they continued for some months on May 15th the crew of the tugboat Lisa C saw a domed disc with 8
to 10 square Port holes below Treetop level in November of
1978 a man called the local newspaper to say he saw a quote ball of fire he said
it was over his home around 1:00 a.m. with silvery white and color hovering at low altitude and then started Zipp
around and like others he just wanted to know if there were other
Witnesses 10 n oh well that's the one you pulled on
me now it's payback time oh what's up you ain't going to believe this one we
think we think we may have come up with the answer for it so just hang with us
we'll let you know if you want to head up towards the railroad tracks around Citra
uh-huh have you had a lot of power outage out there that you know of tonight not I know of well we had some
reports of power outage for McCoy GOI Prairie bide
Etc lakes and Meadows this is signal 14
possible repeat possible UFO sightings hey he Co this is by two
different people I was just over there uhhuh oh wonderful man what the hell I
do with it she sucking I don't know okay you 1044 you best get the damn
Air Force out England Air Force May scramble already alert I tell you what D got a
got his ass crack big crack and year after year sightings
continued in Okala on the evening of June 17 1987 the local sheriff's office
said that they received four calls from the Okala area one of the witnesses was a deputy and according to spokesman Ken
Engle this Deputy quote saw it hovering over the tops of the trees like it was
following the railroad tracks we now know that this officer was Jay manifold
and he said that this object was about the size of a car and totally silent another witness was Wanda Lasher
and her family who saw this object move real slow right over their car while
driving along Pine Church Road along with Wanda were Stephanie
James and her children they all watched this object for about 10 minutes but decided to leave when this object
started to move too close for comfort and as words spread more witnesses came
forward Rob doll and Alan stoff said that they were camping at Lake farl and
saw an egg-shaped object object over a 3-day period Gillette Shram said that
she and her family saw this object right over their car Joe Fitzpatrick said he
saw this object Zoom at him make a right angle turn less than a quarter mile from his home a lot of witnesses another was
Dale Kitz who set a cigar-shaped object about 10 ft long 6 feet wide hovered
right over his neighbor's cornfield and this was during the day 10:30 a.m. hours
for most of these sightings another witness was Lewis Stevens who said that on June 23rd at
11: p.m she heard this whooing sound and looking outside saw an object with Port
holes that actually landed in her front yard she said it was quote whitish
metallic said it was about 6 feet tall disc-shaped and it quickly darted away
it left a section of dead grass on her long she actually called the police while it was there they put her on hold
and left her there apparently they weren't interested she was too afraid to go outside and look at this thing and
she said after about 20 minutes she heard the same whoosing sound looked out and the object was
gone now there is a case involving humanoids that was reported to muon this
was one evening in April 2003 when a pregnant woman said that she woke up
around 2 a.m. unable to move and this happened over several evenings
at the time she was having some bleeding problems with her pregnancy and then one night she said she woke up unable to
move and saw a 3ot tall figure who to her shock looked kind of like an old man
she didn't think alien at first all she knew was that she says he did not look
like anything I had seen before and she fell back asleep but in the morning she
discovered something quite unusual as she says after the experience I stopped bleeding and I am now super interested
in physics and science I feel as if I were woken up so she was apparently
healed and like many contactees develops an interest in all
kinds of really deep subjects she says that her son who she was pregnant with
at the time is now having experiences and so is her daughter and she herself
began having more experiences she feels they're positive as she says I get the
feeling that whatever I have dealt with is positive in nature although it scares me to death to think of seeing one
again super interesting just a couple of more in Okala on January 15 2005 at 7:30
p.m. a witness was driving South on Highway 301 and saw two unidentified
objects right over Okala as he says I watched the objects hovering as I drove
as I turned South on I75 the red lighted object flying left to right in front of
me flew directly over the highway with a very small white object blinking to the right three to six multiple white
blinking objects began blinking right over I75 then suddenly he says these objects
rocketed down and towards him forcing him to actually slam on the brakes so he
was quite stunned by this and looking up he counted about six of these objects flying in different directions as he
says I'm convinced they weren't airplanes blimps or helicopters he ended
up reporting his sighting to Newark they do have several that's one of the most interesting muon has some as well uh one
of the more interesting ones occurred at around 3:03 a.m. on May 1st
2021 when a witness said that she saw a giant Fireball like object come across
Lake George St and then revealed itself to be a solid object she said it was huge like five
stories tall she saw what looked like weird spires on top she says it remained
there for about 15 minutes absolutely stunning her then it lit up and moved
off and this is when she realized she should wake up her boyfriend which she did and he got up in time to see it as
it moved off so there you go TGO Max a history of Encounters in Okala Florida
there's quite a few a lot of sightings but some Landings as well some humanoids
some interesting evidence Landing traces and so forth this subject is just
endlessly fascinating there's so many cases and now let's move to the next
location now first I want to apologize to one of you ashes to ashes CU you put
out a request for uh loc sightings and Encounters in Warren Pennsylvania it
turns out there are so many locations named Warren I just kind of threw up my hands in defeat trying to find cases in
that specific area I did find some but they were pretty much anomalous lights I
just didn't find them interesting enough to include here I'm not going to totally give up so if you're patient I'll try
again but I had to move on to the next location which is Wilmington North
Carolina and I did find a lot of cases here this was requested by B need and it
was difficult but I found some really interesting cases which I hope you find
interesting as well so Wilmington is the last location I'll be covering today uh
I found quite some interesting cases and turns out Wilmington was also a participant in the famous Airship
wave on April 6th 1897 according to the Sunday Star News quote
hundreds of people were out on the streets and Wares last night looking at a brilliant floating mass in the Heavens
to the west of the city it was moving rapidly and many persons saw Network
about the aerial wonder some of our very best and most reliable citizens saw so
much of the Heavenly stranger that they had not the slightest doubt that it was the Airship which had been reported from
other cities the ship moved to the West at a rapid rate
it seemed to have something of a search light facing Eastward and created a sensation among all classes of people
the ship appeared to come from the ocean and passed opposite the Market Street dock going in the direction of the NASA
guano Works some gentlemen who saw the ship through field glasses informed us that
they could see wires and ropes and rigging about it again a very weird
series of events that Airship w but there were other sightings in Wilmington another really interesting
sighting occurred on July 20 1977 and get this the witness is Miss
James Kirk no relation to Star Trek she insists but she lived at 513 Greenwood
Road in Wilmington and she told the Wilmington Star that she and her neighbor saw weird quote blinking lights
she was very smart she ran inside and got her teenage children outside to see it and as she says we went back out in
the yard and this thing was coming towards us you could see it was totally Round And as large as an airplane it got
within 150 yards of us over the top of the pine trees but there was no sound
whatsoever it had no definite pattern it would fly forward then it would go sideways but it never got out of sight
after 30 minutes it flew behind a giant pine tree and disappeared 3 years later on the evening
of March 10 1980 John Johnson was driving through Wilmington when a loud object came right
over his car and Shone down a brilliant light as he says it sure scared me it
was something that sounded like an airplane I had my little dog in the car with me and he started howling like it
was hurting his ears I thought the thing was going to crash on me and I got out of the car it just lit up everything
around me the light was so bright I couldn't see what it looked like so this
object whatever it was was overhead for about 10 seconds before suddenly taking
off very quickly and moving out of view he doesn't think it was a helicopter because it sounded quite different
couldn't have been a plane but it upset him enough that he called the police and later spoke with reporters 6 years later
7:45 p.m. January 6 1986 a couple had just finished having
dinner and Wilmington and were driving to Hampstead along Highway 17 when a
strange group of Lights appeared about 400 ft overhead they said it was Boomerang
shaped huge about as big as two football fields so the husband stopped the car
and got out to watch and his wife said it just came over real slow I believe it
was the most terrifying feeling I've ever had in my life I caught myself trying to hide from the lights behind
him I begged him to get back in the car but it was like he was mesmerized it
scared me so bad I cried it left me with an uneasy feeling a very humble feeling
I did not want to see anything like that again but 3 or 4 days later I would have
given anything to see it again I find that interesting first
she's scared and then she wants it to come back all right new Fork they have a lot
of reports in Wilmington over a hundred one did involve humanoids it occurred
one evening in August 2001 the witness was sleeping in an upstairs bedroom when
a bright beam of light entered right through his window he looked at the clock saw that it was 2:37 a.m. and as
he says soon after three Silhouettes were standing in my room around my bed I
was unable to move at all due to an outside force acting on me for approximately 10 minutes the Silhouettes
continued to stay pretty still with only slight movement though they seemed to be communicating
somehow as fast as they appeared they disappeared and I sat up in bed the
encounter was very frightening for the witness and two years later he reported it to the National UFO Reporting Center
because as he says this event has haunted me ever since so there you go
cases reaching back more than a hundred years in Wilmington North Carolina a
humanoid case as well some really compelling cases so thank you B need for
picking that location I found it fascinating to find all of these cases I
really want to thank all of you because it's just super fascinating to me to
find all these cases in all these different locations all over the world I'm fascinated by both the similarities
and the differences in each account and I've said it many times but each and every case has something to teach us
about UFOs about the ETS why they're here what's going on and all the
questions surrounding this subject so thank you thank you thank you and while
I do have still 40 plus locations that I want to cover I'm inviting any of you
who haven't already given me a location to give me one name your hometown give
me a specific location and I'll put it on my list and I'll do a future episode episode on the history of UFOs in that
encounter and again I'm going to focus mostly on those cases which have
something to offer in terms of what's going on you know something more than
just an anomalous light something that can provide information some insight
into the nature of the UFO phenomena why they're here the more interesting cases and specifically those of humanoids and
onboard experiences and landings that kind of case because those are the ones that do have the most information and
those are the ones that I think really will lead to answering what's going on
here so that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this slightly different episode
there will be more forthcoming so thank you for watching I truly appreciate it it's because of you
guys I do all of this hard work and it takes a lot of time trust me it takes
quite a bit of research but I'm having fun I hope you are too so until next time keep asking those hard
questions keep searching for the truth and most important of all keep having fun and I will see you next week bye for

remote control on the power lines and I don't not sure the whole
thing but they can track that sucker and find out where breaking the line is M it does have red light on one side green
light on the other like a boat does has a headlight that points ahe one that points down to the ground and it a Miss
