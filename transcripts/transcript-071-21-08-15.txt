UFO INVESTIGATOR'S DISEASE
Aug 15, 2021

Summary:
Aug 15, 2021
It is well-known among UFO investigator's that there is a contagion factor with UFO encounters. If you associate closely with a UFO contactee, this greatly increases your own chance of having a UFO encounter.

As a general rule, UFO researchers try to remain objective, which guards against distorting the evidence with a one's personal viewpoints about the phenomenon. However, by jumping into the middle of an active UFO case, UFO researchers run the considerable risk of losing objectivity by becoming involved in the events as they happen. And sooner or later, this objectivity can be completely shattered when the UFO investigators become, in turn, investigated by UFOs.

It is a clear-cut case of the hunter becoming the hunted. The extraterrestrials are able to turn the tables with startling ease, and overnight a UFO investigator can be transformed into a UFO abductee. And this has, in fact happened to several UFO researchers who have plunged headlong into cases involving UFO abductions.

This also works in the other direction. Many UFO witnesses are so impressed by their own encounters, that they themselves begin to investigate UFOs, sometimes becoming highly influential in the field of ufology. In some cases, researchers believe they were destined by the ETs to become involved in investigating UFOs.

This is the phenomenon known as "UFO Investigator's Disease." A surprising number of researchers suffer from this condition. Many have gone public, however, others are keeping this a secret. And others might be completely unaware that they themselves have been contacted by aliens!

What happens when a UFO researcher contracts UFO investigator's disease? Does investigating UFOs truly run the risk of attracting UFOs? How many researchers suffer from this condition?

This video presents twenty cases of "UFO Investigator's Disease." You just might be shocked to see the names of the prominent researchers who have found themselves the target of UFOs.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to another episode of ufos in the paranormal I have a fascinating episode for you today I call this episode ufo investigators 
disease there's a little secret going on in the ufo community that you might not be aware of 
and that is that many ufo researchers are themselves in contact with ufos 
often a ufo will be inspired to become a researcher as a result of an encounter 
but just as often a researcher will start researching ufos and then have an encounter 
it appears as if ufos are researching ufo researchers this is definitely a thing 
i mean it actually happened to me I have caught ufo investigators disease and that's what this 
episode is about the many many researchers who are having contact with ufos either before 
or following their ufo investigations the first researcher I want to talk about is brad 
steiger brad steiger is very well known in this field he's written a number of books but what a lot of people don't know is he has had a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials 
it was an october night in 1940 and brad steiger was just a little kid in his home in iowa 
when he heard weird footsteps and sounds outside he jumped up looked at his bedroom window and 
was shocked to see an alien ah he knew instantly this was not a human as he says I could see his 
very large round skull two pointed ears and long slender fingers as they grasped the window cell 
he saw enormous slanted eyes with their vertical reptilian pupils this e.t looked right at him 
they locked each other's gazes and the next thing brad steiger knew is he fell asleep he had missing 
time next thing he knows he's waking up the next morning but it impressed him deeply as he said 
a seed had been activated within my psyche no amount of adult persuasion could alter 
my personal experience we were not alone in the universe there were other intelligences 
walking about who resembled us who seemed curious about us and who might even care about us in some 
way and years later as an adult brad was visiting an art show about ufo art and came upon a painting 
which depicted the e.t he had seen as a child down to exact minute detail he confronted the artist 
her name is shannon reed and learned that she lived in a neighboring town in iowa and had 
an encounter with what was apparently the same creature around the same time it's stunning confirmation but the point here is brad steiger's research into ufos was sparked 
by a ufo sighting is this a coincidence i'm not so sure because there are a lot of cases 
and sometimes ETs will come after a person starts researching ufos and that's what happened to dr 
laurie vassos who was a very prominent physician in canada and in 1992 he stepped forward and said 
that he was in contact with ufos this came about as a result of him wishing for it as he said 
i wanted to have an experience because I was investigating it and then in july of 1989 while 
in wyoming dr vassos had his first ufo experience as he says and I quote while I was sleeping I 
had some sort of out of body experience and encountered this being it was a humanoid it 
wasn't a gray fellow and shortly after this he had another and another he had a bunch of them as he 
says i've had a series of them I have had several other encounters in which I was taken abducted 
and this was actually quite scary for him he doesn't think that they are negative or evil 
but it did startle him quite a bit and that's when he went public saying that he had been abducted by 
extraterrestrials and this is as a direct result of him investigating ufos I think this is exactly 
what happened to bill hamilton bill hamilton is a very well-known researcher who's looked into 
area 51 and other government complexes perhaps best known for researching the phoenix lights 
he wrote a book about it and in on march 16th 1993 bill and his wife pam also an experiencer 
decided that they were going to visit area 51 to see if they could see ufos and they did an orb-like object approached them it changed into a disk then went back into an orb 
and as it swept past them suddenly bill found himself facing the opposite direction and he was 
missing about 20 minutes of time he had had missing time and so he and his wife both decided 
to go under hypnosis which they did the very next night and under hypnosis he saw that this orb of 
light actually transformed into a disc uh right as it approached his car it stopped sent on a 
beam of light sucked him on board on board he saw a six foot tall gray type e.t wearing a gray suit 
with a triangular symbol on the side he had long arms four fingers on each hand he asked about 
his wife the e.t said his wife was outside bill hamilton asked the gray why he had been 
abducted and the gray said that bill needed an adjustment and that he would learn some things 
bill was physically examined he saw computer-like tables which displayed his thoughts and emotions 
that's what he believed the being said his name was quelar it was a pretty short standard 
abduction experience bill was then returned back to the ground and woke up both he and his wife 
saw a car driving away it was totally silent and uh pamela his wife went under hypnosis 
and she recalled seeing bill being taken on board she saw grace standing around she said she saw 
a military van a short distance away watching the abduction take place she was approached by 
military personnel who actually detained her in the van during the abduction and then she was 
let go and the ET's returned her husband bill the car drove off the ET's moved off and that was that 
but yeah this is another case where ufo investigators are being in turn investigated 
by ufos and it's not unique this is exactly what happened to richard boyland richard boyden is a 
prominent investigator he's written a number of books such as one called close extraterrestrial 
encounters he did have an encounter as a kid in his home in oregon involving a metallic disk but 
it was a simple sighting he didn't believe he was abducted or involved personally in any way 
but he certainly was interested in ufos and in 1992 he had an incredible experience 
he was driving across the country visiting areas like area 51 in sandia labs and other 
government installations which had been implicated with highly advanced technology 
perhaps reverse engineering this sort of thing and it was on april 12 1992
that boylan was driving north on highway 180 between deming and silver city in new mexico when 
he drove into a fog bank or what thought might be smoke it was so thick he had to stop the car 
he got out of his car and next thing he knows somebody is grabbing his arm he couldn't see who 
and pulling him towards this craft this craft was not large maybe 35 feet long he said 12 feet high 
and he was pulled in through a door and on board he saw gray type ETs they were short 
with dark oval eyes no pupils or irises just pure black no real nose or mouth uh very thin 
about five feet tall he was placed in a dentist like chair and he felt them sort of 
sticking something up his nose up in his sinuses he believes he was probably implanted 
and uh next thing he knows he's being floated out of the craft horizontally and back into his car 
and he's driving out of this fall fog bank and the whole experience left his mind he didn't remember 
any of it all he remembered was the soreness in his nose driving into the fog bank with 
vague memories of being pulled out of his car and having missing time he did recognize that 
and uh he later had more ufo sightings during this trip he went home decided to go under 
hypnosis himself and under hypnosis recalled this whole experience and he believes that this 
was intentional and that this was a result of his own interest in ufos and his work with abductees 
as he says and I quote I think I had an encounter with some non-earthly folks whose 
craft was by the side of the road they seemed very benign and left me numbers for the wear 
when I got back in my car and finished my journey subsequently the other thing I got from this 
trip and I suspect from that experience is a real sense of urgency to get out the message about the 
government's secret saucer program and their very current star wars agenda i'm beginning to think 
this urgent agenda to get this information out may be part of the message I got at their hands 
following this he also noted a number of paranormal and psychic events which seems to be 
related so maybe the ET's know what they're doing here because look at what happened to mainstream 
journalist ed conroy ed conroy was a texas based journalist who decided he was going to investigate 
whitley strieber's case and find out if it was a hoax or if it was real whitley strieber agreed and 
ed conroy soon discovered that whitley's case was real he called whitley the typhoid mary of 
ufo contact because it seemed like everyone around him started to have contact at some point and ed 
conroy didn't realize when he began investigating ufos that he himself would be investigated by ufos 
but of course that's exactly what happened and it started with black helicopters buzzering over his 
home he believes his phone was tapped he was under some type of surveillance as he says call it ufo 
researchers disease or what have you the complex of experiences I have had in their general outline 
is well known in the ufo community his real big confirmation of this came in july of 1987 
he was in his home he bolted upright in bed absolutely convinced that someone was in his house 
next thing he knew he had missing time and he's waking up the next morning 
and he found a big spot of blood on his pillow and that absolutely convinced him 
that he was now a target of the ETs himself and it scared him as he says 
i even considered dropping my plan to write a book on strieber and the visitors since I had to 
consider the thought that perhaps my capacity for objectivity had somehow been violated after all 
few people who write about ufos from an investigative angle ever mention having had anomalous personal experiences to do so might well seem to one's 
readers that one had somehow become contaminated by the subject and he was right certainly at that 
time not a lot of researchers were admitting to being contactees but in fact that's the truth 
many of them are having experiences with ufos but are not talking about it
he decided to go public as he says I have come to see myself not only as an investigative reporter 
but also a participant observer in the style long adopted by anthropologists who study tribal 
peoples he wrote his book report on communion which gave a positive conclusion that whitley 
strieber's experiences were actually happening as ed conroy says I dislike lying and I refuse 
to subject myself to the negative psychological effects that would result from making a secret 
of this material objectivity that does not honestly deal with subjective elements isn't 
worth much to anyone I think one of the most dramatic cases of this time of this kind comes 
from very prominent ufo researcher raymond fowler raymond follower is best known for investigating 
perhaps the betty andreason case or the allagash iv he's a huge influence on this field 
and had always been interested in ufos but he didn't know why people would ask him why he researched ufos and he just said his interest was so strong 
that he called it near fanaticism but he had no reason to think he was personally involved until 
the spring of 1980 when he was listening to betty andreasen relive her encounters under hypnosis 
and he himself started to have powerful flashbacks of aliens entering his room strange figures 
he once he recalled a powerful beam of light coming to his room and seeing a figure floating 
on the beam of light coming into his room he saw small balls of light whizzing around he had 
a number of close up sightings of solid metallic craft so after getting more than a dozen of these 
types of experiences and these powerful flashbacks increasing in vividness he decided that he himself 
would go under hypnosis and to his shock he discovered that he was in fact an abductee 
under hypnosis he recalled being taken on board a craft and on board the craft he
saw beings there he was taken to a window and he looked outside of the window and saw saturn 
he said it looked as if it was right in front of him close up and in real life 
and while inside the ufo he was told by these ET's that in the far future he would be helping people 
and while this was recalled under hypnosis and is you know what he remembered he does have physical 
proof or evidence at least on august 17th 1988 he discovered a strange scoop-shaped scar on his leg 
identical to those of many abductees he had studied he showed it to his doctor who told 
him it looked like a punch biopsy which is done by humans for obtaining tissue samples 
and after studying his close encounters he came to the conclusion that they were probably preordained 
in some way predetermined so that he would become a ufo researcher as he said if I did 
have such contacts I believe that I may have some linkage to the andreas in affair the entity 
that I encountered indicated that I had been chosen to do something significant for mankind 
could it be possible that I have been chosen to record their message for mankind 
so yeah I mean that's a good question is this being done by perp on purpose did the ETs know 
when raymond faller was a little kid that he would be researching the andreason affair 
it looks like it hard to say but there are many many cases like this look at what happened to ann 
druffle and ruffles best known for writing the tahunga canyon contacts 
and another book how to protect yourself against alien abduction and another book about 
researcher james mcdonald called firestorm she's very prominent in the field and 
turns out she did have her interest in ufos sparked by an early childhood sighting 
uh it was 1945. she was just a little girl living in long beach and she was with her mother when 
quote I saw an object or a greasy blob of golden light in the clear blue sky 
it then released 15 to 20 smaller shiny objects which took varying paths out and away from the 
main object there were little tiny bits that came out of the craft but didn't fall to the earth 
it frightened me so this is what we would call a ufo display I think it intentionally 
wanted her to see it that's just my assessment because there are so many cases like this 
and perhaps it was intentional that they did want her to see it and that they knew she would become a ufo researcher because this is the pattern that keeps turning up 
i mean look at what happened to edith fiore phd edith fiore is best known for her work 
into past lives and possible spirit possession and she used hypnosis to treat her clients 
and it was while she was using hypnosis to treat her clients that she started to run into people who had actually been taken on board a craft and this really intrigued her by the way edith fiore 
is the first person with a phd to write a book about people who've been taken on board her book 
is called encounters I definitely recommend it at any rate while she was doing all this 
research she became very intrigued about the possibility of having her own encounter and 
began to send out what she called mental messages and please hoping for a sighting or a message and 
it was around this time that she had a very vivid dream that she was taken on board a ufo 
and she says writing about the dream my hosts treated me as an honored guest and colleague 
i sensed that they were humanoid not the least bit frightening or strange she only remembered a few 
bits of this dream and assumed it was just a dream how ever later she did go under hypnosis with 
researcher james harder phd and found out that she was in fact a contactee as edith fiore says 
we quickly discovered that I indeed had been contacted I had been floated out of the bedroom 
in my condominium in los gatos california into a spaceship once there I was treated 
with respect and kindness and much was explained to me that I was not to remember until later 
then it would filter into my mind more as memories than his knowledge and would be very helpful to me 
so she felt some ambivalence about this recall but it was a month later when she really started 
treating ufo abductees professionally as a psychologist and in the next few years she would 
counsel nearly 50 people who have had onboard experiencers and become a leading researcher so I 
don't know if this is coincidence because it keeps happening look what happened to dr roger lear 
who is best known for his research into removing alien implants he wrote a best-selling book 
called aliens and the scalpel about his research into alien implants and he himself believes he may 
have had an encounter this began with a dream where he found himself in a court-like setting 
there were chairs and tables and weird diffuse lighting and he was shocked to see several figures 
file into the room and sit down in the chairs and he says each of these figures was under 
four feet tall and wearing shiny silk like garments which wrapped around their bodies 
each had a sash belted about the waist he said and a hood thrown over the hood and draped over the 
shoulders and one of these beings talked to him and gave him a message saying and I quote so you 
want to know the secrets who do you think you are to ask this of us why do you persist in your quest 
and they gave him more messages which he couldn't quite understand next thing he knows he's hearing 
a loud whirring sound which is so loud that he woke him up and he was back in bed and he wondered 
if this was just a dream because it was so bizarre and then he had heard the sound and then he found 
evidence that perhaps it wasn't a dream as he says and I quote my next conscious thought 
was that of being back in my room in bed and lying next to my wife my daughter had climbed into bed 
with us and was sitting straight up staring at me I must have had a surprised expression on my face 
she leaned over and whispered in my ear daddy where were you I thought I was going to have 
an instant heart attack what in the world did she mean he meant to ask her but he never did 
but he did find physical evidence that he might be an abductee when he used a black light 
to examine his body and found that his body certain patches of it fluoresced under a black 
under an ultraviolet light and this is a condition that's well known among abductees and is evidence of contact so yeah dr lear thinks he may have been taken on board a 
ufo and they were interested in the way he was researching them and this seems to be the pattern 
i'm beginning to wonder if all ufo researchers are having contact it's just that some don't remember 
consider what happened to barbara lamb who like edith fiore became interested in ufos as a result 
of research into past lives this sort of thing barbara lam was using hypnotic regression to bring 
people back to past lives when some people started recalling past lives as ETs or actual present life 
on board ufo encounters and it wasn't long before she herself had face to face contact with the teas 
on multiple occasions she revealed this all just recently in 2021 at the ufo megacon in las vegas 
and she talked about how she had a face-to-face encounter with a reptilian 
in her home in her living room she walked right up to it shook its hand was a very friendly 
benevolent encounter on another occasion after returning home from a ufo meeting in ventura 
she was driving on the pacific coast highway along the coast there which is a very active hot spot 
and she passed by what looked like a strange vehicle with strange people in uniforms around 
it and suddenly this beam of light hit her car and her windshield actually cracked she was frightened 
and drove home and after thinking about this anomalous experience decided that she would go 
under hypnosis which she did with dolores cannon and under hypnosis she recalled being taken on 
board she recalled a beam of light hit her car her car with her and it was pulled onto a craft 
and these little cute grays surrounded the her car she said they looked very childlike 
friendly just peering in and tilting their heads they were very thin almost looked bony they 
unlocked the doors and floated her into another room and she was placed into a dentist-like chair 
they put a helmet over her head they were very excited to find out that she was a ufo researcher 
and told her that they were taking her memories borrowing them is what they said not stealing them 
they made that very clear they told her that they were contacting many people and trying to learn 
about humanity and she learned a bunch of information and says it was an entirely benevolent 
encounter she wasn't scared in the least and she since had further encounters they always 
seem to come with a purpose or a message and this is happening to a lot of ufo researchers consider 
what happened to virginia oronson virginia oronson became interested in ufo healing cases 
she actually contacted me after reading my book ufo healings and wrote her own book celestial 
healings about people who have been healed as a result of ufo contact and as she looked into the 
ufo phenomena she began having encounters she had a visitation right into her bedroom once she woke 
up there was this weird glittery substance all over her hands and looking back into her childhood 
she found into her you know past she found several instance incidents which pointed towards contact 
so now she's beginning to wonder if she's in contact with the ET's as she writes when I 
began to explore the celestial healing phenomenon I did not suspect that I too might have a personal 
history of ET experiences no I would not be surprised to discover that I do there are indeed 
a number of indicators that in retrospect could point to a history of some kind of relationship 
with non-human beings and in fact she believed she may have actually been healed as many people have 
also reported so I was really surprised to see how many researchers are reporting this another 
is leo sprinkle very well known researcher who's written a number of books about ufos leo sprinkle 
had a sighting in the fall of 1949 while attending the university of colorado at boulder he saw this 
metallic disc with his friend they refused to talk about it to anyone but each other for being 
fear of called kooks and it was not long later in 1956 seven years later when he and his wife 
had a sighting uh again of this anomalous object um as he says we watched it for several minutes 
it would hover then move hover then move it had no sound and no features that I could observe 
but I knew something unusual was going on because I could hear the honking of the horns below us in 
colorado so this was a brilliant red light that he saw while driving with his wife 
near boulder and the object then moved off and disappeared and this was what really inspired him 
to research ufos it changed his life he ended up getting a doctorate in psychology 
uh he also worked in the army for a number of years before this but he became the first ufo researcher to use hypnosis to uncover hidden memories 
missing time in abductees and he was one of the first real academics to study 
the subject of ufos scientifically so a very profound and influential researcher 
he actually was a founder of the popular rocky mountain ufo conference which was held yearly 
for decades and was just a very very influential figure in this field and he always assumed that 
his interest in ufos was limited to these two sightings and the work he did with abductees 
but after getting some uh flashbacks of weird childhood encounters himself he decided he 
would go under hypnosis and under hypnosis he discovered that he was in fact a contactee 
and had been since he was a little boy under hypnosis he recalled that as a child in his 
home in rocky ford colorado he was taken on board a spacecraft just like raymond fowler 
leo sprinkle recalls looking out of a porthole and seeing not only stars but again an image of the planet saturn life-like and close up a tall man stood right beside him and 
told leo sprinkle that leo should learn to read and write well and that as an adult he would help 
other people to become aware of their purpose of their life so leah sprinkle believes yeah he was 
taken on board and guided by friendly ET's and ET's I mean this is very interesting did the ETs 
know that he would become a very prominent and influential researcher just like raymond fowler 
i think so I really do because it keeps happening and many many researchers are reporting this 
they will start researching ufos and then ufos research them or vice versa they have 
a ufo sighting and that causes them to become a very prominent ufo researcher 
well look at what happened to timothy good one of my favorite researchers he's from england 
he's written a number of really excellent books like above top secret and many others in 1961 
timothy good became interested in the subject of ufos and began to read and research the subject he 
learned that telepathy often plays a powerful role he's particularly interested in accounts involving 
human looking ETs many of the accounts he have he has written about involved human-looking ET's 
and one evening in 1967 timothy good was staying at the park sheraton hotel in manhattan new york 
and anna whim decided to conduct an experiment and telepathically trying to contact ET's for about an 
hour he sat in the lobby of the hotel sending out the mental message and I quote if there are any 
space people around let your presence be known and to his shock his request was answered as timothy 
good writes finally as I was about to give up a very healthy looking man about five foot ten 
inches came over sat down beside me and took out a copy of the new york times from his attache case 
good was amazed and stunned and he mentally sent out a message saying if you're a space 
man touch your finger to your nose the response was immediate and positive as timothy good writes 
without once looking directly at me he did exactly as I had requested in my silent message 
timothy good was so amazed that he was unable to react as the man quickly stood up and walked away 
but to this day he's convinced that he made contact with the human looking ET right there in 
the heart of new york city which may sound amazing but there are other cases where people have seen 
et's in public places he's not the only one and in fact he had another encounter like this at a ufo 
meeting this does happen another researcher who had an encounter is malcolm robinson 
he is the author of ufo case files of scotland volumes 1 and 2 and several other books and what 
many people don't know is that his research was inspired by a sighting in 1970 when he was around 
13 maybe 14 years old he was at his uh his primary school at bankery primary school playing football 
when he looked up and was shocked to see quote a white egg-shaped object floating about 200 yards 
or so up in the sky he pointed out to his friends and they all looked at it wondering 
what it could be was it a obviously wasn't a plane or a helicopter his friends thought it might be a balloon but malcolm robinson was sure that it wasn't 
because it was very large about 30 feet across and stationary in the sky 
and as malcolm robinson says and I quote it looked so strange and majestic in this lovely summer sky 
i remember thinking what can it be what purpose did it serve I took my gaze away from the object for only a matter of seconds but somewhat inevitably in that small space 
of time between looking away and looking back the object had gone it had completely vanished 
and it ended up having a profound effect on his life I mean he became a ufo researcher 
what's really interesting is he completely forgot about this sighting he didn't know it he researched ufos for years until suddenly remembering this as malcolm robinson writes 
this then was my first introduction into what would later in life mean so very much to me 
funnily enough in my lifetime of ufo investigating and regularly talking to numerous journalists and 
television people all who wanted to know if I had my own ufo experiences I have never 
recalled this incident until now is only now that this recollection has come back to me 
strange indeed so here we have that weird pattern again I mean he didn't even remember 
and yet he became a very prominent and influential researcher and a lot of researchers 
are reporting sightings as from early childhood or right after they start researching ufos 
look at walt andres who is the co-founder of mufon the mutual ufo network the world's 
largest civilian ufo research organization and still operating today way back on august 15 
1948 walt andrus who worked for the u.s navy electronics technician he was a pilot and amateur 
radio operator and it was his job to launch weather balloons actually and he was in downtown 
phoenix arizona with his wife and child when his five-year-old son shouted out daddy look silver 
balloons and he looked and he saw four round dull silver objects floating in the northwest sky 
moving west and they were in a geometric formation they were totally silent he's absolutely sure 
they weren't balloons because he's very familiar with balloons as a weather observer he launched 
balloons on a daily basis a lot of people were there they all stopped what they were doing and 
stared in amazement this is a very brazen sighting very much in your face kind of again a display and 
the objects moved across flying in formation and then suddenly disappeared and then they reappeared 
again and he could definitely see that these were thin disk-like objects as walt anders says 
you remember it vividly it makes an impression in your mind that you never wipe out following this 
he became fascinated by ufos he joined afro the aerial phenomena research organization which was 
the only research organization out there really at that time and later became as I said the 
co-founder of mufon I think the ETs may have known this because this is exactly what happened to jim 
and coral lorenzen who are actually the founders of apro the aerial phenomena research organization 
before founding apro on june 10th 1947 coral lorenzen stepped outside on her porch 
when she saw a glow forming to the south and increased in brightness until it became a 
bright ball of light which zipped upwards at high speeds until disappearing off into the distance 
she was shocked and it absolutely convinced her that something that she had seen something really 
unusual as she says and I quote fantastic as it might seem there was only one explanation for 
the thing I had seen there might be intelligent life on other worlds and their ships were the 
strange things people had reported in the heavens from time to time through the years 
and it was five years later in january of 1952 that coral and jim lorenzen founded 
the aerial phenomenon research organization the first civilian ufo research group of any 
size and influence I wonder if the tts knew this she later did have another sighting on november 9 
1957 in new mexico during a huge wave of sightings that was sweeping across new mexico and texas in 
particular but all across the country so this is a pattern that is quite prominent many many ufo 
researchers i'm wondering if it's all of them uh have had encounters maybe some just don't remember 
but were influenced this subconsciously that's pure speculation on my part but this is so common 
for example grant cameron who is a very prominent researcher he's written a book about ufos and 
presidents ufos and musicians he wrote an excellent book called ufo bedtime stories 
uh runs a very popular podcast he's a very popular and influential researcher a lot of people don't 
know is he only became a researcher after having his own sighting this was in 1975 in the town of 
carmen manitoba where he saw a bright red glowing object which came to be popularly known as charlie 
red star this was a huge wave of sightings which took place during the summers of 1975 and 1976. 
hundreds of people saw this object including police officers and television crews many 
many people saw this some saw different objects some people saw entities it was a huge wave of 
sightings in which the ET's seem to be putting on a publicity campaign showing themselves off 
intentionally and perhaps we know why they were trying to interest people announce their presence 
it certainly worked for grant cameron and it turned him into a very prominent ufo researcher I really wonder if this is one of the reasons they're showing themselves to people 
i think so because look at what happened to peter davenport peter davenport 
was just six years old on july 17 1954 when he went to the skyline drive-in theater in st 
louis missouri and uh was watching the movie with about 600 other people when suddenly this bright 
glowing red ufo showed up very low it shined this eerie red light all over the parking lot there 
everybody saw he was extremely impressed this caused in him a lifelong interest in ufos and 
absolutely convinced him that ufos were real he held this interest in ufos throughout his life he wasn't an investigator but he did become very 
good friends with bob gribble a very prominent researcher who was actually the founder of 
new fork the national ufo reporting center and bob gribble founded this organization in uh 1974 
and 20 years later he had just gotten overwhelmed with work and couldn't do it anymore and told 
peter davenport that he was giving it up because he couldn't find anyone else to take it over 
and peter davenport agreed to become the director of the national ufo reporting center 
and this is how peter davenport became a very influential figure in the ufo field 
and it all started with his childhood sighting as peter davenport says and I quote in his own words 
what originally got me involved in ufos was the very dramatic sighting I had as a young boy it 
was at that point that I was committed to becoming the director of the national ufo reporting center 
it looks to me and at first it became apparent to me from that sighting that we are dealing with something that is not manufactured on this planet the reason i'm 
the director of the national ufo reporting center is because of that sighting in 1954
so there's that pattern again and this is what makes me think the ETs are doing this on purpose 
and perhaps they know that these people will become very influential in the field uh they 
do have the ability to predict future events they have given people many prophecies which 
have come true i've talked to people who've had this experience so perhaps they are doing this 
intentionally and look at what happened to bud hopkins but hopkins is of course was at its time 
the single most influential leading ufo researcher in ufo abductions he wrote his book missing time 
intruders and many other very influential books and what many people don't know is 
he had a sighting in 1964 which got him involved in ufo research he was driving with four friends 
in the near truro massachusetts when they came upon a ufo hovering 
overhead they all saw it bud hopkins was driving someone else pointed out it was a silvery disk 
that sometimes got hidden in the cloud banks the clouds would move by and they all saw it 
and it was just hovering in place as if it meant to be seen and it was not that high up according 
to bud it was pretty large two car lengths long he estimates not moving and dull aluminum in color 
and as they drove closer to it they actually drove right under it and it was definitely a solid craft 
and as they're watching it it started to slowly move away and they watched this thing 
it actually stopped the car and jumped out as they watched this thing move off to the north east and 
he said it was actually pretty slow moved like the speed of a small airplane and he said we were stunned confused and excited and he says one of us I forget who said do you suppose 
that was one of those flying saucers you used to read about and this is what really inspired him to 
become a ufo researcher at the time he was a very successful artist he did not need to research ufos
following this he began he noticed that a lot of his art was actually featuring these 
round objects very much like the one he had seen so that intrigued him as well at any rate 
it doesn't appear to be a coincidence that he saw this ufo and shortly later began 
investigating ufos so this is ufo investigators disease and I can tell you I have caught a bad 
case of it and I would like to talk about my own encounters because a number of you have asked me 
to do this and so yeah let's talk about my own encounters I did recently speak at the ufo con 
ufo megacon in laughlin nevada I talked about it so I think it's okay now to 
spill the beans and tell you that yes I have had contact with ufos and perhaps even more than that 
when I i first became interested in ufos because of a news report in 1986 
and I discovered that my brother had seen a ufo my brother mark his wife my sister-in-law had had face-to-face encounters with short blue dwarf-like beings 
when she was a kid I had several friends who had close-up sightings one had missing time 
people at work that I worked with had had close-up sightings one one they had encounters with great 
idt's another had missing time uh so yeah this was in my family my sister had a baby later and 
had a close-up encounter two nephews had close encounters so this is definitely in my family 
but I personally hadn't had any encounters I scoured my paths looking for anything that might 
be any clue that I have had some kind of contact with ufos and I found nothing really nothing more 
recently I have discovered what might have been an incident involving missing time when I was about 
eight years old so now i'm wondering but that wasn't apparent to me at the time 
so I just became very much obsessed by ufos and started researching them and it wasn't long before I had my own encounter the first occurred at a ufo meeting down in santa monica with contact 
andy rice who after talking about his experiences at a little ufo meeting there took a group of 
about 20 of us out into the park across the street in downtown santa monica and called down a ufo I 
was amazed he actually did it there were no stars in the sky the light pollution was too thick 
but we weren't out there very long when he pointed to the sky and said here they come in about 26 
seconds later this huge star-like object swooped down it looked like a shooting star but it was 
much brighter and had a weird kind of angle to it but it was a bit ambiguous still it was impressive 
that he could point to the section of the sky and it appeared that was my first real sighting 
and I was really intrigued it was not long after this that I became embroiled in a huge 
investigation into a ufo wave over topanga canyon this was in the summer of 1992. i've since re 
wrote written a book about this called ufos over topanga canyon and during this investigation I 
did have a couple of sightings of anomalous lights nothing I would really you know write home about 
but it was in july of 1992 that my family and I went up to northern california to the mount 
shasta crater lake area and I had a really cool sighting with my brother mark and my sister-in-law 
kisara we stayed up late one night the rest of the family was asleep we were looking at the 
stars when my brother shot it out I saw something and he grabbed the flashlight and flashed upwards 
and we all looked up and saw this bright bright light flash back at us it wasn't a satellite I can 
tell you that it was bright and the light kind of moved out from the sides and it disappeared 
mark flashed the flashlight twice and this object flashed twice back at us 
it was obvious communication this was a ce5 event and it was really crazy and really coincidental 
because it was a month later that I was actually became a member of seasetti the center for the 
study of extraterrestrial intelligence founded by dr stephen greer he came to la to form a chapter 
here in southern california I wasn't going to go to his meeting there his presentation 
because I couldn't afford it it was asking for a couple hundred bucks and i'm like no 
but the newspaper the local paper the messenger called me up and offered to pay my way 
and uh if I would write an article they said we don't know why we're doing this 
but we feel compelled to do it I was shocked but I totally agreed of course and went to the lecture 
and was shocked when stephen greer mentioned two of my own cases which I had researched 
in which people used lights and lasers as a publicity stunt for you know radio stations or nbc 
they were designed to attract attention but to their shock they called down ufos twice the main 
guy says this happens frequently whenever he does his light shows ufos will appear 
so stephen greer was talking about this as a method to call down ufos and that night we went 
up to the santa susana pass which is not far from where we were holding a lecture in canoga park 
and uh this is a pretty rural area though it does overlook the san fernando valley and no sooner 
had we got there there was a group of about 50 of us and someone shouted out look and we all looked 
upwards and there was this huge blob of light way up there at the zenith but it was big it's about 
as big as a half moon maybe and moving across the sky for just a short moment before winking out I 
was impressed I knew it wasn't a satellite wasn't the plane or a balloon or a helicopter or anything 
like that it was a ufo and this much smaller group of us went out the next night about 20 of us and 
had another encounter where weird strobes of light came over our group I was hooked we formed 
a group of a core group of about 10 members and frequently well not frequently but periodically 
had sightings with anomalous lights mostly uh over a period of about five years we did this 
every other month or so late at night and would have sightings calling down ufos it was amazing 
uh probably one of our best was again at santa susana pass where these bright lights appeared and we communicated at them with our flashlights they'd blink we'd blink we'd blink they'd blink 
one point we flashed our flashlights and they flare these lights we were flashing 
with suddenly flared up bright bright red very powerfully like a giant prism it was beautiful 
i've never seen anything quite that bright and not a red light certainly I don't know 
how anyone could make a red light that bright in the area where we were looking at it so yeah 
i joined cse and I started having sightings regularly with sea seti and it was during 
this time I started to have my own sightings of 1992 was a really the breakaway year for me 
and my first real sighting occurred in late july of 1992 when I was driving home through woodland 
hills I just left my brother's house mark and kisara in woodland hills and i'm still on their 
street actually galandrina it's a tiny little street and I was coming around a hairpin corner 
when suddenly I was going like two three miles per hour we're on the terrapin corner when a bird came 
swooping down at my car I thought it was a bird it was way high up 300 feet up maybe to my right 
and looking up I saw instantly this wasn't a bird because it was glowing I thought gosh could this 
be a firecracker you know it's late july but I knew instantly it wasn't a firecracker because 
this thing targeted me it came right for my car and stopped in front of my windshield 
it's as close as I am now to this computer screen it was a foot away maybe two feet 
and it was a small golf ball sized orb bright yellow white 
maybe a little bit bigger than a golf ball totally silent and it went back and forth back and forth 
two maybe three times stopped it's right over the hood of my car and then it moved forward dipped 
down almost touched the street and went straight up through the canopy of trees and was gone and weirdly I completely forgot about it it left my mind I did not remember 
i now think I had missing time I don't remember driving home or anything really after this was only several months later that I even remembered the sighting and it took me 
a while to realize that I may have in fact had a missing time so yeah that was my first really 
close encounter but more started to follow very quickly in fact and it was not long after that
that I had another sighting uh I had a really good sighting with c seti on july 16th 
1994 where I was heading a c city meditation and there were sea city groups all across the u.s 
trying to call down ufos and during the meditation I got a really strong impulse to look up 
and I resisted it first but this boom finally I just looked up and this little pin prick of light appeared and it got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until it was like covering 
most of the sky and it winked out I was the only one who saw but I was really impressed because I 
got a very powerful telepathic impression to look up we're here we're here look up 
and this sort of thing has happened again it was around this same time that I was interviewing a 
lady i'll call wendy who was an abductee and her case was extremely extensive she reported having 
having hybrid babies once she reported waking up and finding grays around her bed she jumped up and 
kicked one in the neck and snapped its neck and so I was transcribing her interview one evening 
in my condo in canoga park and I just gotten to that part where she had snapped a gray's neck 
and I thought to myself is this real this is a lot i'm now sure she was telling the truth she's very 
sincere she's since become a very good friend but this was a lot for me to take in and i'm leaning 
back in my chair wondering like is this for real how do I wrap my head around this when I got a 
very powerful impulse to go under the roof of my condo so powerful in fact I couldn't resist it and 
before I even knew what I was doing I had grabbed my glasses which I used for driving I was slightly 
nearsighted and I ran up onto the roof of my condo you're not allowed up there I don't go up there 
but there I was in the roof of my condo with my glasses on wondering what the heck I was doing 
i wasn't up there more than 20 seconds when this ufo appeared right across the street maybe 200 
feet away tree top level right above the palm trees there was a bright fiery orange disc 
maybe five to ten feet in diameter very apparent and it blasted me with a message 
a telepathic message it wasn't in english it wasn't in words but the message was clear and 
the message was hi where wendy's ET's you don't believe huh she's telling the truth watch this and 
this thing darted around back and forth back and forth back and forth 10 times maybe 20 at sharp 
acute angles very high speed and disappeared I was stunned I stumbled back downstairs I should have 
called wendy right away I don't even know if I had missing time I honestly don't I don't think so 
but I know that missing time can be seamless at any rate I called her up the next day and I says wendy you're not going to believe it your ET's came to say hi and to let me know 
that you were telling the truth and she's like I told you um I mean we had a good laugh about it 
uh and uh continued to interview her and as I said i've become very good friends with her 
still i'm in touch with her in fact I did a youtube video with her recently called conversation with a walk-in so you can look that up if you'd like at any rate
wendy told me she's in telepathic contact with the ETs and I said well can i'd like to see a ufo close up even closer than that which you know I already had a close-up 
setting but I wanted to see them see them because I wasn't ready for that that really surprised me 
and she agreed and said she'd get back to me she called me up a few weeks later and said okay 
the ut's have agreed to show themselves to you and I was super excited so off we went to the predetermined location at a predetermined time 
this is off the 210 freeway in pasadena in southern california I went with wendy my 
sister-in-law kitsara and my nephew james uh kisara's son and uh we pulled off the freeway 
wendy pointed to this smallish mountain she said we have to climb up there and the youtubes will 
show themselves to you so that's what we did and it was a strenuous 20-minute hike and uh kisara 
and my nephew james fell behind us a couple of hundred yards and wendy and I arrived at the top 
and no sooner had we got to the top of this uh little mountain there or at least top of 
part of the mountain there were other peaks above us and wendy screams and spins me around 
and points she didn't need to point because right in front of us about 30 40 feet away maybe 50. 
gosh I mean it was close it was like the house next door close and it was very very low 
no higher than a tree definitely treetop level and it was a huge golden sphere 
covered with lights it was exquisitely beautiful as big as a house totally silent 
hovering there perfectly still for just a few moments I didn't receive any messages 
other than maybe hi it's us but no not really it was just there in your face we were screaming 
jumping up and down we were so happy I mean it was unmistakably beautiful was absolutely gorgeous 
and uh it was there for just maybe 30 seconds breathtakingly beautiful when finally started to 
move off slowly we ran after it for just a few seconds because then it started really 
moving fast and zipped away like a bullet it moved about five miles away in one second 
as it sort of twirled around this in a parabola and went behind the mountain 
that we were climbing and disappeared I mean it went so fast you could barely follow it with your 
eyes and left sort of this golden tracer it was really cool and probably one of my best 
sightings ever and as wendy says and i'll just quote wendy directly 
we looked up and there was that thing that gold ship that was shooting through and we ran after it chasing it was so close I thought we could jump high enough to touch it 
it sparkled with gold sparkles shooting off of it all over the place it was awesome it was pretty 
spectacular I mean it was gold and it wasn't long after that I had another amazing sighting 
this was an actual solid craft and this was again due to my ufo research with another person who was 
having very close-up sightings and perhaps even missing time he has since written a book about how 
to contact ufos he discovered that if you look into the corona of the sun while keeping your 
face in shadow and looking into the corona itself not into the disc 
you can see stuff that is illuminated in the powerful light levels of the cr sun's corona 
this was exactly around the same time as this tim salida or the tim edwards 
sighting rather in salida colorado in which he used the same method at any rate 
this gentleman john wilke had discovered this and he's actually written a book about it 
and he instructed me on how to do it and so one morning in july of 1995 I during my 
lunch break at work I stepped out of the building and was looking up and saw this 
huge object approaching from the south from my left moving northward to my right 
directly overhead it was huge it was triangular well kind of boomerang shaped but more triangular 
it was huge I mean this thing could have been a quarter mile in length because it 
was about a thousand feet maybe two thousand three thousand feet high but low I couldn't really tell 
but I could see detail on it was gray metal it had a ring on front and two rings on the rear and 
triangular shape gray metal it sort of was almost invisible as it approached but became more and 
more solid as I looked at it overhead it's almost the color of the sky is sort of a steel gray blue 
but was very much a solid craft as I looked at it overhead uh many hundreds of feet in length 
uh could have helped thousands and thousands of people I mean it was huge and this thing just moves off totally silent to the north and as it got just sort of at 45 degrees 
it disappeared again it was cloaked it was amazing I consider it the best sighting i've had and since 
then there have been others i've had a number of interesting sightings with lights anomalous 
lights it seems like whenever I write a book and one of my new books will come out i'll have a sighting or if I quit writing for a little while one will appear and be like 
write a book um I don't know if i'm reading into that or not but sometimes it feels like yeah 
there's a little bit of a message there of them saying hi to me one time in the late 1990s I was 
driving from san diego to l.a late at night I just visited a friend in san diego and looking ahead of 
me on the freeway which was quite crowded I saw a large globe of light hovering over the freeway 
it was a quite a cloudy night there was a low cloud cover about a hundred feet maybe 200 feet 
and here's this huge globe of light right over the freeway it did not look normal and as I got 
right under it I could see it wasn't attached to anything no other cars were stopping it's really 
strange i'm looking up at this thing thinking what the heck is this when I got a very strong 
mental message this thing spoke to me and it said your niece is born this was not in english 
it was just telepathic knowing this ufo came to tell me a message that my niece had just been 
born it's very strange these are the kinds of experiences i've had 
and it has gone beyond this I will admit that I think I might be an actual 
because there was one occasion when I was still living in canoga park in that condo I no longer lived there so this would have been the late 1990s 
when I woke up one evening because I felt a cat walking across my bed I don't have a cat so that 
shocked me and I was lying on my side and I opened my eyes and I saw something that was very thin 
and it scared me my heart went up I mean frightened me as this thing darted away 
uh out the bedroom door and into my living room should have jumped up to follow and investigate but I didn't I didn't react the way I thought I would uh instead I 
just turned over and went back to sleep uh which is something that you know happens 
with contactees i've certainly interviewed enough people to know this so yeah on some level I think 
i may be having actual contact more recently I had an experience which I recalled as a dream 
but it was a very vivid and unusual dream because I found myself in this room with steel gray walls slightly shiny and I was amazed because i'm like oh this looks like a ufo 
and the walls curved into the floor there were no corners and I looked up and the walls curved 
into the ceiling and suddenly this eight foot tall figure approached me was wearing a white jumpsuit 
it had very pale skin I couldn't see its face but it radiated love and wisdom and gave me a little 
tour of the i'll call it a craft I felt like a visitor it was very friendly took me into another 
room pointed to the wall which turned transparent and I was shocked as this wall turned transparent 
because this is again something i've certainly heard people talk about and certainly read about 
it the wall turns transparent and I was even more shocked because we were underwater so this was a uso I don't know but this is what i've been seeing I i did have another dreamlike 
experience with this eight foot tall being and even more recently had another experience where 
i was being taught about free energy motors which really intrigued me because I did a video on this 
about abductees being taught about how to build free energy motors they were showing me one 
with a number of other people and then I got to look out a window at an amazing star field so yeah 
i think I might be a contactee it's taking me a little while to adjust to this and believe it 
i don't know i'm still a little on the fence about it but other weird stuff is happening 
because wendy did tell me that she was guided to contact me by the ET's or rather she asked the 
et's and they said yes it's okay to tell her story to me and this happened recently with another 
contactee who i'm currently interviewing and even more recently this year a gentleman from england 
called me and he said are you preston did it the ufo researcher and I said yes how may I help you 
and he says well i'm a contactee i'm in contact with grey aliens and I just had a contact with 
them they came to me this morning and what I don't know if it was this morning but uh very recently 
and uh he said that the grey ETs told him to contact a gentleman by the name of preston dennett 
who he did not know and he looked me up and found out I was a ufo researcher 
so i'm like are you serious grace told you to call me that gave you my name he's like yeah 
yeah they told me to call you they wanted me to talk to you so of course we did talk 
and it turned out he had been given precognitive information and warnings about nuclear proliferation and upcoming possible environmental disasters and he wondered if any 
other people had reported this and I said oh yeah that is their number one message because 
it is this is the message they give to many many people so that knocked my socks flat off 
i mean ET's know about me are they reading my books this is freaking me out the greys know about 
me and are actually referring people to me which is actually really cool I mean that's amazing to 
me and now i'm wondering if perhaps I have had encounters in my childhood that i'm not aware of 
because there was a weird incident once where I may have had missing time as an eight-year-old 
i just remember somehow I skipped lunch my family served lunch and I wasn't there I was pretty upset 
uh it's kind of vague but there are other little pointers I don't know but definitely now I appear to be having contact on some level certainly and I think i've caught 
myself a good old case of ufo investigators disease and that's why I wanted to do this 
episode because I think it's important that people know that many ufo researchers are having ufo 
sightings or were inspired to become a researcher because of a sighting or it's important that 
people know that if you start researching ufos you may very well yourself be researched by ufos 
so that's why I want to do this video I covered several of these kinds of cases in my book not 
from here volume 2 and I know for a fact there are other ufo researchers who have not come forward who have reported encounters because i've talked to them myself so yeah I 
think it's probably more common than most people realize I want to thank you very much for watching 
i really appreciate your support I hope you've enjoyed it and until next time keep having fun.
