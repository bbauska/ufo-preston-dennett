FROM BEYOND EARTH: TEN HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS
Jul 19, 2024

Summary:
Jul 19, 2024
When it comes to extraterrestrials, the humanoid form seems to be the universal template. The vast majority of reports involve some kind of bipedal humanoid. And there are sooo many! These accounts come from across the planet, and have been occurring for a very long time. The cases have astounding similarities that point towards the veracity of these accounts, and they are also supported by a wide variety of evidence. This video presents ten cases of face-to-face encounters with humanoids. There are too many cases to ignore, deny or explain away. The evidence speaks for itself. There is life beyond Earth.

ET CONTACTS DEAF-MUTE MAN. One evening in 1950, 13-year-old William Ortiz (who was deaf) saw a gray-type ET outside his home in Floridablanca, Colombia. Moments later, he saw a landed craft and several other figures. The ET closest to him then communicated telepathically and used sign-language. Afterwards, William’s hearing was temporarily restored. It was to be the first of three amazing encounters.

THE LITTLE MAN OF NORBOTTEN. From 1970-1972, people over a wide area near Norbotten, Sweden encountered a strange little man that did not appear to be human. The little figure was often seen along highways late at night, and was usually accompanied by blinding lights and mysterious sounds. Some witnesses reported strange medical effects after their encounters.

ALIENS AT A RADIO STATION. In the Spring of 1975, a nightwatchman at the Maribor Radio station in Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) received a series of strange phone-calls at the station. Two months later, he was at work when TV malfunctioned. Then, in walked four tall humanoid figures. One approached the witness (now unable to move) and pressed his thumb against his neck. The high strangeness had just begun.

ALIEN OR ESCAPED CIRCUS DWARF? At 4pm on May 14, 1976, two men were shocked to see a short humanoid in the wilderness at Monte Parodi, Italy. It wore a strange jumpsuit and floated above the ground. Four months later, on September 17, 1976, 15 witnesses saw another short humanoid in the same area. This time, there were landing traces, radiation readings, and one of the witnesses photographed the ET.

A PURPLE-HAIRED ALIEN. On the morning of March 13, 1978, Claudio Franco (age 10) was at school in Vilar Formosa, Portugal. During class, he went alone to the restroom and as he exited, he was pushed down. Then he saw a shocking sight: a humanoid figure with purple hair, a wrinkled and scarred face, wearing a skintight white jumpsuit stared down at him. After 10 minutes, the figure disappeared. Claudio found burn-marks on his back.

WE LOVE YOU. On the evening of October 14, 1978, Peggy Otis and her young granddaughter Jenny were driving to their home in Bear Valley, Colorado when a UFO appeared over their car. Peggy recalls exiting the car, screaming, and seeing what she thought were angels. Later, she sought hypnosis, and recalled having a telepathic conversation with gray aliens who had important messages to share with her.

MY WORLD WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE THE SAME. One evening in August of 1979, Mrs. H.M. Dickinson was in her home overlooking Patten Bay in Surry, Maine when she and a friend saw a small bulb-shaped, transparent craft with a bald-headed creature inside floating a few feet away. The creature turned its head and stared at her as it floated off. A few days later, the being returned!

I NEVER BELIEVED IN ALIENS. Around dusk one evening in February 1981, an anonymous farmer from Westfield, North Carolina went to look for his dog who had run off. He found his dog attacking a small, thin, hairless humanoid with large dark eyes. The humanoid's legs were mangled by his dog. The farmer ran off in fear. When he returned the next day, the humanoid was gone, and his dog was dead.

WE COME FROM VERY FAR AWAY. On the night of February 6, 1991, Sylvia and two friends observed a UFO near Sylvia’s home in Chaville, France. Returning home, Sylvia was struck by a beam of light from the object. That night, strange humanoids visited her in her bedroom. The next morning, she received a telepathic message from the ETs and had a face-to-face encounter with an apparent gray alien.

THE ALIENS FOLLOWED THEM HOME. On the afternoon of December 19, 2015, two brothers (Miguel and Patricio) were hiking in the forests near their home in Auracania, Chile when two tall humanoids wearing white jumpsuits confronted them. The boys ran home and the humanoids chased them. Arriving home, they locked the doors. Their mother also saw the two humanoids, which remained outside for the next two hours. 

These ten cases contain many important insights into the nature of UFO contact. They show how similar ETs can be. They show how contact can be very frightening. They show how truly advanced extraterrestrials are. Most importantly, these cases provide compelling evidence for the reality of visitors from beyond Earth.

Jul 19, 2024
hello everyone my name is Preston dennet and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the Paranormal let's talk humanoid
today's episode is called from beyond Earth 10 humanoid encounters today I've got cases from all
over the world reaching back in time all the way actually to 1950 up to 2015 so some pretty recent
cases and cases from Europe of course Sweden port Portugal Italy France
Yugoslavia actually as well as Chile and Colombia in South America and three
cases from the United States these are cases that involve a wide variety of
humanoids who it's my assessment are probably from beyond Earth but you can certainly make up your own mind about
that these are cases that involve Landings uh face-to-face encounters with
humanoids some really interesting interaction as well and of course all kinds of
evidence and by that I mean Landing traces electromagnetic
disturbances physiological effects animal reactions and get this there's
one case which involves a photograph of an alleged ET so this should be pretty
interesting I've said it before but it Bears repeating each case adds to our knowledge of what's going on here each
case provides its own unique insight into the UFO phenomenon in the first
case I'd like to talk about today I found this one to be really poignant and quite interesting and unique I call this
one ET contacts a deaf mute man this is a really compelling case which took
place actually it's three encounters the first occurring in 1950 the second in
1969 and the third in 1975 these all occurred in Flora Florida
Blanca in Colombia and I think you'll find it quite interesting case comes from
researcher virilio Sanchez oio and it was also confirmed by Jay
Allen heck who personally interviewed the witness now the witness is an artist
by the name of William Ortiz and he was born in bukar manga in
Colombia in 1937 though lived in Florida Blanca
which is really just south of bukar manga it was at age five that he lost
his hearing how this happened is not described but in 1950 at age 13 he had
his first of three experiences with extraterrestrials it was just a little
past 700 p.m. and William was riding his horse on the gravel road on his parents prop
property when he saw what he first thought was a child standing behind the bushes alongside this road but as he
continued to ride an opening appeared in the bushes and he saw this large
disc-shaped object and several other small childlike figures moving around it
this object was hovering over a large rock this is significant but he now saw
that these figures were not children at all and looking at the closest figure he saw that it was wearing a tight-fitting
unifor form with a turtleneck collar that covered everything except for the head and hands the head was large in
proportion to the body and hairless the eyes were large oval-shaped and dark you
can see the drawing by the witness here so these look like typical Grays he saw no ears just a hole on the side of the
head a very small nose and thin lips he said they appeared to have four fingers
on their hands though he's not sure of this he said their skin was kind of grayish Brown
now this closest entity was only 6 or 7 ft away the others in the craft were
about 100 ft away and some of the other figures the ones by the craft William
noticed had smaller eyes than the one that was right next to him so he started
focusing on this little gray standing in front of him and he could see that it
was male that was his impression he said it was staring directly at him and
actually began to send him telepathic messages while at the same time used hand signals
now again William is unable to hear he's deaf and he said that there were eight
words that this gray transmitted to him and they came so fast that he's not sure
if he got the correct sequence but the words as he recalls are
in world
stop secret
Sky see
learn love
so that's interesting Williams not quite sure what this message meant but after
it was delivered the entity turned moved behind a rock outcropping disappearing
from view for Just a moment and then began to float and sort of walk very quickly towards the craft by this point
the other entities had already moved inside the craft this last one entered and instantly the craft moved straight
up and moved off to the Southwest and disappeared over the horizon now William again was riding his
horse he's not sure if his horse reacted in anyway as he was so astonished by the encounter and all the implications it
carried but what's really interesting about this case is that this craft was hovering over a very famous rock
formation called the Great Rock by locals it measures about 30 ft in
diameter and 12 ft High pictured here at any rate William says the UFO was about
the same size as this rock and this rock is carved with various markings
including lines disc shapes serpents and other figures and symbols which are
believed to have been carved by the indigenous people in this area some thousand years
earlier the really interesting thing about this first encounter is that William he was deaf again his hearing
was temporarily restored unfortunately his deafness returned but he did have a second
encounter in 1969 at age 32 which again resulted in his hearing being
temporarily restored unfortunately this encounter is not described and also his
deafness came back now its final encounter also not described was in
1975 and there was no apparent healing in this case but the most interesting
aspect of this case to me is that William says the ETS communicated with him not only telepathically but using
various hand signals by the way William is educated he's able to read and write
in Spanish I think there's a lot to learn from that case I find it really
interesting not only the witness but where this contact took place right over
this stone with all these ancient carvings on it the communication that
this man had with the ETS who used hand signals that's amazing it's just a
really interesting case all around and now let's move to the next one this this
next case got quite a bit of attention it's actually a series of events I call
this one the little man of norbotten and this took place in the
1970s more specifically 1970 through 1972 primarily in norbut Sweden and
surrounding areas it's quite an amazing series of events which I find super
interesting because these Witnesses who did not know each other and were in
different areas all described very much the same type of
encounter so there's something clearly going on in these cases this case is so interesting
because many people saw this strange little man in the area of norbotten Sweden in fact most of the sightings
occurred in a sharply defined area on roads 98 and 397 which borders the Kix River one of
the first occurred on August 19 1970 when Mr Olaf molander his wife Marta and
their friend Asser Sandberg were driving between Narin and Lula on a dark rainy
night when they saw this 3ot tall man wearing what looked like a helmet and a
gray coat standing alongside the road now as they approached again this is at
night they're driving the little figure put its hands up to its its face as if
to Shield his eyes from the glare of the headlights now moments later the
interior of their vehicle and the road around them became illuminated with a blindingly bright light at the same time
there was a loud banging noise now afterwards this little man was still there but the Witnesses were too afraid
to stop and they drove on what's really interesting is later Oar
Sandberg reported some pretty serious vision problems in one of his eyes this is just one of the series of
events that occurred around this time because it was just a few months later on February 2nd
1971 that Martha man Lindon and her friend were driving near kinki this is
actually in Finland it was around 8:00 p.m. when they noticed a bright light
pacing their vehicle it went from one side and then to the other paced their car down the
highway for some time then darted away and moments later they saw what they
thought was a little child crossing the road right in front of their car in fact Martha thought she was going to hit this
poor kid but they quickly saw that it was not a child but was a little man
wearing these strange green brown clothes and what looked like a helmet uh they were quite frightened and
did not stop and drove off now that same exact evening two
residents in the town of kelari looked out the window of their home and saw
this short little figure standing in the road maybe 3 feet tall described in the
same way he was wearing dark clothes and what looked like a helmet and they didn't think too much of it after a few
moments he disappeared and the only reason they reported it and realized it was unusual
was because they started to hear about the other reports coming in now here's another witness this is
one of the more interesting events of this series of encounters and the main witness in this
case is a Westerberg he's 20 years old and was February 16
1971 was around 6:00 p.m. and a was waiting for the bus when he saw a figure
standing just a short distance away and he thought this is strange because this
figure is very short does not look normal he had a strange hat on his head
and look like kind of a raincoat kind of covering and isaki says at first I
thought it was a comrade in the village so I called out a few names but got no answer then I started walking closer to
see who was standing there I got about 20 M away before he turned on the
light now AKA could see enough to see that this beam of light was coming from a small box strapped to the man's chest
and this beam of light struck AK full on dazzling his vision and causing him to
turn and flee now opening his eyes he looked back
and could see that the entire Road was now bathed in light it was bright enough to cast his own shadow on the road
behind him but aak says it turned a while before I regained my sight it was
dead quiet and I was scared as hell Where I Stood so there's that dead quiet
sound that we often hear in these cases the Oz effect I guess you might call it
at any rate the light faded and when a searched the area this little man was no
longer there but that night a suffered some strange physical symptoms as he
says I woke up in the middle of the the night completely paralyzed my body achd
in a way I had never experienced before or since now thankfully by morning he
was fine but he definitely attaches that to his
experience now another sighting occurred not long after this February 25 Mrs
anmarie lumic saw a 3ot tall little man
and she was driving again and she described the same exact details a helmet dark
clothes and a bright flash of light as she says I didn't feel scared but I'm
absolutely sure I saw the little man so this was starting to get quite a bit of
publicity by this time another report which is not dated but apparently part
of the same cluster events comes from a gentleman by the name of R
strawberg who writes quote one of my friends and her parents met
him when driving their car outside the village it was in a small Road in the woods at late evening he stood in the
road so they had to stop he had black clothes which were a bit shiny like a
raincoat he held a tiny box in front of him and after a short moment he made
some movement with his hand on the box which turned on a light so strong they
had to look away suddenly the light was gone and so was the little man how
interesting is that here we see that pattern that turns up so many times with ETS showing up alongside a remote
Highway at night but it's also interesting because these cases seem to
follow a pretty set pattern with a bright light a loud noise and then the
sighting of this short little humanoid figure don't know what's going on here
but yeah these cases did get quite a bit of publicity and attention and I think it's certainly an important addition to
our understanding of extraterrestrial contact and now we move to the next case
I want to include this one because it provides an important example of the fact that ETS can be seen just about
anywhere I call this case aliens at a radio station this occurred in the
spring of 1975 in marbor Yugoslavia of course
Yugoslavia no longer exists it's now going by a different name but this is a
really interesting case involving a single witness yes but some really
interesting electromagnetic effects of a kind that I haven't quite heard before
and yeah the location of the encounter is also really interesting and the interaction that the witness had with
these really unusual humanoids is just plain fascinating the location of this
incident is now known as Slovenia but at the time it was in marbor
Yugoslavia in fact it took place in downtown marbor at the radio marbor
Studio the eyewitness is Mr barard and he was a night Watchman a lot of night
Watchmen have encounters and this encounter began in a very strange way
with some unusual phone calls and I'll just quote the witness directly
I was on night Duty and it was somewhere between 10 and 10:30 p.m. the office
phone started ringing and I picked it up but no one answered I hung up and at the
same moment the phones rang in the studio they are line phones one is
connected to tnan on the outskirts of marbor and the others to the post office
the phones rang at the same time and I picked up one of the receivers but no one answered Ed from all the phones only
a kind of vibrating sound Was Heard can be compared to the sound of a radio that
is tuned between two stations I tried to call the post office but no one answered I then went back to
the room I used during the service and called the post office from there to ask
why they kept calling and then hang up they replied that they had not called me
at all this evening I got the same answer answer from those I called on the second one I then called our technician
at home who said that it could possibly come from the weather I took a look outside and could see that the weather
was clear and fine so this was a weird series of events had never happened before but the
witness didn't think much of it until about a month or two later when something really weird happened the
witness was at work doing the night shift again he had sat down to watch some TV when weird streaks and snow
began to interfere with the television screen this again had not happened
before finally he just turned off the TV and began doing his rounds and then he walked into the strangest experience of
his life and again I'll just quote the witness directly because he describes it in great detail as he says I went back
to work at the same moment I heard steps out in the hall and Studio where there
were no people at this time I hastened and got up in the chair and at the same moment the office door
opened it was shining outside in the corridor I took a breath for in came
four men and they did not walk like humans one could best describe their way
of walking as leaning elastic springy two of them stood next to me the third
in front and the fourth stood in the doorway as for their appearance I know
noted that they had some sort of hat or helmet on their head their faces were markedly elongated had serious looks and
the eyes seemed motionless all the time Their Eyes Were larger and likewise the
mouth rather large lips and an elongated head the clothing was close fitting and
overall likee the man standing in the doorway almost reached the door frame with his head so he was approximately 2
m High I became very afraid because their looks didn't look quite normal the
two who were standing next to me looked at each other at the same time the one who was standing in front of me raised
his right arm and pressed his thumb into the back of my neck I can still evoke
the feeling of how it felt as he pressed his thumb against my neck at this moment
it was something vibrating around me some kind of unknown energy then without
further do they went back the same way without completely closing the door I
quickly ran out of the room but there was not the slightest trace and no sound was heard from them I went through all
the rooms and checked all the windows but everything was fine now this door had been closed
before so it was left open this gave him confirmation that this did physically happen but these beings were quite
unusual looking in fact they reminded the witness of the famous French comedic
actor by the name of Fernand Del you can see him here they had a very broad
shoulders filling almost the entire doorway he said their clothes were quite dark so quite an unusual encounter and
that was pretty much it but there was an interesting Final End note because the
witness says that after all of this he did see a glowing disc shaped object
hovering near his house a few days before this incident he did receive
another series of strange phone calls but each time he picked up the phone
nobody answered and once when he even picked up the receiver the phone would still ring and there was one final
bizarre detail during this time his phone bills increased for no apparent
reason so there you go what a strange series of events with all these unusual
phone calls his phone Bell going way up for some unexplained reason but
apparently attached to all this and I have to tell you I don't know how I would react if ET suddenly showed up at
my office where I worked walked up to me and pressed their thumb against the back of my neck very strange quite an unusual
series of events but again fits the pattern we do see in a lot of cases how
he describes the ETS uh he saw UFO in connection with all this it's a really interesting in case
and now we move to the next one which also involves more than one event and
this is the one that actually involves a photograph of an apparent ET I call this
one alien or escaped circus dwarf and you'll see why I gave it that title in
just a second this occurred in May and September of 1976 in Monti perodi this is in laspia
Italy and it's a really interesting series of events because there are multiple witnesses there are landing
traces there is an apparent photograph in fact in one of the cases the
witnesses themselves were UFO researchers it's a very wellc confirmed
case now this case involves two separate humanoid sightings which may or may not
be related I think they are they occurred in the same place this case was investigated by Italian researcher stio
asso the first incident occurred on May 14 1976 it was 4:30 in the afternoon as the
witnesses two men known only by their initials BC and na they were hiking
through the abandoned military Barracks at Monti parodi again in laspia Italy
when they saw a strange figure he not only looked strange he was dressed strangely and was moving strangely this
figure was first observed on the doorstep of one of the semi-underground rooms and it was running quickly but
with a very strange awkward gate as the witnesses said quote like if while
walking He Slipped slightly raised on the ground in other words he seems to sort of Glide or float he was quite
short about 3 and 1 half maybe 4 feet tall very thin very frail looking and he
was wearing a skintight black jumpsuit which covered his entire body and head
from hands to feet the only part that wasn't covered was where his eyes would
be and this is where the witnesses saw two slanted slits which seemed to
Glow their figure was observed for about 15 or 20 seconds at which point it
disappeared Into Thin Air this was in an area where there was no vegetation or any place to hide so it disappeared
right in front of them and that was the first case and it was some months later on
September 7 1976 that researcher selio asso went to
this location uh with his daughter and son his daughter's Maria Gracia he also
brought along a photographer by the name of Roberto Molino and a group of about a dozen other UFO researchers they were
all from the Italian UFO Group G Ru the
group of observational research you logical and it was around 8:50 p.m. they
had really just arrived at the scene and this is when they noticed a really unnatural silence this is that weird
odds effect again as selio says the air was perfectly still and oppressive the
silence unnatural no noise it completely lacked those nocturnal sounds
characteristic of all country towns even the background noise of this city didn't
reach us everything was as if static extraordinarily still so he said no
birds chirping no bugs nothing now the photographer Roberto was
snapping photographs and as he was doing this using a flash camera which illuminated
the area because it was dark this is when they noticed a short humanoid
figure dressed in black from head to toe moving very quickly but just a short
distance away and as selio says the entity moved quickly but silently as if skiing it
flew over the ground heading towards the tall bushes that border the clearing on the Sea Side so the photographer was
snapping photos lighting up the area with these flashes while selio and the
others rushed towards the area where they had seen this figure now they couldn't see him they couldn't find
anything and after some time of searching around they decided they were going to just pack up and go home and
this is when another identical looking figure or perhaps the same one appeared
and when they saw it everyone rushed towards the figure as steio says the individual was
moving quickly towards the bush area we gained ground and when we came within a
few steps of him we had him here it was reached when he disappeared before he
had even reached the hedges what left us particular ly astonished was the manner
in which it disappeared it quickly disappeared from our sight as if it were
gradually becoming invisible from the bottom up now even when it was no longer
visible they could hear it moving through the brush they could hear footsteps they could hear branches they
could also hear a breathing sound now during all of this time there was some pretty intense fear panic and confusion
among the group two of the witnesses actually fainted dead away one had a
severe emotional breakdown one of them a geology student had brought a guy counter and he said it
quote ticked like mad now not longer after this being
disappeared at around 10:20 p.m. the entire group did see a glowing object
move overhead later returning to the site they did find a group of roundish
footprints or Landing traces of some kind but more amazing was when they looked at
the photos they found one which showed the figure that they had all seen you
can see it here and while this photo is somewhat blurry with so many witnesses
it appears to be entirely genuine selio and the others did make a
report to the police who took the report very seriously they verified the photograph they conducted an
investigation uh so this got quite a bit of attention and it was around this time that rumors began to spread that the
group had seen nothing more than an escaped dwarf from a traveling circus
that had been in the laspia area some days earlier this is a claim by the way
which the group veh denies they said what they saw was not an escaped circus
dwarf the police didn't vestigate this rumor but we not able to confirm it in any way so this just appears to be a
simple debunk in effort at any rate this did cause quite a bit of attention selio
and the others later returned to the same spot in August 8th of 1977 and UFOs showed up they had in fact
an interactive encounter with this UFO as selio says in part at 10:56 we saw in
the sky a luminous Source exactly 1 minute later we saw
another luminous emission in the same spot so we chose to answer it if signals came
as an answer from the sky two more signals and two more answers in all we
signaled five more times which were regularly answered by the vehicle so how
amazing is that I think that case especially the second one would qualify as a C5 a close encounter of the fifth
kind or a human initiated contact given that they went out there to investigate
UFOs and what should show up but an ET and no I don't think it was an escaped
circus dwarf I found I found that actually kind of amusing people will
often go to ridiculous lengths to explain away an encounter and I think that's probably what's going on here
because the way the witnesses described this figure it does not sound like an escaped circus dwarf to me because an
escaped circus dwarf who was never confirmed by the way simply cannot float around or disappear right in front of
your eyes and just the description given does not match a person as we would
think of it a normal human here on Earth so yeah a super interesting case with
all kinds of interesting elements to it of course the photograph and the landing traces and the fact that there were so
many witnesses I mean 15 in that second case provides a level of credibility to
it that makes it pretty much impossible to deny ey that something very unusual
happened and now let's move to the next case I wanted to include this one because we get such a wide variety of
descriptions of humanoids I have to tell you this one is off the charts strange
when it comes to descriptions I call this one a purple-haired
alien now it's true the witness was quite frightened so perhaps he wasn't
observing as carefully as he may have otherwise you can make up your own minds about it this case occurred on March 13
1978 in VR fora Portugal and it's quite
an amazing encounter as you'll see this case was investigated by the Centro De
estudos astronomicos a phenos insolitos which is basically the study
of astronomy and unknown phenomena this group was founded by waim Fernandez who
you can see here and this is somewhat a briefcase but so unusual it deserves to
be more well known with the morning of March 13
1978 as a 10-year-old student by the name of claudo Franco was at his primary
school located at the end of the small village of V Formosa this is just south
of Almeida in Portugal clao had to relieve himself so he left class and
went to the B bathroom which was located at the rear of the building as he exited
the bathroom he said somebody or something pushed him on his back so hard
that he was pushed right to the floor and turning around he got an incredible shock because he saw this strange figure
standing there that clearly was not human it did appear to be a male
humanoid very short in stature but its face was really strange it looked badly
scarred or very wrinkled it had curly purple hair and was wearing a skintight
white coverall which flared out below the knees it wore no shoes it was
barefoot and strapped to its waist was a belt with this box shaped device with
what looked like buttons on it so Claudia lay there absolutely stunned
stared at this figure in numb shock or a few minutes at least trying to regain
his senses and finally realizing that this was absolutely unusual he began screaming in
absolute fear and it was at this moment that the figure put one of its hands on
the device that was strapped around its waist and this figure suddenly became engulfed in a flash of colorful lights
and it promptly disappeared claudo was so overwhelmed by all this that he was actually unable to
stand up he had to crawl over to a nearby well and he was still screaming
for help finally a teacher heard him and arrived claudo said that the entire
incident lasted about 10 minutes that's a long time and there were some after
effects from all this following the incident claudo suffered from back pain
and they found strange burn-like marks which appeared on his back and these were accompanied by a burning sensation
but they only lasted for a few days how about that for high strangeness a really
unusual humanoid of course there are physiological effects which are hard to
explain away or you know fake so this witness did have some physical effects
from his experiences and was certainly emotionally affected as well I find it
really interesting because this case did take place at a school and as you may know I've done a
series of episodes on schoolyard encounters and also wrote entire book which covers more than 100
cases which took place at schools so there might be a connection there as
well it's certainly a fascinating case and now we move to another case which I
had to include because it is so unusual I call this one we love you of course
this is a quote directly from the ETS this case occurred on October 14
1978 in be Val Valley Colorado this is a suburb of Denver and this is a fascinating case
which does involve multiple Witnesses and some really interesting I guess you
call it psychic effects and emotional effects as well it's just a really
unusual case as we'll see October 14 1978 turned out to be a very interesting
day for Peggy Otis it started out great I mean she remarked on it she was having
a great day earlier she had taken five friends to visit a psychic who lived
nearby her home in Denver Colorado and after that she was outside her home she
actually told this little boy who lived down the street quote I feel so good today something is going to happen to me
she was just kidding or so she thought but it turned out she wasn't those words
turned out to be very prophetic cuz it was later that night she would have one
of the most shocking experiences of her life that night she went to visit a
friend in be Valley this is a suburb of Denver and she brought along her young
granddaughter Jenny with her and they had the visit and as they drove home
Jenny became sleepy she laid down her head on Peggy's lap and Peggy was about
eight blocks from her home and was driving South down South windir Street
and approaching Kaye Avenue as you can see here when something very unusual
happened and I'll just let Peggy describe it in her own words as she says
I saw this thing like an airplane but it had Sparks coming out from under it I
thought that's an airplane that is going to land on me so I turned the corner and
went about 300 ft just as I did I saw this Dome and so I stopped and got out
of my car I stood in the middle of the street screaming my lungs out I wanted Jennifer
her granddaughter to wake up and look out the window just as she got up and
looked out the windshield I saw this it was massive it went over the top of me
it looked like the deck of a ship I was really petrified I crawled back into the
car and just as I started to get into the car I looked up at the moon and I
saw two angels floating in the moon and then they disappeared I got into the car
and I sat down and looked at Jenny I thought I was losing my mind I really
thought I was having a nervous breakdown or freaking out there is a church close by and I looked over at some people by
the church and they didn't even see it I don't think they even looked up and saw
it so yeah she saw these weird Angels this might be a screen memory as we'll
see but the encounter wasn't over yet cuz Peggy looked ahead of her and saw the
object again it was still admitting what looked like Sparks but it was now hovering a few blocks ahead right over
South Broadway as you can see here she raced up the street and just as she got
there the object vanished right in front of her eyes again Peggy could hardly
believe it as she says I really doubted my sanity all the time
I thought I was cracking up so she turned around she had passed her street she went to her home on Long
View Street and told her husband what happened thankfully he was very supportive and they ended up staying up
half the night listening to the radio and watching TV hoping to see if anyone
reported anything nobody did she did call the local airport and asked if they
had seen any UFOs they thought she was crazy they said know they hadn't now the next morning Peggy was
using the garbage disposal which makes a humming noise and her little granddaughter Jenny said that's the way
it sounded and as Peggy says and it was that was exactly the way it sounded it
sounded like a hum so she and her granddaughter Jenny both remembered this
object making a humming sound Jenny did recall seeing the object too and she
told Peggy that their had been a red car ahead of them with a family inside she saw them stop look up at the craft get
all scared and then race away now Peggy didn't see the car she was paying too
close attention to the object but she does remember hearing it Screech away at high
speed now this is interesting because at the time of her encounter Peggy was taking a local parapsychology class she
decided she would share her sighting with her fellow students who encourage her to tell the teacher she agreed she
told him what happened he kind of gave her a strange look she asked do you believe me and he said yes I do and he
shared that his own niece had a similar experience now despite having another
witness and other people talking about this Peggy still felt some doubt as she
says when it happened it took me a long time to really I I just couldn't believe
I had seen it I thought that I had gone crazy I thought this is it I am cracking
up so it affected her quite profoundly in fact her health began to suffer as
Peggy says I had real bad Health that winter I was a bundle of nerves ever since it happened I was in the hospital
three or four times they put me on a heart monitor my heart would just go crazy they said nothing was wrong with
me they ran every type of test they could on me so they nothing was wrong with her it
was apparently just this very strong emotional reaction she couldn't get it out of her head and two years later she
decided to go under hypnosis she contacted doct Leo sprinkle
PhD and under hypnosis did recall some other details she recalled that she had
actually received communication from little gray beings now she didn't have
any not missing time she didn't recall being taken on board or anything like
this but she did recall having telepathic Impressions from this little man with a whitish gray head and slanted
eyes in fact there were several of them aboard the craft she says and one in particular was speaking to her and as
Peggy says they gave me three messages they said we love you we'll be back
don't forget us and in fact they also had a few other things to say as Peggy says they told me
to go into the psychic to study the psychic world so I did I was taking
parapsychology then so I have been giving readings and I have a group every
week that comes to the house we have a lot of strange things happen but I'm
still not well one of the things they told me was this leave Littleton
Colorado because the pollution is so bad so they gave her some advice and as
she says so that's our next move we are going to move out of Littleton and I
think I'll feel better Peggy also said that after this encounter she began to
have impressions of past lives which she connects directly to her experience how
amazing is that case and yet it fits the pattern we see in many other cases I do
think it is probably one of the ET goals to wake us up to our psychic abilities
so to have the ETS tell Peggy flat out that you should pursue psychic development definitely fits the pattern
here it's also interesting to me that they told her that she needs to move out of the city it's too polluted where she
lives this is something that turns up in a number of cases there's just some really interesting elements to that
whole case which by the way we very nearly didn't hear about because Peggy
did present her experience at the Rocky Mountain UFO conference but almost
backed out the last minute she decided it was important to share her experience
and I'm glad she did because again each case adds to our knowledge of what's going on here and her case certainly I
think has some important insights and takeaways and now let's move to the next
case I call this one my world would never again be the same and this is of
course is something a lot of witnesses Express an encounter can change
everything and boy was this a very close-up encounter and so unusual this
one took place one evening in August 1979 in Su Maine it is a multiple
witness case it's got actually more than one event but it's rare to see a UFO
this close up and a humanoid and what an unusual
humanoid and really the behavior as well is quite unusual so I think you'll find
it quite an interesting case it was around 1 p.m. one evening again in
August of 1979 and Miss hm Dickinson had just
invited a friend to her home her home overlooks Patton Bay as you can see here
again in sui Maine now her friend had just arrived came out onto the porch
where Miss Dickinson was sitting and then he stopped in his tracks looked up and shouted out what's that Miss
Dickinson jumped to her feet she looked out over the bay and was shocked to see a strange object which wasn't far in
fact it was only a few feet away from her house and from her she said it was
so close that as she said any closer it would have scraped the paint this object was was quite small it
was this very small transparent craft dimly lit with yellow light kind of like
a candle light and as Miss Dickinson says it was just big enough for one
occupant and shaped like an antique Mazda Edison electric light bulb I know
I have a couple believe me after that few seconds I knew my world would never
again be the same there was a whole universe full of new activity in which I had be come
involved now I had seen a number of lovely spacecraft but as long as they were way up in the sky they did not
concern me this however was another matter so she saw this thing very close
and the most shocking part of it was this weird occupant which sat on a
box-like chair was holding a pole or what looked like she interpreted as some
sort of steering device and I was looking directly at her she had some difficulty describing this being in some
ways it looks like the typical gray but she said its head head had a quote
layered bandage look kind of reminded her of a wasp's nest in a weird way she
said it also looked a bit like the India prime minister jawar Halal
Neu and as Miss Dickenson says he reminded me of nou with his tight
britches and the slightly cut shoulder of his tunic
she said this this figure was very thin she says ever so slight skinny said he
was so skinny that he could have quote been made of pipe cleaners now this craft was right next
to the porch right next to the house and she said that it had to do some quote
fancy steering just to miss the elm tree which overhung the porch this craft made
no noise whatsoever but it was so close that she got really good close-up look
at it and the figure inside she said this figure was sitting slightly turned
not quite in profile but did turn his head almost mechanically to observe her
and she estimated that it was no more than three or 4 feet tall again I'll
just let her describe in her own words as she says he turned like a porcelain
doll swivel-head also he sat straddling what appeared to
be a Square for Mica box either white or pale blue his right hand was extended
forward to a control panel which was in true profile I could make out no levers
or meters his head was shaped like Nefertiti his eyes were a slant up at
the outer Corners I saw no nose or mouth for this reason I believe him to Be
unisex although I did not visually explore the possibility of a drop seat
he was right-handed that hand being extended forth to the control panel his left arm sort of hung at his side his
feet hardly touched the floor similar to a child's too large
chair now miss Dickinson speculates s she had this impression that he did not
eat and sort of sustained himself through osmosis it's not sure why she feels this way she really only viewed
him for a moment when suddenly the entire craft and occupant disappeared
as Miss Dickinson says he's simply turned off like a switch had I known
that I would have run for a closet he had a fine opportunity to look at humans
at close range we resembled fish with our eyes popping and our mouths hanging
open so lucky for her she did have another witness but she was still reluctant to talk about it but several
nights later she saw it again this time hovering by her neighbors TCH and back
field and he saw it too so she was now so impressed by these two events that
she decided to make a report to the center of UFO studies qos who published
it in the qos associates newsletter can you imagine just sitting out there on
your back porch and having a UFO come flying by that close and having this humanoid turn and look at you it's
really unusual and this is another case that we almost didn't hear about and probably
wouldn't have if this UFO didn't come back for a second appearance and show off itself to the neighbor so this just
goes to show these experiences are probably a lot more common than we hear
about because many people will report a sighting uh but if it involves a
humanoid people are much less likely to talk about it for fear of ridicule and
disbelief thanks that's changing this is one of the reasons why I put out these episodes so that people can know we're
not alone many people are having these experiences and now we move to another
encounter this is a pretty shocking one uh this one wasn't fully investigated it
just comes from a gentleman who reported it to the newspaper but it does have some really interesting confirmation to
it I call this one I never believed in Aliens this took place early one morning
in February of 1981 in a rural area of Westfield North
Carolina and I think you'll find this case absolutely compelling and certainly
fascinating and really unique and unusual the witness in this case is
anonymous and again he sent a letter to the Mount Ary North Carolina news
writing you may think I'm crazy stupid or just telling you a fib but what I'm
about to tell you actually happened I have never believed in aliens or Monsters but I don't know what it was
that I saw it was in early February 1981 as this man who lives on a rural Farm on
the outskirts of Westfield went to go milk his cows around
dusk his hunting hound dog joined him as he usually does but then his dog started
barking and sniffing and then took off as though chasing a rabbit or something
this was not unusual the farmer finished milking his cow and then went to follow
his dog up this hill next to a wooded area it was now pretty much completely dark but the farmer did have a
flashlight and as he came upon his dog he saw that his dog was fighting with
some kind of creature and he was not at all prepared for what he saw as the
farmer says I was 30 ft or maybe a little more away from him at first I
thought he was with another animal but when I saw what he had almost chewed up I was so scared that I almost
froze I don't know what this was I don't know whether it was a person animal or
what it had no hair on its head or body it was only about 5T tall it had pink
skin a very large head and small frog-like hands and feet it had two
large eyes and no nose or mouth the best I could tell was wearing a dress or robe
I looked at it for only a few seconds it seemed to still be alive but where my
Hound had chewed on him I saw no blood at all my dog had mangled both his legs
and one of his arms I think it was his right arm after I examined it for a few
seconds I ran back to my home as fast as I could locked my doors got in my car
and headed for Mount Ary I spent the night at a motel right behind the Diner
Burger so yeah this traumatized him so bad he left his dog behind he locked his
house and spent the night away from his house now he did return the next day and
sadly found that his dog had passed away he also noticed that two of his cows were
missing whatever it was that his dog had attacked was now gone and he did not
talk about what happened for 2 weeks but finally contacted the newspaper because
he wanted to know if anyone else had seen anything around this time and as he
wrote in his letter I haven't told anyone about this you're the only ones
I've told this story to if I told anyone what I had seen that night they would
think I was joking or had a nut loose in my head the reason I am telling this is
that maybe someone else has seen what I've seen now following the publication of
the man's letter in the mount ARY News in fact another witness did come
forward the gentleman by the name of Odell Harold said that he and several
others saw a UFO just days after the farmers encounter said the object
hovered over the Industrial Park area was silent at first very low to the
ground much too low to be a conventional aircraft it had three rows of
lights and as Odell Herold says it looked like nothing I had ever seen at
night he said it moved off towards Hobson it made a low pitched roaring
noise now back in 1973 when there was a whole bunch of humanoid reports there
were in fact three separate humanoid reports in this general area I do wish
we had more followup on that case but unfortunately it ends there so it's hard to say what happened next but certainly
a compelling case for a number of reasons I'm glad this farmer did decide
to come forward because he didn't have to I really wonder what happened to the ET in this case such an unusual report I
don't think I've heard anything quite like it but by all counts it does appear
to be a genuine and legitimate case and certainly not the only ET report in this
area in fact I've covered a couple of them um from the mount Ary North
Carolina area in previous episodes so this is a new one that fits right into
this area not sure what's going on in this area to bring so many amazing humanoid reports but there it is and now
we move to the next case also super fascinating uh also a multiple witness
Case by the way uh I call this one we come from very far away this is a direct
quote from the apparent ETS and quite a compelling and really unusual series of
events with this lady seeing an ET in a very public place just basically walking
down the street uh this case took place on February 6th 1991 in chevil France
this case was investigated by a leading French researcher Joel Menard who's also
the editor of the very respected publication lumier Donan lights in the night the
main witness is known only as Sylvia the time of her encounter she lived on Ru
Alexis minol this borders the mudon forest in shvil France you can see it
here it was on the night of February 6 1991 that she and her two friends Gilda
and Michelle were walking along the edge of the ersen pond which you can see here
and Gilda surprised the other two by asking them if they believed in UFOs and
she immediately pointed to This brilliant star-like object hovering in the Western sky and said do you see that
star there well that is not a star it's a UFO now Sylvia wasn't sure what to think
of this Proclamation and after a short while of watching this object all three of them
returned to their homes but Sylvia said she felt this very strange and strong
compulsion which really surprised her to go return to the pond and look for this
object which she did and she quickly spotted it she watched it for a few
moments when it did something strange it suddenly moved darting at acute angles
forming a sort of triangular pattern then for reasons she can't
describe she decided to go home and take the longer and more isolated Forest path
home this is when suddenly a light appeared to her left now she turned
towards it thinking perhaps it was a Street Lamp but it wasn't because suddenly it struck her with a beam of
Light which caused a very strange feeling made her feel very light almost
as if she was being levitated as Sylvia says my body was
seized with fizzing Sensations like a caress on the skin and that each spot of
my nervous system was being sucked up this gave a feeling of lightness and attraction I was scared and I cried to
myself Sylvia go home something very serious will happen to
you so maybe there's more to this encounter here but what in any case she
became quite afraid and she started running towards home she noticed that as
she did this beam of light seemed to follow her briefly but once she got home
she was able to calm down she finally went to bed but it was shortly later she woke up to an even stranger
experience when she woke up she instantly noticed that her blankets and sheets were all piled up and standing by
the side of her bed was a 3 to 4ft tall humanoid figure wearing a greenish
jumpsuit it looked back at her with an expression of surprised as if it had not
expected her to wake up it then looked to the left and Sylvia had some trouble
understanding and believing what she saw next as Sylvia says I saw appear as on a
screen the interior of his spaceship there behind a long
semicircular table stood the whole general staff of the ship it seemed
there were only men there they wore costumes identical to those of airline pilots with dark suits and caps they had
an air of pride in themselves then the men fell backwards a step and disappeared and so did the
screen so silia was now alone in her room and after calming down again she
went back to sleep but no surprise her experiences weren't over yet the next
morning she had to work and as she left to go to work she looked up at the sky
and surprised herself by sending out a mental message saying will you return
one day from where you come and what do you do on Earth this really surprised
her she wasn't expecting herself to do this but she was even more surprised when she received an immediate
telepathic response which said it is a tedious Journey we come
from very far away we can come only approximately every 30 years we come to
make studies on the Green Planet so that was the message she got and things still
weren't over yet she continued walking to work and as she approached the bus
stop she noticed a very strange figure who both looked strange and was dressed
strangely and did not appear to be human this figure wore a large Cape it had an
oversized hairless head dark gray wrinkly skin and a very thin emaciated
body in fact it looked at her this was still some distance away but close enough that she got a good look at it
she said it scowled at her menacingly and then quickly dematerialized her it
frightened her really badly to the point she said that if it had been any closer she felt like it might have destroyed
her body and soul and that was it but there was an interesting end note to all this because
the next weekend she went to visit her extended family who really surprised her
by saying that they had just had a UFO encounter turned out a few days earlier
they were driving from veizi to chevil and saw two low flying objects which
appear to be triangular in shape now encouraged Sylvia shared her
own encounters which quite shocked her relatives after that she did keep quiet
she just didn't talk about it but many years later thinking about what happened she felt this wave of fear about it and
decided to contact researchers but she doesn't admit that since this series of
events nothing else has happened to her so how amazing is that with three people
seeing this UFO and the witness deciding you know what I'm going to go back and check this out it's really interesting
because we do see this in quite a few cases where people don't react quite the
way they thought they would for example she took a different path home the long
way around through the forest why did she do that and this ended up in having
a major encounter Not only was there this sighting but she ended up having this face-to-face encounter with
humanoids in her bedroom this is another pattern we see what might start out as a
simple sighting suddenly escalates into deeper levels of contact and of course
communication as well so a really compelling case and now we move to the
last one in this little compilation this one is probably my favorite of the bunch
just cuz it's a multiple witness case it's so poignant I mean these Witnesses
were affected so profoundly by what they saw I call this one the aliens followed
them home this occurred on December 19 2015 in a rural area of orania Chile and
wow what an amazing case this is uh I think the most unusual aspect is the
appearance of the e but how they behaved following these Witnesses home really unusual well let's
just get started and you'll see this last and final case was featured on the Spanish YouTube channel what lives in
the shadows and this was actually submitted to that channel by a viewer
who insisted upon absolute anonymity it was later published on the
geo.com website the Witnesses are two brothers Miguel age 24 a college student and his
younger brother Patrizio age 14 Miguel had recently arrived home from college
so he could spend some time with his family and he had just arrived home only
recently when his little brother asked if they could take a bike ride through
the paths of the forest near their rural no it was a hot day so Patricio
suggested that they leave their bikes behind hide them in the bushes and Go off into the forests to cool off in one
of the many freshwater Springs and creeks in this area so they did they hid
their bikes and went hiking for a while it started to get late so they decided
to return and this is when they heard this strange sound behind them kind of
like rocks or Stones being struck or grinded together they turned around and
they saw a sight which filled them with instant fear because standing not far away away from them were two beings and
they were huge they estimate about 9 ft tall or more that very long arms were
dressed in full body green overalls but both boys were mostly shocked by the
being's faces uh these were not normal human looking beings they had a very big mouth
they stared intently at them with this terrifying kind of mocking expression also very strange both boys
felt this intense heat coming from the beings very strong almost like standing next to a campfire in fact the older one
Miguel was so shocked he fell flat on his back and just sort of lay there on
the forest floor unable to move while his younger brother 14-year-old Patrizio
stood there paralyzed and crying in fear after just a few moments of this with
these beings staring at them Miguel jumped up grabbed his little brother by the arm and they began to R run as fast
as they could away from these beings they were falling and stumbling and getting all scratched up by the branches
because these beings began to follow them Miguel says he never ran so hard he
found himself filled with adrenaline as they both ran straight home as fast as
they could completely abandoning their bikes so they made it home and they
immediately began to lock the doors and windows while their poor concerned mother repeatedly asked them what was
wrong the younger patrio was too frightened to even speak and Miguel was
explaining what happened when all of them heard this strange sound again
coming from outside now Miguel and his mother very carefully and fearfully
approached the window and saw these same two beings standing only about 35 ft
away right outside the house apparently communicating with each other and pointing at the house again there was
still that strange sound of grinding rocks going on all of them became filled
with fear in fact the mother knelt down to the ground and began to cry and pray
patrio was still strucken with fear Miguel had the presence of mind to close the curtains go to the kitchen and grab
a knife and for the next few hours these beings remained outside seeming to
inspect the surroundings while these loud noises continued finally their father who
worked at a Lumber Company arrived in a van and looking outside these beings were
gone they told the father what happened he was initially quite skeptical but could see that something had happened he
demanded that Miguel accompany him back into the forest to retrieve the bikes they had abandoned they couldn't find
the bikes not at first but they did find strange marks on the ground and broken bushes and trees where the
boys had seen these strange beings following this incident
14-year-old Patrizio began to suffer from nightmares and insomnia he refused
to sleep in the dark he needed to have a light on it got so bad he ended up
undergoing psychiatric treatment the mother was still scared so she brought in a Catholic priest to
bless the house thankfully there were no other en en counters but the incident
did cause quite a bit of strife between Miguel and his father this is a good example this case
I think of how frightening an encounter can be people just aren't expecting to see something like that and when they're
confronted with it and it completely shatters their world view in an instant it can be quite traumatic then to have
these things actually chase them home through the forest I mean that has to be
pretty scary especially when they remained outside their home for over an
hour so I don't blame them for you know having a strong emotional reaction it's
a shame that it did cause some stress in terms of the family relationships but
this again is another pattern we see and why it's so important to investigate
these kinds of cases and get the word out that these things can happen so people will be more prepared for the
possibility of these kinds of events but another really unusual case with very
tall humanoids just a lot of details that are super interesting all right that's it for
today 10 cases from all over the world from 1950s up to
2015 as you can see all different types of ETS short little dwarf-like beings
Grays human looking ETS really tall beings
all different kinds of beings but pretty much humanoid without exception which
has really important implications and I think speaks again to the fact that we
are all connected as so many contact have been told we all share a common
Heritage and that's what these cases I think really speak loudly
and I think it's one of the important takeaways actually but each case again adds to our
knowledge of what's going on again this is why I do this research I find it not
only endlessly fascinating but I think there's a lot we can learn about what's
out there beyond Earth it is my assessment that these are
extraterrestrials uh but of course I know there are other theories you can make up your own minds about it
hopefully one day we will have answers hopefully one day this stupid cover up will end and we can all talk about this
in a more public way that's accepted and removed from you know all the disbelief
fear confusion and ridicule that's surrounding this subject but until then
the research continues so thank you guys thank you very much for watching it's
because of you guys I do this show I consider you my friends I love you all very much and until next time keep
asking those hard questions keep searching for the truth and most important keep having fun I will see you
next Friday bye for now
