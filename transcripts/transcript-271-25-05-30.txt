HAVE NO FEAR: SEVEN ASTONISHING ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTERS
May 30, 2025

Summary:
May 30, 2025
Of all types of UFO encounters, the most extensive and profound are cases where people are taken onboard a craft and interact with extraterrestrials face-to-face. Thousands of these cases from across the planet have been documented, though many researchers believe they number in the millions. These cases have the most information and hold the greatest potential to answer many of the questions surrounding extraterrestrial contact. This video presents seven onboard UFO encounters. These cases involve many different types of ETs and they provide a fascinating glimpse into who these beings are, where they come from and why they are visiting our planet.

THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ALBERT LANCASHIRE. One evening in 1942, 27-year-old army officer, Albert Lancashire, stood in the guard booth at a secret radar site near Newbiggen-by-the Sea, England. Suddenly a light appeared and moved towards him, showing itself to be a disc-shaped craft. The craft struck him with a beam of light, and he passed out. When he awoke, the craft was gone. This was followed by UFO dreams, paranormal events and another UFO sighting. After many years, he recalled being lifted into the craft, examined, and then returned.

THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF PAMELA WIMMER. In 1975, Pamela Wimmer (age 22) was at her home in Dresden, Maine when she heard her child scream from the front yard. She ran outside and saw a huge saucer-shaped craft. It moved off, but it reminded her that, at age 10, she and a friend were chased home by a craft. At age 14, three small grays pulled her from her bed, into a craft parked in front of her house. Inside, she was given a physical exam, saw weird star-charts, and was shown the Earth floating in space. The ETs asked her if she would like to go with them. Pamela declined, and they brought her home.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF SUSAN. In 1968, “Susan,” (age 9) was playing with friends near their homes in Port Augusta, South Australia when they saw odd lights hovering overhead. One year later, she was in her bedroom in Adelaide when three short figures and one tall one arrived and pulled her onboard a craft. She was physically examined. They showed her images of a planet experiencing a worldwide disaster. They told her that she had important work to do on Earth. This was the first of many encounters, including a few involving intimate relations with a tall gray.

THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROBERLA T. Stepping on to the porch of her Phoenix Arizona home on the night of June 23, 1973, Roberla saw a star-like light descending. As it approached, she saw it was a strange craft. A door opened and she could see a tall humanoid figure. She passed out. Years later, she went under hypnosis and recalled that the figure approached her and levitated her into the craft where she was physically examined.

THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF FRANCESCO OJEDA. On March 3, 1976, twelve-year-old Francesco Ojeda went missing near his home in rural Fortaleza, Brazil. Two days later, he was found by his parents wandering in the forest, burned and unable to see. He recovered his sight. He said that while walking home from school, he came upon a landed craft and two small humanoids. They entered into the craft which stuck him with a beam of light. He passed out and woke up onboard the craft. The ETs examined him, said they meant him no harm, and told him that ETs were visiting Earth in large numbers.

THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DR SIMON TAYLOR & REZA. On September 16, 1976, Simon Taylor and his friend Reza went camping tin the Elburz Mountains near Tehran, Iran. In the middle of the night they were woken up by three dark-suited figures with large eyes who led them into a craft. Inside they sat on a Persian rug while the craft took them on a tour around planet Earth. They were returned miles from where they were taken. Both were forever changed by their shared encounter.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER UFO ENCOUNTER OF TATIANA MIKHAYLOVONA. Walking to her home in Protvino, Russia, on the evening of September 13, 1989, Tatiana Mikhalovona was startled by two tall women in silver jumpsuits who approached her. She was unable to resist as they led her to a landed flying saucer and took her onboard. They asked if she’d like to go for a short ride. Tatiana didn’t want to, but the beings convinced her. Tatiana was amazed when she looked out of the porthole of the craft and saw the city lights below her. After a 10-minute ride, they returned her to Earth and promised to meet her again.

These seven cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but these alone provide an accurate representation of what it’s like to be taken onboard an ET craft and meet ETs face-to-face. There are so many cases with remarkable commonalities, coming from all over the world, that they are impossible to deny or explain away. They provide powerful testimony that we are being visited by a wide variety of beings from beyond Earth.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and thank you for joining me for a new episode of UFOs in the
Paranormal. Today I'm going to be talking about what I think is the most interesting type of UFO encounter. It's
certainly the most extensive and that is of course onboard UFO experiences. The
title of today's episode is Have No Fear. Seven astonishing onboard UFO
encounters. I think these cases are really important. They certainly represent the cutting edge of UFO
research. They have the most information more than any other type of encounter perhaps except UFO crash retrievals. But
in these cases, people get to interact directly with the ETSs. And I've said
this before, but it bears repeating. These are the kinds of cases that hold
the most potential to answer the many questions surrounding extraterrestrial contact, such as who are these visitors
to our planet? Where do they come from? And why are they here? So, I've chosen
seven cases for you today. Probably you haven't heard of most of these. I do
like digging up those more obscure cases. And the seven cases I've chosen for you today come from all over the
world, including England, Australia, Iran, Russia, Brazil, and two from the
United States, including Arizona and Maine. These do involve quite a variety
of ET types. Some really good evidence to support some of these encounters.
Some are multiple witness. Only two of them involve the use of hypnosis. So these are largely consciously recalled
which I think is important because any excuses of false memory syndrome can be
easily laid to rest. Many of people absolutely remember their encounters
fully consciously and even the two involving hypnosis both recalled seeing
humanoids. So yeah, hypnosis does not explain these encounters by any means.
So yeah, some really interesting and fascinating cases. I love talking about onboard encounters. I find them again
endlessly fascinating. So let's just get started with our first case which I call
the onboard UFO encounter of Albert Lancashier. This is quite an early case.
It took place in September of 1942 in Newan by the Sea, England. And this is
an astonishing case because it does involve a military officer. Uh he did
not recall his encounter at first. It came back in dreams and flashbacks sometime after his encounter. But it's
certainly an interesting and important case, if only because it's one of the earliest. And in fact, it has been
called the earliest onboard UFO encounter in the UK. So that alone makes
it significant. This case comes from pioneering English researchers Lionel
Beer, Jenny Randles, and several others. It's appeared in several journals and
books. It was a cold evening in September of 1942. This is the middle of
World War II, by the way, as Albert Lancashier, a 27-year-old Army sentry
guard, stood in his guard booth guarding a secret radar base located about 2
miles from Newigan by the Sea in England. This is at the Creswell radar
site. He was armed with a loaded rifle and bayonet, but had been given explicit
orders not to fire at any enemy aircraft, as this would give away the location of the secret base. Suddenly,
an unidentified yellow light appeared low on the horizon over the ocean just
about 350 ft away. He stepped out of his booth and kept his eye on it when it
became obscured by a dark cloud. Moments later, it or another light appeared and
this time it was moving even closer. So he thought to himself, "What have the Germans invented now?" He's not thinking
UFOs. UFOs are the farthest thing of from his mind. He's never heard of them. UFOs is a subject that hadn't made its
appearance in the public consciousness quite yet. So as this thing approached,
he saw that it wasn't just a light. It was a strange round craft of some kind.
The light was coming from the rim of this craft. Now, concerned that whoever was piloting this craft might see him,
he stepped back into his sentry box. The craft then moved closer and lower. And
this is weird. Albert now felt strangely compelled to step outside the guard booth, and no sooner had he stepped out
when this object sent down a beam of light about a foot wide onto the ground,
and before he could react, it swept towards him and struck him in the face. He automatically threw his hands up
towards his face to protect himself. And as he says, "I don't remember putting my
rifle down, but I must have because it was loaded and had a bayonet attached. I
didn't use the rifle because we weren't allowed to. I just put my hands up. So,
as this light hit him, Albert says he felt a strange floating sensation and then he promptly blacked out. After an
undetermined period of time, he woke up to find himself lying on the ground several feet from where he had been
standing. He was pretty dazed and disoriented. And as Albert says, I lay
there for five or 10 minutes. I didn't know what had happened. Again, he'd never heard of UFOs, flying saucers, or
missing time. So, he really had no way of interpreting what he had just experienced. He did have the distinct
sense that this was not natural. This object was not of this world. And for some time afterwards, he wondered if
this might have been a kind of religious experience. He does say that sometime after this he
did develop an unexplained rash on his tongue and he would later wonder if it had something to do with this encounter.
But over the next few years he started having dreams about this incident. In
one dream he found himself inside a strange craft looking out a large window
down at the ocean while a man dressed in a white uniform informed him that he had
had to carry him into the ship. In a second dream, he remembered that he was
on the ship again where he met a woman with red hair wearing a short skirt and
she handed him a pair of goggles. So these were just dreams, but he connected
it to this experience. 25 years passed and this is
when he experienced a series of unusual paranormal events which somehow
triggered his memory of being taken on board this craft all those years ago.
This began in 1967. He was laying in bed one evening when he noticed a tiny pinpoint of light
over the bedroom door. It quickly became brighter and larger and coalesed into
the image of a man's head and face. This head had black hair. The face had high
cheekbones, a thin beard. The face was tilted upwards and was immobile, though
the eyes did move continuously from side to side. and after just a few minutes it
faded away and was gone. Needless to say, he found this very puzzling. But
shortly after that, something else happened. He was on duty at his job. He
was now working as a signal man for the British Rail and he was in his signal box in the evening when he suddenly felt
a presence and suddenly a brilliant light appeared just a few feet from him.
He said it was so bright it hurt his eyes to stare directly at it. But seeing how strange it was, he couldn't help but
stare. And then, coalescing out of this light, he saw the head and shoulders of
a man, which he said looked like a statue carved out of white marble. There
was no real detail to it other than a black line across the top of the head.
And this image faded quickly away back into the light. And a few minutes later, the light itself faded out. So this was
weird and events were still in progress because that same month again while at
work in the signal box he saw a dark colored object with little red lights
blinking on and off and it was hovering in the sky about 300 ft away. It slowly
lowered down to about eye level at which point he's waved his arm at it and the
object promptly stopped. The red lights went out and Albert could now see that it was in fact a dome-shaped craft. It
immediately darted off at terrific speed, he said. And something else
happened just a few days later. Again, at work in his signal box, he noticed a section of one of the walls glowing
briefly with an unexplained green light. So, all these weird things were going
on. And one year later, there was another apparent UFO sighting. In December of 1968, he was in his signal
booth again when the signal man in the next booth down the way phoned him to
alert him to the presence of a bright glowing object hovering near the chimney of a large mill in that area. They could
both see it, and this object was circling around this chimney. They both watched it for just a few minutes when
it slowly moved away in a zigzagging movement, then darted away at super high speed in a straight line. And while all
this was going on, Albert started having some episodes of
ESP. So somehow these weird events broke down the walls of amnesia surrounding
his missing time encounter 25 years earlier in 1942.
Albert now recalled that when this object had approached his guard booth all those years ago and he felt
compelled to step out and was struck by that beam of light and he felt this floating sensation, he hadn't actually
passed out. Instead, he recalled that he was drawn up into the air by this beam
of light. He said it felt as if he was walking quote along the beam. Suddenly,
he was seized by what he described as pygmyized men. He said they were wearing
white suits and they carried him on board this craft. Inside he was met by a man with dark hair who seemed to be
wearing some kind of dark goggles. Albert was made to lie down on a table or a couch. And looking up, he could see
a blue domed ceiling. Next to him, he saw another table, another exam table
with an Asian-looking woman lying on it. He saw a man wearing what looked like to
him a doctor's skull cap leaning over that table. He also wore goggles. This
man turned and smiled at him in a welcoming way. Albert himself has vague
recollections of being given goggles to put on his eyes and being physically
examined by a figure wearing some kind of surgical mask. At this point, his memory fades and all
he recalls is waking up on the ground next to his booth. He did have the sense that the UFO occupants had encouraged
him to think of this experience as a dream or in some way erased his memories
from his conscious mind. But remembering all of this, he does wonder if his
chronic tongue rash was somehow related to this experience. So again, he waited years.
He waited until he was in his 70s to report this experience to UFO
researchers and he only did so after hearing about the Betty and Barney Hill case and hearing about UFOs. And again,
his case is often cited as England's first onboard UFO encounter. One of the
researchers who interviewed him, Eric Richards, says this, "Mr. Lancashier is
by no means a crank. He is absolutely sincere and clearly believes all he has
told me. He is in himself definitely sure that they had him in that UFO in
1942 and did something to him. I would say he is above average intelligence. It
is my opinion he has had genuine experiences. An incredible case I think
by anyone's measurement and it was investigated thoroughly. It's clear this
gentleman is not seeking any publicity. He kept his encounter a secret for decades. And yet, it does show many of
the patterns we see with ET contact. Particularly interesting to me is the fact that he had quite a bit of
paranormal and psychic events. So, this is something we see a lot with UFO
contacties. It's a really amazing case. And so is this next one. I call this
next case the onboard UFO encounter of Pamela Whmer. That is a pseudonym. I
interviewed this lady personally for my book humanoids and high stranges. Her case I think is quite important for a
number of reasons and it's super interesting also because she remembered
it fully consciously and was able to have a conversation with the ETSs. The
events that happened to her on board are often reported. Yet, it's really amazing
how clearly she recalled all of this. And like many people, this wasn't a
oneoff. She had experiences throughout her life. And also, she has good
evidence that this is an experience that is generational as well. Another
important pattern. So, yeah, a really interesting case in a number of ways. Emila Whimmer's encounter is one of
several onboard UFO encounters I present in my book, Humanoids and High Stranges. And again, she has elected to remain
anonymous. So, I've used this pseudonym of Pamela Whmer. Like most contacties,
she's had a lifetime of UFO encounters. And she was reminded of this one morning in
1975. At that time, she was 22 years old. She had a 2-year-old son and was
living in Dresden, Maine. This is a tiny little town. Her child was outside in
the front yard playing with her six-year-old cousin beneath an old oak tree. Suddenly, Pamela and her
brother-in-law, who was in the house, heard the children screaming. Together, they rushed outside and couldn't believe
what they saw. There was a massive craft, 200 f feet wide, saucershaped,
hovering about 40 feet above this oak tree. It was shiny silver. It had a dome
with about 20 port holes and beautiful bright colored lights blinking around the rim. They said there were red, blue,
green, and yellow. It was perfectly silent and it was tilted at an angle. It
looked to Pamela like it was tilted so it could view the children more clearly.
And as Pamela says, "I was scared to death." So she ran for her children.
They ran towards her. together. They rushed back to the porch and watched this craft for about 10 minutes when it
suddenly started to spin quickly. So quickly the colored lights blurred together and then it darted away at
lightning speed. Everyone talked excitedly about it, but all Pamela could think was not again. Her mind instantly
went back to her first sighting in 1963 when she was only 10 years old. She and
her best friend were riding their bikes home one afternoon. Their home was about
2 miles away, and this is when they both saw a giant grayish cigar-shaped craft
moving just a few hundred feet high directly over the nearby Eastern River.
They were frightened by its unusual appearance. They could not identify it, so they rode their bikes furiously home
and became even more concerned when they saw that this craft was following them. It took him almost a half an hour to get
home. So they rushed inside and they dragged out Pamela's father and he
watched it with them for just a few moments when it moved off at a slow pace down the river. So Pamela turned to her
dad and said, "What was that?" And her father replied almost casually, "I think
it was a UFO." Now Pamela had always believed in UFOs because her father, an
Air Force officer, had seen them before and talked about it. and her mother had also had encounters. The weird thing to
Pamela was this object had followed her home. So she wondered, you know, was it interested in her for some reason. And
four years later, she got her answer. And the answer was yes. It was now the summer of 1967. Pamela was 14 years old.
She had gone to bed as normal, and sometime in the early morning hours, she
woke up with a start. An eerie, heavy silence hung over the house. Something
weird was going on. She didn't see anything at first. She sat up in bed just in time to see movement on the wall
near her bed. And coming directly through the wall were three of what she
described as the weirdest looking people she had ever seen. They were very short,
three or four feet tall. They had huge bald heads, large black glistening eyes,
no visible ears, a small mouth, very small nose, pale white skin. They were
wearing light colored, skin-tight uniforms with a wide belt, and they moved right up to her bedside. She now
in hindsight recognizes them as grey type ETS, but at the time she had no
idea who these beings were. One stood in front of her while the other two gripped
her arms and began to pull her from her bed. She became very frightened and resisted. And they immediately spoke to
her telepathically in her mind, saying, "Don't be scared. You don't have to be
afraid." But Pamela was still frightened and asked them, "Where are you taking me?" And she tried to pull away from
them. They told her, "Don't do that. Stay calm. Everything will be fine. We
won't hurt you. Be calm." Despite their continued assurances, the being's
unusual appearance left Pamela quite scared. As she says, "I never knew
anything about Grays. I didn't know what it was. It could have been the devil for all I knew. I had never seen anything
like it. I never knew there was a creature out there that looked like that." I tried to resist. They had a
hold of my arms and they took me through the wall. So when that happened, she
felt this weird buzzing feeling. And to her amazement, they took her outside to her front yard, and there was a
saucer-shaped craft sitting in the middle of the road right in front of her house. There was a small ramp leading up
to an opening. And they quickly walked her up the ramp. She asked them, "Why are you taking me?" And they just
replied, "Be calm. You don't need to be afraid. Calm down." And they repeated
this over and over as they took her into the craft. Pamela found herself inside a
large round room. She said it was brightly lit, though she couldn't see any light source. It was as if the
entire room glowed. She said it was slightly cooler inside than outside. She
said the walls were a dull silver gray. In the center of the room, she noticed there was a thick column molded into the
floor and the ceiling. There were no seams anywhere in this room. On the far side of the room, there was a small
metal table with a slight lip around the edge. It was sitting on a single pedestal, again, with no seams. It was
as if it was part of the craft itself. And also, she saw a row of about a
halfozen gray beings or more staring at her, observing quietly. She had the
feeling that they were there to learn about her. At this point, her memory grows a little bit hazy. She believes
they took her to the table, put her down on the table, and gave her an examination. She doesn't really remember
that in any clear detail. What she remembers next is that they gave her a kind of tour of the craft. One of the
grays took her to the curved wall of the craft and showed her what looked to her like glowing star maps, and she asked
them, "Is that where you're from?" And the being replied that they were from a certain star system and actually gave
her the name. Pamela didn't understand the word, so she can't repeat it, but she kind of nodded anyway, as if she
understood. And then the grace told her, "You can come with us if you want to."
This kind of frightened Pamela. She didn't really want to go with them, and she told them, "No, I want to go back
home. I want to go home. I don't want to go with you." And they told her again, "Don't be afraid. You don't have to be
scared." They repeated this over and over, but this did little to assure her because all she wanted was to get out of
there and go home. But the grays kept repeating, "Calm down. Calm down. We're
not going to hurt you." One of the grays then led her over to a port hole and said, "You can look outside if you want
to." Pamela did, and she was absolutely amazed at what she saw. There was this
bright field of sparkling stars, and far below her was the Earth. As Pamela says,
I could see another UFO and stars. I was thinking, where am I? And I could see
the Earth down below. And that really scared me because I am up in a spacecraft. That's when it really scared
me to see how high up I was in the air. I don't even like heights. So, it was
now very clear to her what was happening. She was inside a UFO, same
UFOs she had seen as a kid. and these beings around her could only be aliens.
Seeing the earth so far away from her scared her. So, she turned around at
this point and saw another figure standing or walking through an arched doorway. And this one was a little
different from the smaller grays. This one was taller, about 5 1/2 ft, and looked like the others, but was much
more humanlooking. She appeared to be female, so this is probably a hybrid.
Her skin was pale. She had big dark almond eyes, though smaller than the others. Pamela saw that she had small
holes where the ears would be. She did have thin, wispy white hair, and she was wearing a long, shiny, shimmering gown.
This figure looked at her, then back at the grays, pivoted her head back at
Pamela, back and forth to the grays several times as if she was curious about what was happening. The next thing
Pamela knew, she was back in her bed. was a few hours before dawn. She lay
awake in bed waiting for the sun to rise. And when she finally heard her parents wake up, she immediately
approached them and told them what happened. Both were understandably shocked. Her mother didn't really like
the subject, didn't want to talk about it, but her father was much more open-minded and accepting, and Pamela
told him, "Thanks, Dad, because it really did happen." And following this,
there were lots of other strange incidents. Pamela did notice an unexplained healed scar on her leg. She
began to experience weird poltergeist like activity, knocking noises, objects
being moved by themselves, doors opening and closing, lights going on and off, and so forth. She also began having
weird premonitions. Once while driving with her father, she screamed at him to pull off the road, and that was just in
time to avoid a bad collision. On another occasion, she saw exactly where her uncle had lost his watch while
hiking in the forest. Now, Pamela isn't the only one in the family who started seeing UFOs
because one day her younger sister said she was walking in the woods and came upon a gigantic glowing orb. It seemed
like sooner or later, everyone in the family had seen a UFO. But time passed.
Pamela grew up. She got married. Then of course came this incident in 1975 at age
22 when she and other family members saw this 200 foot wide saucer hovering over
the oak tree in the front yard. And it was later on that same night she went to
check on her 2-year-old son in his bedroom, looked out the window, and there was another UFO. This brilliant
white light hovering about 50 ft over the nearby river. And as Pamela says, I
knew it was a UFO. What else could it be? It quickly moved off, but kind of
filled her with some concern because she was again wondering why were the UFOs so
interested in her and her family. And sure enough, one year later, she and her boyfriend were in the kitchen one night
when they both saw an object shining a brilliant beam of light through the kitchen window. So they rushed outside
to see this brilliant silent object hovering overhead, still shining this beam of light directly on them.
Frightened, they ran back inside, took refuge in the living room, and the object shown the beam on them again
through the living room window, and then it left. But it was this series of sightings that caused Pamela to start
researching the subject, and she was shocked to read accounts similar to hers. She ended up contacting Muon,
worked very briefly with an investigator who reassured her that yeah, her
experience was real and matched the accounts of others, which by then, of course, Pamela already knew. There were
long quiet periods with no UFO activity. But sooner or later, it seemed the UFOs
always came back. For example, in 1986 at age 34, she stepped outside her home
to wait for her teenage son who had gone to visit a friend and was a little bit late returning home. So, she was out
there waiting for him. And suddenly, she got the feeling of being watched. And turning around, she saw coming right
over the top of her house a quote saucer-shaped craft. She could hardly
believe how close it was this time. She estimates no more than 30 feet overhead
and she couldn't move. As Pamela says, it gave off an energy. I was tingling
all over. The tingling kind of made me feel funny. I was nervous about it. I
was kind of stuck there. I just couldn't move. It kind of made me uneasy. It was too close. It was going down my
driveway. I was glad when it took off down over the hill. So she ran inside
and told her husband who asked her why had she not told him and she explained that she couldn't. She wanted to but she
couldn't move. And it was at that point that her son came running into the house. He burst inside and said, "Mom,
you won't believe what me and my friend just saw. We saw a flying saucer." And he proceeded to describe exactly what
Pamela herself had just seen. So that seems pretty intentional. It was just a few days after this that Pamela and her
husband were lying in bed when a small white orb entered through the window and darted around in the bedroom for just a
few moments and then zoomed back out the window. Both she and her husband were
absolutely aruck. After this incident, Pamela had a feeling that she was being watched. This kept returning and for
some reason she couldn't explain. She became afraid of looking out the bathroom window. Just a few days after
this, she woke up to sense a presence in the bedroom. She felt certain that the grays were there or had been there,
though she didn't see anything. Things slowed down after that. But in 2019, her
son announced that he had seen and actually videotaped a UFO. And in fact, the account was published in the local
newspaper. One year later in 2020, Pamela had a dream that the a gray ET was looking at
her through that same bathroom window that she had been so afraid of looking outside of. So, she believes this dream
was probably a memory of a true event that had somehow been hidden in her
subconscious. But it was a gray, as she says. I guess you'd call it a typical gray with the big eyes. It was looking
back at me. So, even as late as 2020, events were still in progress. Once she
heard a soft swishing sound over the house and recognized it as the sound the UFOs sometimes make. She still had the
sensation of being watched. And she began to wonder if perhaps the ETSs had taken her genetics at some point and
that she might have an ET hybrid child or children out there. She's got good
reason for thinking this because as Pamela says, as I said, I may have
children somewhere up there. The other night, I had a dream that they came for me again and told me they wanted to show
me something. In my dream, there were these young adults, part alien looking,
part human looking. Their hair was thin and white, almost like an older person's hair. They had some weird looking
clothes on. And I said, "You are mine." and they all came to me and hugged me. I
woke up crying. So, this isn't the kind of detail I've heard from many contacties.
And it was absolutely clear to Pamela at this point that the UFOs and ETSs were
following her family for some reason. And evidence of this came shortly later in 2020. Her son called and said that
that night that he had filmed the UFO, something amazing happened, which he at first kept secret, but decided to
finally tell her. As Pamela says that same night, he said there were bugs in
the bedroom. He said, you know, they looked like a big praying mantis. He
said they just stood there and when they woke up in the morning, they were gone. He is pretty shook up about it still. So
yeah, as you can see, this is something that is ongoing in Pamela's life and her
family's life, which is more the rule than the exception with UFO Contactees. Again, her story is told in
my book, Humanoids and High Stranges. Again, this case does come from my book, Humanoids and High Stranges. I somewhat
summarized it and shortened it here. So, if you want to hear the full story, definitely check out my book. But what
an amazing case. She is really an honest and sincere witness. She tried very hard
to get all the details correct. She of course did review her chapter before it
was published in the book and didn't have any corrections but did have a few additions because again events are
ongoing. She's a really wonderful person and I absolutely am honored to share her
story with you. So thank you Pamela. I truly appreciate it. Now let's move to the next case. This
one is also very interesting. This I call the onboard UFO encounter of Susan.
Like many contacties, she prefers to remain anonymous. Totally understandable. Her case took place in
1969, one of the major onboard experiences in Adelaide, Australia. But
again, certainly not a singular event. She's had many onboard experiences
actually. What I find interesting about her case is that her experiences really
show one of the main ET agendas, as we'll see when we get into her case, but
she also shows many of these really interesting after effects, including
really pronounced psychic abilities. So, overall, a truly fascinating and
important case. This case comes from Australian researcher Keith Basterfield
and involves an anonymous witness with the pseudonym of Susan. She was born in
1959 and she was eight or nine years old when she had her first strange experience that she can remember. At the
time she lived with her family near Port Augusta in South Australia. She and her
friends were walking outside at night when they noticed a group of six unusual looking lights. They were colored white,
red, and green, but they approached and actually hovered over them at low
elevation. They became frightened by them and hid in a ditch alongside the road. She's really not sure what
happened next, but does have a vague memory trying to wake up some of her friends who had apparently fallen asleep
while she and others ran across a field fleeing the scene. It was just one or
two years later around 1969 1970 her family had moved to Adelaide and she
recalled lying in bed one evening and had a powerful premonition that they she's really not sure who were coming to
get her that night. In fact, the feeling became so strong that she convinced her
sister to switch beds with her. And sure enough, that night, Susan remembers little beings and one tall being
entering the room and taking her into another strange room where she underwent some kind of medical examination. This
was fully consciously recalled. She also remembered that they took her to another room where they showed her images of
something like a film. She couldn't really remember what and then conversed with her. She had no other memory of
this other than following this, she began having nightmares of that experience which persisted throughout
her entire teenage years. And this is when she also began to experience a wide variety of psychic and poltergeist like
paranormal events. She heard phantom footsteps moving through the house, other strange noises. Sometimes her bike
would move by itself. She'd be watching TV and suddenly she'd get a vision, a
premonition of a future event. She sometimes heard calming music coming
from no discernable source. So all these things were happening. She grew up, she
got married and sometimes she would have fights with her husband as happens. And when she got really angry, she picked up
a glass of water. It would shatter. A few times knives came out of the drawer and pointed at her husband. She heard
strange tapping noises on the ceiling. So did he. One evening, her husband saw her sleeping and she was levitated
floating above her bed. This also occurred at work. Weird events. Chairs would move by themselves, phantom
footsteps, even occasional apparitions. One time, an unseen entity pulled at
Susan's hair. Like many contactes, she does have an idetic memory. She says she
sleeps only two or three hours per night. Years passed, practically a decade, when finally Susan contacted the
UFO research of South Australia. This is a UFO research organization, and she was
put in touch with Keith Basterfield, UFO researcher, and she elected to undergo
hypnotic regression to recall what might have happened to her as a child. She was
taken back to that event at age 10 or 11 when she saw ETS coming into the
bedroom. She lay down in her sister's bed and this is when she started to feel a strange sensation of warmth and
expansion as she put it and she heard an unusual ringing sound and she immediately saw small beings and one
tall one enter the room. She said the small beings were about 4t tall with
large bald heads, large dark eyes, a small nose, a slit for a mouth, bony
looking cheeks, so your typical grays. She saw that they did have webbing between their fingers. All of them were
wearing fleshcoled one-piece outfits. She didn't see the tall being as
clearly, but she could see it was very tall, 7 feet tall, and had a normall looking nose and was wearing the same
type of suit, but had what looked like a cape and a hood over its head. So, they
walked right up to Susan's bed where her sister was sleeping, cuz they had switched beds. They appeared to be
momentarily confused that she was not there, but quickly went to the other bed and found her. The tall one began to
speak to her telepathically, saying not to be afraid and to go with them. They levitated her from her bed into a
standing position. One of the beings handed her a ball of light. So she held
that. They surrounded her and the entire group moved together through the wall
and into the yard. And suddenly Susan found herself moving up into the air on
quote invisible steps towards this bright glowing object. Soon she was surrounded by this
bright light coming from this object and found herself with the beings in a strange room. They took this small ball
of light from her hands. She was placed on a chair of some kind which quickly
reclined into a horizontal table. And then the tall entity proceeded to conduct some kind of medical
gynecological exam. She had the sense that the tall being was concerned about
something with her health. Perhaps more tall beings appeared. They made a larger
table rise up and they put her on that. She briefly passed out. When she woke
up, she felt somewhat unwell. The small beings helped her to sit up. They gave
her a warm purple colored drink to consume. She was then bathed in a green
light and the small beings pulled her from the table and had her walk around which was difficult because her legs
felt a little bit numb. But after her legs returned to normal, she was taken over to a pile of cushions on the floor
where she sat down. Some of the little grays sat next to her. And it was at this point that she started to see
moving images like a film appear on the wall in front of her. And this showed a
planet floating in space. It zoomed forward and she saw a closeup of trees in a park area and there were
more of the tall beings there and suddenly there was a major disaster going on perhaps an earthquake. She
thinks he saw that many of these beings were dying and the survivors were being lifted up into a craft. The tall being
said that he and the others were survivors of this disaster. He told her that at one point they used to live on
Earth. He said that they were interdimensional in nature. They told her that she had to return because she
had important work to do on Earth. So they stood her up, handed her this ball
of light again, and Susan found herself floating out of the craft down to her home, through the wall, and back into
the bedroom. So this is what she recalled under hypnosis. And she recalled a few other incidents as well.
She remembered being taken from a beach at age 12. At age 16, she recalled being
taken to what appeared to her to be another planet. At age 19, she was taken again. She doesn't describe these
incidents in any real detail other than to say that they involved physical gynecological
examinations and on at least one occasion intimate relations with one of the tall ETs. One of these intimate
meetings occurred in 1979 and afterwards she believed she became pregnant. She
was showing signs of food cravings, enlarged abdomen and breasts, sessation
of her cycle. Uh but then she had what she believes to be a spontaneous
miscarriage. And the same thing happened again in 1986. After another intimate session with a tall ET, she became
pregnant. This puzzled her because she knew she had not had sex with anybody, not on Earth. She began having
nightmares of having an ET baby. She became quite ill during this pregnancy
and went to the doctor who did confirm she was pregnant. But at this point he did not detect any movement in the fetus
and became concerned that perhaps it had died in uterero and very shortly later
she experienced a second spontaneous miscarriage. So, if she had all this stuff going on and one time she went to
the dentist, she got X-rays and the dentist told her that these X-rays showed two unusual objects in her upper
gums and they asked her if she had had previous dental work which Susan denied.
Years later, she had more dental X-rays which also showed these objects. These X-rays were obtained by researcher Keith
Basterfield and he could see these artificial looking foreign bodies in her
mouth himself as he said that they were straight metal pieces that appear to be
situated in her upper gums just below her nose. So Keith wrote about this case
and he leaves his interpretation open as to how to explain these events. But
again, a very interesting case. There you go. Thanks to Keith Basterfield for
bringing that case to the public attention. Really interesting regarding the implants. This is something I think
probably most contactees have. Uh I don't think that there's anything
nefarious personally to implants. My research has shown actually that they're pretty much health related. But a really
fascinating case because it does show the ET's interest in human reproduction.
So that makes this case I think significant. It's a pattern that has been fairly
wellestablished. And remember these cases are coming from all over the world from people who don't know each other
and yet are showing amazing similarities. This is corroboration. I
think um how can these people all be telling the same story and not know each other unless this is all true? And I
think it is cuz there are so many cases like these. Again, it's just not one or
two people telling these stories. It's a lot of them and almost all contactes do
have corroborating witnesses to some extent. Uh so that alone I think is a
very important fact that we really need to consider when we try to explain these cases. It's not just one person saying
this. So let's move to the next case. This one's also pretty darn interesting.
It's not as lengthy as some of the other cases, but it's super fascinating. It's
got some really interesting details to it. I call this one the onboard UFO
encounter of Roberta T. Her case was thoroughly investigated. It occurred on
June 23rd, 1973 in Phoenix, Arizona.
Phoenix has quite a lot of activity. Arizona is one of the leading producers
of UFO reports in the United States. Uh but again, UFO encounters occur
everywhere. In this case, she did use hypnosis to recover the onboard segment,
but absolutely does recall seeing humanoids and having missing time. So,
it's not like this is being made up out of whole cloth. She does remember quite a bit of her encounter and some really
interesting ones, some unique details in this one. This case comes from researchers Lester Seard and Lex
Midbane. The witness is Robera T again of Phoenix. And on June 23rd, 1973, that
evening, she stepped out onto her patio, and this is when she noticed a star-like
object descending from the sky, eventually hovering at a spot just above the trees beyond her patio. and she
could now see that it was a large solid illuminated roundish object and it was
close enough that she could hear a humming noise coming from it. She stood there watching it when a squarish
opening appeared. She described it as quote like garage doors opening. She
could now see a light streaming out from the interior of this opening. And this is when suddenly a human-like figure
approached the opening from one side. He proceeded to cross to the other side. then bent down to quote do something.
This surprised her enough that she exclaimed out loud. And apparently this being heard her because he abruptly
leaned out of the opening and stared directly at her. He was only visible
from the knees up, but she could see that he was wearing a skintight suit of some kind. He dropped his head slightly,
and as he looked at her, she could see that he was tall with a large head. It looked to her like, quote, "He was
messing around with some instruments." Suddenly, she heard another humming noise, and looking off
to her left, she saw a second, smaller object approaching. It moved off behind
the post and disappeared. And immediately looking back to the first object with the humanoid in it, she saw
that it too had vanished. At this point, still on her porch, she unaccountably
fell asleep and upon awakening was puzzled to find that she was in a different position. So thinking about
this years later, she decided to contact a UFO group called the ground saucer
watch and after speaking with investigators decided to undergo hypnotic regression. And under hypnosis,
she relived this sighting. And then instead of this object disappearing, she
saw that the figure she had seen in the doorway of the craft was now standing directly before her on the patio. This
being told her not to be afraid, and she suddenly found herself floating upwards.
Looking to her side, she saw a dog also floating in the air. And suddenly she
found herself inside this dark enclosed room. She had some trouble seeing at
this point, but she did feel as though an instrument of some kind was being placed on her head. This made her
somewhat uncomfortable and aggravated, as she put it. She did sense the presence of two figures around her, but
could not clearly see them. She did have the impression that they were talking to each other in a language she could not
understand. The next thing she knew, she was back on the patio of her home, and it was four or 5 hours later. So
certainly an interesting although brief onboard experience. And in an apparently
unrelated case 10 months earlier, also in Phoenix, a young witness reported
seeing a silver white disc, 45 feet wide, 35 ft tall, sitting on the ground
not far from his home. Standing next to the craft was a quote very tall, lean
male. And as the witness says, he appeared to be 7 feet tall, wearing a
silver gray military type uniform. He said, "Return to your home. Do not come
back until morning." He communicated with his mind. He was firm in his request and compelling, but did not
present himself as threatening. I returned to my home. I could hear sirens coming to the location where the saucer
and the man stood. 2 to three hours later, the police did come to our door
and asked my mother to keep all of us indoors that night. So, another really
interesting humanoid case in Phoenix. Apparently not related, but who knows?
It was just 10 months earlier. How about that? Interesting that she saw a dog floating in the air. I did a whole
episode on dogs that have been taken on board UFOs. She didn't see the dog on
board, but I wonder about it. her memory of the actual onboard segment is
somewhat shady. She doesn't really remember all of it. I mean, so it's very
possible that there's more to it than she consciously recalls. But another
example of someone who's been taken on board these craft. So many of them. And
here's another one. This one was published in various newspapers, but
hasn't gotten a whole lot of attention. I call this one the onboard UFO encounter of Francesco
O'Hada. So, this one is super interesting because this appears to be a sort of
opportunistic event. And by that I mean it doesn't appear that the ETSs were
specifically seeking out this boy. He kind of just walked up to a landed craft
in the forest and this resulted in an onboard encounter or so it would appear.
This one occurred on March 3rd, 1976 in Fontala. This is in Sierra,
Brazil. And it's a pretty amazing case with some fairly significant
physiological effects. This case was first published in the Brazilian newspaper Lassion and later in an
article by Gray Barker in the June 1977 issue of the Saga UFO report and was
later widely published in several UFO publications. It's sparse on details,
but apparently on March 3rd, 1976, 12-year-old Francesco Oha
disappeared. He was last seen leaving his school in Fort Tallesa. When he
didn't return home that evening, his frantic parents organized a search. And
this search continued the day after and the next day with no trace of Francesco
being found. Finally, after two days, his parents, guided by Francesco's dog,
found him in the forest about one mile from his house. He was crying. He was
disoriented. He was wandering aimlessly. He was unable to see and his skin was
red as though from a bad sunburn. So, they rushed him home and he had an amazing story to tell. Around 400 p.m.,
12-year-old Francesco left his school for the day and was walking through the woods to his home in Fortza, Brazil.
This was a trip he had taken many times before, of course. But coming to a clearing in the woods, he was amazed to
see a shiny metallic discshaped object resting upon a kind of metal platform.
He said a door was open to the craft. He estimated that it was about 40 ft in diameter. But most amazing, standing
next to it were two humanoids under 5t tall wearing shiny suits. Francisco had
the impression that they were making some kind of repairs to the craft. Now seeing the boy, the beings were
apparently startled as they immediately leapt into the craft through the open door. The door promptly closed. A device
located on top of the craft started to rotate. It then flashed an intense beam of light onto Francesco, blinding him,
causing him to fall to the ground semic-conscious, he said. And the next thing he knew, he was waking up inside
the craft. He had some trouble remaining fully awake, but he does recall that the beings removed his clothes, placed him
on a table. He said, "A very bright amber light shone down on him, and they
began to communicate telepathically, as he says, in my head." And they began to
assure him that they intended him no harm. They then told him, quote, "We are
coming in great numbers to visit your planet." The next thing he knew, he was back in the forest. His skin was
sunburned. He was unable to see. Thankfully, by morning, his sight had returned. But per the Lassion newspaper,
turned out residents of the nearby villages were very concerned, as over the last few nights, an unidentified
flying object had been seen by many of them crossing the skies and sending down brilliant beams of light. Pretty darn
interesting. And as often happens when people are taken on board, they are
physically examined. According to Thomas Bullard, who did the first statistical study of on board UFO cases, that is the
one event most people report. And in fact, I would say the vast majority of
people who are taken on board are physically examined. And for that reason, we conclude that this is one of
the reasons people are taken on board. And I've come to learn that a lot of the times this is really all about healing.
As you may know, I wrote a book about healing cases, the healing power of
UFOs, outlining some 300 cases. It's practically double that now. I keep
uncovering new cases. But I say this because I think really honestly this is
why people are being physically examined. It amounts to a checkup. So
now I want to move to the next case. This one to me is one of the most interesting in this
compilation. This one I call the onboard UFO encounter of Dr. Simon Taylor and
Raza X. This is a multiple witness onboard UFO case. Both these men
remember their experience fully consciously. Both report the same details. But boy, this one is really
unusual. There are some elements to this one that I haven't heard before, at least not in quite this way, but again,
there are other things that sound absolutely sort of run-of-the-mill. Uh because an onboard
experience does follow a fairly set sequence of events. And we see that here. This one occurred on September 16,
1976 in the Elers's mountains of Iran. To me, that makes this case super
interesting because we rarely get information about UFO activity in Iran.
Certainly, we've heard sightings there, but reports of onboard encounters there
are exceedingly rare, but as it turns out, this one occurred at a very
interesting time, bringing quite a bit of confirmation to this event. I think
you'll find it an amazing case. This very unusual case comes from UK researchers Peter Huff and Mo Hullman.
It was the mid 1970s when the witness, the main witness, Dr. Simon Taylor, was
working as an English language instructor in the Imperial Iranian Air Force in Thran. He comes from England,
but was working there. and having some free time on September 16,
1976, he set off with his Iranian friend Raza to the village of Aar located in
the Elers's mountains, also known as the Albor's Mountains. So, they parked their
car in this little village and set off on a hike up the mountain side, finally
stopping for the night in one of the many climbers cabins that are located all along the mountain side. These
cabins are free for anyone to use. And sometime in the middle of the night, Simon woke up to an unbearable heat and
a seeming lack of oxygen in the room. His friend Razo was already up choking
and checking to see if the paraffin lamp, which was lit in the center of the room, might be responsible for this lack
of oxygen. But within moments they heard strange crackling sounds outside
followed by a quote series of heavy pounding thumps. These were beating on
the cabin walls. This was so loud it terrified them both they immediately ran outside still dressed only in their long
johns and t-shirts and were immediately confronted by a shocking sight. There
were three strangelooking figures dressed all in black with their nose and mouth covered and each was holding a
flashlight like instrument. And as Simon says, the only feature I can remember is
their eyes, slightly mongaloid, similar to the Turo men in northeast Iran, but
these eyes were much bigger and more lustrous. It was though the upper part of their face was all eyes.
So their eyes is what really impressed him. He said they were kind of bulging a little bit. And he wondered momentarily
if they were Iranian secret police, but immediately discarded this thought, not
only because of their unusual appearance, that the beings began to speak to both of them telepathically,
saying, "Do not be afraid. Pack your things and follow us." And as Simon
says, not one word was orally spoken the entire time we were with them. It was as
if their words were transferred into my mind, and I heard myself answer just as one can hear one's own thoughts. So
Simon and Raza, to their own surprise, dutifully obeyed and followed these men
out of the cabin down the path for a few hundred feet, when suddenly they were no longer on the path, but inside a strange
room. And I'll just let Simon describe what happens. As he says, "Under our
feet lay a thick Persian carpet. It was as beautiful as any scene, hanging in a
bizaar. The whole place was bathed in the softest of lights. We were in the
middle of what seemed to be an oval-shaped room and were invited to sit cross-legged on the floor. A screen took
up the whole of one long wall. I call it that. Yet, I felt as if we could have
fallen through. We could see the distant lights of the city. The room began to
shake and shudder, and we were told not to be afraid. Although this time I did feel nervous. The lights of Tan began to
recede and then swung back into view directly beneath us. The room was
swaying like a cable car on its way up a mountain. There was a tremendous pressure in my ears, and I must have
looked alarmed because one of the men tried to reassure me, so the men could hardly believe what this window or
screen in front of them showed. The craft apparently was taking them on a visit to numerous places all over planet
Earth. As Simon says, I cannot remember all the places we visited, but I
distinctly remember fantastic aerial panoramas of London, New York, Paris, and my hometown
city of Birmingham. We saw deserts and frozen wastes of ice and snow, seas,
more water than I have ever seen in my life. The pictures were crystal clear and
three-dimensional. When we flew near some sheep on an Albanian hillside, they were so close I felt I could reach out
and touch them. So during this trip around the world, these humanoids spoke to them telepathically, providing a
running commentary about the people in each area, their habits and beliefs. Not
once did anyone or anything, any animal outside the craft react to the presence
of the craft. At one point the beings did say that they live on Earth and
added, "We are not as you see us." Suddenly, with no warning, the trip came
to an abrupt end. The humanoids told them to exit the craft. Again, obeying
the humanoids without question, they stepped outside the room and found themselves suddenly on the pathway.
Looking around them in astonishment, they saw that the sun was now high in the sky, and they were only a couple of
hundred yards from where they had parked the car the day before. They were miles from where they had been taken, was now
hours later, 2:00 p.m., so they were missing about 5 or 6 hours of time. Both
men were disoriented in a days. They drove off in silence, weirdly, not
talking about what had just happened. They drove for about an hour, pulled off at a roadside food stand, and this
seemed to quote break the spell, as Simon put it, and they both immediately began talking in a rush about what had
happened to them. They considered all different theories, everything from a hallucination brought on by fumes from
the lamp, food poisoning, a psychotic break, but the fact that they both
experienced the same thing seemed to negate all these theories. They drove back to Tyran. Both became violently
ill. Simon had crushing migraine headaches, overwhelming fatigue, and
later developed an aversion to bright lights, loud noises. He became somewhat depressed. Both men felt emotionally
shattered. Simon began having many dreams about this encounter. Raza, his
friend, made Simon promise not to talk about it, and soon Raza refused to even discuss the experience. and ultimately
this ended their friendship. Now, interestingly, two days after returning
to Tyran, numerous people all over the city started reporting UFOs. Hundreds of
people were seeing UFOs. And in fact, one event became world famous when the
Iranian Air Force scrambled two F4 Phantom jets to chase an object. This
was captured on radar. This object was showed to be the size of a Boeing 707.
They actually tried to shoot at this craft, but it disabled the weapons control panel and all communication
instruments. So, so many people viewed this and there were other reports of visitations as well. For example,
according to the Thyron Iran Journal, on September 18,
1976, only one day after Simons and Raza's encounter, a gentleman by the
name of Ahmad Bani Ahmad, aged 56, and his wife were visiting Lake Tabri in
Iran, when they had a remarkable encounter. As Ahmad told reporters, my
attention was caught by a glittering body that landed about 100 yards from my car. My wife and I were terrified. The
round object was about four or 5 meters across and there was a small window in the side. Two beings similar in shape to
Egyptian mummies stepped out. So Ahmad says that he was actually taken inside
the craft and that he believed these figures were quote beings from another planet. but he was very reluctant to
report it because he thought he would be disbelieved and ridiculed. So there's no other information on this particular
case. But after the wave of sightings hit the next day, he decided to go
public and share his experience. But back to Dr. Simon Taylor and Raza. Simon
says he was never able to fully understand his encounter, but he later shared it with an expert in Iranian
theology who told him that his encounter could likely be explained as the trickster spirits known in their culture
as gins. So this theory resonated with Simon, but he wondered about it because
as he says, the entities, whatever their true identity, were real. Of this I have
no doubt. They could touch and be touched. see and be seen, speak and be
spoken to. We were not dreaming. Simon, like many contactes, would later have
quite a few psychic experiences, including a bizarre phone call from an unknown person saying, "Raza has joined
Raza." Remember, Raza is his friend. And shortly later, he learned that his friend Raza had actually passed away.
So, that was unusual. He also continually had the feeling that these beings were still with him, watching
him. And as he says, I know they are there on what I call the tip of my memory. They move around ghostlike at
the back of my mind. I know they are there, but not what they are. So
interesting. And the witnesses themselves are struggling to interpret
this experience, raising all kinds of theories. I think this shows the sincerity of the witness. They're not
immediately jumping to, you know, this is UFOs and extraterrestrials. They're really trying to figure it out. I think
one of the most puzzling aspects of that particular encounter is the fact that when they went on board, there was a
Persian carpet on the floor. Now, this may sound unusual, but I have to tell
you, I've investigated other cases with similar details. This is how advanced
the ETSs are. they can create an environment that will make the witness
feel perhaps a little bit more comfortable and simulate an environment that they're familiar with. So, this is
I think probably what's going on here. I can't say for sure. This isn't my
experience. So, I absolutely have to respect each witness's interpretation of what happened to them because after all,
it is their experience. I personally think it probably was extraterrestrial
given that there was so much UFO activity going on at the same time that these two men had their apparent onboard
UFO encounter. All right, let's move to the last and final case of this compilation,
which is also super interesting and just a little bit different. I like to present these cases with unique details
because I think they answer some of the questions and provide additional
information as to what's going on here. So, I call this one the onboard UFO
encounter of Tatiana Miko Leona. May have butchered her name there a little
bit, but I did my best. At any rate, this case took place on September 13,
1989 in the Pratino area of Russia. This is a super interesting case, fully
consciously remembered. Uh, and also pretty benevolent, although the witness did
experience some fear. It's a really amazing case because like many people,
she was essentially given a ride on board this craft. Not sure why the ETSs
are doing this other than to just announce their presence and get people used to the idea that we are not alone
in this universe. You can make up your own minds about it, but man, this is an
interesting case. This case comes from researcher Vladimir Azaza of the UFO lab
Russia UFO group and was published in the publication Moscowskaya Pravda. It
was around 900 p.m. on September 13, 1989 as the witness Tatiana Mika Lavona.
She's a 40-year-old married mother of two children. She was walking near her home located in Pravinino. This is not
far from Moscow, Russia. She had just gone shopping, was carrying her groceries. Suddenly, two 6-ft tall women
came out from behind a group of nearby boulders and walked right up to her. She was immediately concerned because there
was a strange sluggishness kind of lethargy that came over her, which made it very difficult for her to move. While
at the same time, she was also frightened by these beings very unusual appearance. They had light blonde hair,
grayish greenish skin, and wore small silver caps with what looked like two
antenna-like protrusions on top, and were wearing tight-fitting silver suits.
They spoke to her audibly in perfect Russian, but with a strange, squeaky voice, and they invited her to go with
them. Now despite her fear, Tatiana found herself following these two strangers along the road for about 300
ft where there was an electrical transformer station. Sitting on the corner right there was a small
discshaped object about 12 ft wide and 8 ft tall. A door opened on the side and
two woman led Tatiana inside. The interior of the craft was completely
metallic except for one large transparent window. She saw what looked like an instrument panel lining the
circumference of the room. There were three armchairs. In one of them, a man
sat with his back to Tatiana. She could see that he had wide shoulders and strong arms, but during the entire
encounter, he never moved or turned around. One of the figures who had invited Tatiana in on board said, quote,
"Fly with us." Tatiana declined politely, explaining that she had many chores to do, including teaching her son
his school lessons and preparing dinner. And this is when one of the women told her, "Well, if you hurry, the flight
will be over in a short time. Do you agree?" So this time, Tatiana gave her
consent. Still holding her grocery bag, she decided to offer some of the bread she had just purchased to these beings.
and they told her that they do not quote eat your bread and then offered her a
piece of their own bread. One of the ladies reached out and handed a small piece of this bread to Tatiana and
without thinking about it, she immediately took the bread and put it in her mouth and ate it. She said it tasted
to her kind of like wheat or rye bread, but was much sweeter. Tatiana then sat
down in one of the armchairs, and immediately this craft took off silently. A light on the ceiling of the
room began to revolve rapidly and looking out this window, Tatiana could
now see the rooftops of the city as they flew over this area. She said the flight was very smooth, very calm, and after
about 10 minutes of this, Tatiana asked if they could return her back home. One
of the ET woman asked her, "Where do you live?" Tatana replied, "In one of the
prefabricated buildings in the outskirts of Prodino." They asked her, "On what floor?" She
replied, "The 14th floor." At this point, they offered to drop her off on her balcony. Tatiana considered this,
but thinking of her husband and children and that they might be frightened by this, she declined this offer and asked
them to drop her off in a parking lot near her home, which they did. The ETSs said goodbye and told her that they
would contact her again someday. Tatiana was not happy to hear this. This
encounter, although benevolent, was quite frightening to her. She quickly left without saying goodbye. Researchers
did later learn that another resident of Pratvino saw a discshaped craft lifting
up off the ground around the same time as Tatiana's experience. How cool is
that? They actually offered to drop her off on her balcony. Me personally, I probably would have said yes in hopes
that my family would see it, but I can understand why she declined and asked them to drop her off uh in a place where
her family wouldn't see all this. She was thinking of her family. That's I think totally
understandable. And I understand that this was frightening for her. Even though I think you can agree the ETSs
were absolutely benevolent. There's no sign of them wanting to hurt
people in any of these cases, I don't think. Uh, again, I'm just reporting the
facts. It's up to each of us to make up our own minds about it. I do try to present cases that I think are valid and
have information that can help us understand what's going on here. I also find it very interesting that in pretty
much the vast majority of cases, the ETSs are saying the same things. Do not
be afraid. Have no fear. No harm will come to you. You're fine. Relax. Calm
down. So, I think this is significant. And I think these cases are
really important. I think all UFO cases are important and interesting, but these
onboard cases, they have so much more information than almost all the other
cases. That alone makes them worthy of study and interest. I think and I hope
that one day this does go mainstream. It's true our congressional officials
and governments are admitting to the validity of this subject, talking about
UFO sightings, even crash retrievalss and bodies being held in hangers or what
have you, but they're not really talking about the fact that people are having direct contact. And I think that glaring
absence is absolutely telling and shows that this coverup is still fully in
place. This is one of the reasons I really like talking about cases of direct contact, humanoids, and onboard
experiences because people deserve to know the truth. And this is the biggest
part of the UFO phenomena. Like I said, it's the cutting edge. So yeah, that's
why I think these cases are important. So that's it for today. Hope you found
this episode interesting, perhaps learned something. It's clear to me this
is really going on. There are far too many cases to explain away as our governments would like to say as hoaxes,
hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. No way does that account for the
implants and the physiological effects and the multiple witness cases and the landing traces and the fact that some of
these objects are being caught on radar and photographed and so forth. So yeah,
clearly something is going on here. Any logical person can see that. So thank
you again. I truly appreciate it you guys. It's because of you I'm doing this research. So thank you. Thank you. Thank
you. And until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for
the truth. It's up to you. And most of all, keep having fun. I will see you
next time. Bye for now.
