Many skeptics have a hard time accepting the reality of humanoid encounters. Imagine how difficult 
it must be for those who have this kind of experience themselves. A humanoid encounter causes an 
instant shift in a person’s worldview, forcing them to re-evaluate everything they thought they 
knew about the universe we live in. The problem is, countless cases like these come from all over 
the world. This video presents a dozen cases of face-to-face encounters with different types of 
humanoids, providing a glimpse into what it’s like to have this kind of experience.

AN ALIEN ARTIFACT. On Aug 14, 1965, Joao do Rio was fishing in the Paraiba River in Cruzeiro, Sao 
Paolo, Brazil when a disc-shaped craft landed nearby. A small humanoid emerged and spoke with him, 
asking Joao to tell the world about the ETs. Joao said nobody would believe him. The ET gave him a 
piece of metal. Sadly, this led to big problems for the witness.

THEY WANT ME. Tyler was just a kid when one night in Jun 1966, he stepped out of his home in 
Scotch Plains, New Jersey. A UFO appeared and looking down at him were three humanoids. He ran 
inside and told his family. They came outside, but the craft was gone. The next day, the military 
showed up at his home and threatened him not to talk.

THREE GLOWING HUMANOIDS. At 2:30 am, on Dec 14, 1972, a man was driving near his home in Lauhala, 
Finland when he saw three glowing beings cross the road. He fled the area but returned with his 
friend. Both men saw the short glowing humanoids move into the forest. Unknown to them, a man 
just a few miles away saw a UFO around the same time.

THE ALIEN ON HAMPTON BEACH. After midnight on May 20, 1974, a young man decided to swim at Hampton 
Beach off the coast of New Hampshire. A saucer showed up and landed on the beach. To his Shock, a 
tall humanoid wearing a bulky suit stepped out and surveyed the beach. The being quickly returned 
and the craft departed, leaving behind strange landing traces.

A GRAY TOOK ME AWAY. One afternoon in May 1975, four siblings were playing outside their home in 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma when a silver UFO appeared overhead. They felt like it was watching them, 
so they fled inside. That evening, two of the sisters who shared a room were shocked when a gray 
alien appeared, taking one of the sisters from her room.

IT HAD NO FACE. On the night of Jan 11, 1976, 14-year-old Bobby F. was walking to a friend’s house 
in Hamden, Connecticut when he saw a glowing humanoid floating above a field. He ran to his friend’s 
house. He returned with two others, and all three saw the creature. One of the kids shone a 
flashlight at it, which made the creature flee. But it soon returned, until the other kid pulled 
out his shotgun and fired.

THE LEAPING ALIEN. At 5:30 pm on Oct 15, 1977, a mother and daughter drove along a country road 
in Midland, Michigan when, without warning, a humanoid leaped 30 feet out of the woods, landing 
in the middle of the road in front of them. They slammed on the brakes and watched as the creature 
leaped another 30 feet into the woods on the left side of the road, leaving both witnesses stunned 
with disbelief.

A THIRSTY UFO. At 6pm on Mar 23, 1978, a man walked along a beach near Sao Paolo, Brazil when a 
silver craft zoomed towards him and hovered just above the water offshore. Two short humanoids 
emerged, stood on top of the craft and used a hose-like device to suck up the water. After ten 
minutes, the UFO dove into the water, leaving behind a shocked and frightened witness.

HUMANOID ENCOUNTER ON RIVER STYX RD. On the night of May 1982, two men drove along a country road 
in Chatham, Ohio when a glowing object appeared high in the sky. Then it zoomed closer, showing 
itself to be a metallic craft with windows. Inside, they could see three aliens looking at them. 
The craft darted off and they drove home, only to realize they were missing 30 minutes of time.

IT WAS COMFORTING ME. One night in Jul 1994, a young girl woke up in her home in Verona, Wisconsin 
to see a strange figure looking in the window. It glowed with white-gold light, and had a bald 
head, small dark eyes and four fingers on each hand. She had the feeling it was there to protect 
her. The encounter started the witness on a lifelong search for answers.

I FELT INEXPLICABLY HAPPY. One night in Fall 2011, a young woman woke up in her home in Alabama 
to see a gray alien looking down at her. Instead of fear, she felt a strange sense of amusement 
and surprised herself by laughing uncontrollably. The gray alien disappeared. That week she made 
a pivotal decision about the direction of her life.

I WAS IN COMPLETE DISBELIEF. One night in July 2019, a Reiki Healer was shocked when a gray alien 
appeared in her bedroom. She was unable to move and was initially terrified. But as the alien 
examined her with curiosity, her fear evaporated. After the encounter, she was affected 
physically, mentally and emotionally.

Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennit and welcome to a new episode of "UFOs in the 
Paranormal". Thank you very much for joining me tonight. I truly appreciate it and hope you're 
doing very well. I, of course, am continuing my ongoing mission to explore strange new humanoids. 
I think the humanoid cases are really important. There's so much we can learn from them. They're 
so interesting. And I have got 12 cases that I'm almost sure that you have not heard before. 
It's kind of the purpose of this episode is to just show how many cases there are. These cases 
do come from all over the world, all different types of ETs, all different types of evidence, 
some multiple witness cases. 

And today's episode is called, "I was in complete disbelief; 12 firsthand face-to-face encounters 
with aliens". These cases come from all over the world. Including two cases from Brazil, one from 
Finland, and nine from the United States. Including Alabama, Connecticut, Michigan, New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin. These cases reach all the way back to 1965 up to 
the current century. And I think you'll find that these cases show just how truly profoundly an 
encounter can affect a person not only physically but emotionally, spiritually, psychically, and 
really change the course of their life. So, let's just get started. 

And the first case I'd like to talk about today is not well known. I call this one "an alien artifact". 
It occurred on August 14, 1965 in Crusero, Brazil. This one is super interesting to me because I 
think it shows one of the goals of ETSs is basically trying to announce their presence. It also shows 
how difficult it can be when a person gets hold of an ET artifact. This case was first published in 
the issue number 54 of the Brazilian publication SBEDV. They heard of the case when it was published 
in the Journal Do Brazil newspaper. And it also appeared in other newspapers and later in Charles 
Bowen's book, "The Humanoids". Actually in several other books. The witness is Xiao Doo Rio. His 
actual name is Xiao de Olivera. He's a factory railway stock room worker for the Fabrica Nanal 
Devagos. This is located in Crusero in Sao Paulo, Brazil. According to the researchers of this case, 
Xiao has a very good reputation in the area and is considered by those who know him to be a quote "an 
honest, simple, and hardworking man". 

It was on August 7, 1965 that Ziao was fishing along the nearby river Pariba. As he was fishing, he 
felt a sudden cold wind behind him. And turning around, he saw a disc-shaped craft landing nearby. 
And from it emerged a small humanoid or a little man, he said, which he described only as being about 
70 cmters in height. That's just over two feet. And having large luminous eyes. Now, this humanoid 
approached Xiao and spoke to him in his native language of Portuguese, speaking very clearly and 
saying that he was a crew member from the disc-shaped craft. And that he was from another world. 
This humanoid then instructed Xiao to tell everyone about the encounter. Xiao argued with this 
humanoid, saying that nobody would believe him and that he would be ridiculed. Now, it was at this 
point that the humanoid handed Xiao a small fragment of metal and told him that this metal did not 
exist on Earth. So, this was apparently proof for the witness. 

The figure then returned to the craft which promptly took off. Xiao obediently fulfilled the UFO occupants 
request and shared his story publicly and actually handed over this alleged piece of metal to the 
laboratories of the factory where he worked. Now, according to the researchers from the SBEEDV bulletin, 
they learned that in the days that followed, Brazilian Air Force officers showed up and interviewed Xiao 
personally. They apparently showed a great interest in the case. Four days later, this is interesting. 
Another newspaper printed up a follow-up story saying that Xiao had actually retracted his story and 
that this alleged 
piece of metal was in fact just an ordinary stone which his mother-in-law found besides some banana 
trees. Now, according to the SBEDV investigators, they write that Xiao quote has been intensely 
intimidated after having spoken publicly about his contact experience. Furthermore, the whereabouts 
of this metal fragment and any information about its alleged analysis are missing. So, we don't 
know what became of it. This was just a stone. Why can't we see it? Also in support of Xiao's story 
is that several people working in a workshop near the factory report that for three days in a row, 
this was during the time of Xiao's encounter, they observed a glowing object hovering not far from 
this same factory. According to these witnesses, this object appeared at 300 p.m. on each occasion 
and remained in view for a full 15 minutes before departing. So that's pretty good confirmation. 

Clearly, there's some controversy surrounding that case. According to the investigators, 
it looks like this guy was actually threatened and forced to recant his story. Hard to say for sure, 
of course, but I also find it interesting that there were sightings in that area at that time, 
which I think certainly lends an extra level of credibility to his case. And there's always 
another case. You can disregard one case or 10 or 20, but like I've said many times, 
there's always another case to take its place. 

And here's the next case I'd like to talk about, which I call, "They Want Me". This one occurred one 
evening in June of 1966 in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. This is a single witness case that apparently 
involves missing time and also apparently involves some government involvement. With this case, it 
took the witness a full 50 years to report what happened to him. a UFO encounter involving humanoids, 
missing time, and what appears to be a subsequent intimidating visit by government officials, and a 
psychic aftermath that really changed his life forever. I call him Tyler. That's a pseudonym. He is 
anonymous. He was just a young kid. Was about 6:30 p.m. one evening around June in 1966. There was 
still daylight outside. It was Tyler's turn to take out the garbage after dinner. They had just had 
dinner in their home in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. So, he grabbed the garbage and was walking to the 
side of the house. 

And this is when his life changed forever. I'll just quote Tyler directly. As he says, 
"I hear a static crackling noise and see and feel my hairs standing up. I look up and see a large 
craft, modern, long, dull, and shiny with a big front window. It's crackling, a weird vibration, 
humming. And there are three figures looking at me, pointing at me. I am scared, stiff, 
unable to move. I know that they have come for me. They are pointing at me. They want me". So Tyler, 
now frightened, ran back into the house screaming, "I saw a UFO." At first, everybody in his family 
laughed at him, but seeing that he was serious and insistent, they finally went outside. Tyler 
was shocked to see that it was now dark outside. It had been light when he first saw this UFO, 
so apparently there was missing time. And of course, now the UFO was gone. 

Tyler was still upset and insisted that his father call the police to report the incident, which his 
father did. And to their surprise, they found out that other people in the area had also called into the 
station to report strange lights hovering over the nearby Wong Mountains. It was later that night the 
phone rang and his father answered it. A person on the other line informed Tyler's father that they 
would be receiving a visit tomorrow to discuss this sighting that they wanted to speak with 
Tyler directly. He had school the next day, so he was told to stay home. Tyler's father also stayed 
home from work. Tyler's brothers and siblings went to school, so it was just Tyler, his father, 
and his mother. Presently, a dark blue Air Force vehicle showed up at the house. It had numbers 
on the door. It looked quite official. 

Two men got out and came into the house and interviewed Tyler alone about what he had seen. The men 
then talked privately with his parents. And finally, they talked to Tyler and his parents together. 
And as Tyler says, they tell us not to talk to 
anyone about this, that my life will be ruined if I report a UFO. kids will tease me unmercifully 
for the rest of my life and that what I saw was a weather balloon from the Air Force and 
not to talk about it anymore. So that sounds like a threat to me. The aftermath of the incident was 
also quite traumatic because for years after Tyer said he was afraid to be outside alone in the dark 
and he began having quote strange dreams of freef flying around and seeing my house out of body type 
experiences, the sensation of falling or dropping in my sleep. So these are all red flags that this 
was an onboard encounter. And given that there was a missing time, I think there was more to this 
encounter than he remembers. At any rate, Tyler grew up, moved to Tampa, and then to Honduras. But 
even today, decades later, he says he continues to have strange dreams about this incident. And not 
only that, now his son is also reporting strange experiences. That case is truly fascinating to me. 
I've said it before, one person's simple sighting is another person's close-up encounter 
with humanoids, and in this case, a missing time encounter. It's pretty clear what happened here. 
It's also not the first case I've heard about. There are many like it where people receive a 
visit from government officials following their encounter. This I think is significant because it 
just goes to show that explaining away encounters as the government does as a result of hoaxes, 
hallucinations, misperceptions, and mental illness is completely disingenuous. They're clearly taking 
this encounter quite seriously and many others like it. Such a shame the way this subject has 
been mishandled because the world would be a very different place. Now, let's move to the next case, 
which is equally fascinating. This one's outside of the United States. I call this one three 
glowing humanoids. This occurred on December 14, 1972 in the very small town of Loala, Finland. To 
me, this is an interesting case because there are multiple witnesses and very unusual humanoids, and 
it's quite a long case in terms of how long this sighting went on. This multiple witness case comes 
from author and UFO researcher Hiki Vertaninan of the Finland UFO Research Organization. It was 
2:30 a.m. as Viko Kivioa, a farmer, was returning to his home in Laala village in Honka, this is 
in Finland. He had just visited his neighbor Sepo Oja. He had driven about one mile along a winding 
forest road, a remote area, and coming around a corner. This is when he noticed what looked 
like three bright lights on the left side of the road. Thinking it was another car, he came to a 
stop. The lights were now a little closer, and Viko could now see that these little lights were 
actually three humanoid figures glowing intensely with white light. They were heading across the 
road in front of him towards a clearing on the side of the road that had been recently cleared 
by logging. Now, Viko was close enough to get a pretty good look at these figures. He said that 
they had round heads, but that their facial features were not visible. He could see what 
he described as wing-like arms resting on their hips. He said they had legs and walked softly and 
easily. really astonished at what he was seeing, he decided to return to his friend Sepo's home 
and get him to witness the strange beings. Also, to turn around, he had to drive slightly ahead, 
and as he turned, his headlights shone directly on the creatures. Strangely, they seemed to pay 
no attention to him whatsoever. He could hear no sound coming from them at all. So, he turned 
around, drove up to his friend's house, and honked the car horn. His friend Sepo woke up and Viko 
quickly told him about the strange creatures. Now his friend was initially skeptical but could see 
that his Viko was very serious. So he agreed to follow and they soon reached the spot where he had 
seen these humanoids and both men were amazed to see that these strange creatures were still there. 
By this point they had left the road and were now walking towards a small hill about 100 meters 
away. But both men could see that these figures were surrounded by this bright glowing light, 
bright enough to illuminate the trees around them. And they watched them for about 10 minutes, at 
which point the glow faded away. The men then went outside to check for evidence, but were unable to 
find anything unusual. However, events weren't over yet because it was just about 5 hours later 
that a dairy worker by the name of Himo Matila was driving his tractor on another road about 
10 kilometers away from where Viko and Sepo had seen the humanoids. It's about 6 milesi. Suddenly, 
the man saw a very bright light coming from the right side of the road about 100 meters away. And 
as he got close, he saw that it was a bright green object about 2 m 6 feet in diameter and flying 
about 3 feet or 1 meter above the ground. Says it was moving very slowly at almost a walking pace, 
but was easily evading all the obstacles in its way. So it was clearly controlled. Now, realizing 
that this glowing object was going to reach the road right about the same time he was, the witness 
drove his tractor faster, as fast as he could, and he managed to pass the object just before 
it flew over the road behind him. And looking in his mirror, he could see the object cross the road 
and go off into the trees. I'm always very curious what these alleged ETs or humanoids are doing in 
these locations at that time. hard to say. There's apparently not a whole lot going on in terms of 
technology in this area. So, we don't know. But what's fascinating to me about this case is that 
there was initially a single witness and he did the right thing. He quickly got another witness 
who confirmed his story and unknown to either of them, there was a third witness. When you have 
this many witnesses, it's hard to discredit a case as a result of perhaps a hoax or hallucination or 
misperception or anything like that. There are so many cases like these going on all over the 
world. And here's another one. This one is also really not at all well known. I call this one the 
alien on Hampton Beach. This occurred on May 20, 1974 on Hampton Beach in New Hampshire. This is a 
single witness case and there is some controversy surrounding it, but it's super interesting because 
this does involve a landing, a humanoid, apparent landing traces, and a quite unusual humanoid as 
well. This case comes from researcher John Paul Oswald who was a researcher not only for the 
Mutual UFO Network but also for the National Investigative Committee of Aerial Phenomenon. 
And he calls it quote an interesting report of a midnight landing of a UFO with an occupant seen to 
eress from the craft. The witness is anonymous and known only as Mr. P. He's 32 years old. And 
the researcher John Oswald describes him as quote a good worker, cheerful, likable, and a serious 
Christian, but also quote simple-minded. It was midnight on May 20, 1974, and Mr. P decided to go 
swimming at Hampton Beach. This is just north of the spot where the Hampton River flows into the 
Atlantic Ocean. This is again in New Hampshire. And while there, Mr. P not noticed a disshaped 
object flying in a horizontal path over the ocean, quickly arrived at the beach, stopped and hovered, 
and then descended vertically onto the beach. The landing spot was just below the tide line at low 
tide, so right there at the edge of the water. He said it had lights on it and four landing legs 
with what looked like pads on the end. He was close enough to it to hear a quote pulsing hum 
combined with sort of an electrical motor sound coming from the craft. He was also close enough 
that he could actually feel heat emanating from this craft. So he was some distance from it when 
at 12:30 a.m. a hinged opening appeared on the underside of the craft. And he says a 6- foot 
tall humanoid emerged. He said it was wearing a bulky looking one-piece jumpsuit. And Mr. P not 
noticed that there were two hoses running from the suit, one emerging near the jawline of the 
being and the other running down the back. This sounds like a breathing device of some kind. The 
figure stepped out onto the sand only briefly and then almost immediately returned inside the craft 
through this opening which immediately closed. The craft then proceeded to lift up vertically 
and then flew horizontally back over the ocean from whence it came. Once it was out of sight, 
Mr. P walked over to where it had landed and using a flashlight saw that there were four marks in the 
sand, apparently from these landing pads and what looked to him like a rosecoled kind of liquidy 
paste inside them. When he went back to the site the next morning, these landing marks had been 
washed away in the high tide. Now, of interest is that at that time, just 1.8 8 miles directly 
to the west of this landing site, a nuclear power station was in the initial stages of construction. 
It is now there. It is known as the Next Era Energy Seabbrook Station. Mr. P did report this 
sighting the very next day to his employer and it was his employer who contacted researcher John 
Paul Oswald. And after interviewing the witness, the researcher was convinced that someone of Mr. 
P's mental facilities was not capable of fabricating such a detailed UFO report. The 
researcher, John Oswald, also learned that Mr. P said that this was his second sighting and that 
he had earlier seen a chalk white UFO land on an isolated beach at Lake Champlain near Burlington, 
Vermont. So, he could be a repeat witness or perhaps a contactee. In defense of his case, 
Mr. P did agree to take a lie detector test. Though this was apparently never done and in 
fact later researcher John Oswald found out that Mr. P's employer did cast some doubt on Mr. P's 
character and reliability when Mr. P confessed to having lied about some missing funds at his place 
of employment. Nevertheless, Oswald says that Mr. P's case quote remains of interest because 
of a small flap that was taking place in this area at that time. In fact, there were six other 
cases between April 8 and June 18 of that same year, including sightings of anomalous lights 
and solid craft and at least one possible landing. All of which adds credibility to Mr. P's report. 
It's the kind of case that is quite frustrating because here we have what looks to be really good 
landing trace evidence, but unfortunately it was not photographed or tested in any way. And yes, 
there's controversy surrounding this particular witness, but given that he did agree to take 
a lie detector test, I think lends some level of credibility to his testimony. And again, this case 
was professionally investigated by an experienced researcher, which I think also raises the bar 
a little bit there. A very interesting case all around. Makes me wonder how many people see these 
things are corroborating witnesses but don't come forward because as we see it often takes 
people quite some time to come forward and share their experiences. Now let's move to the next 
case. This one fits that profile where it takes the witnesses quite some time to come forward. 
Totally understandable in today's hostile climate surrounding this subject. I call this next case 
a gray took me away. This occurred one evening in May of 1975 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This is a 
really interesting case because it starts out with multiple witnesses and a simple sighting. Simple 
sighting often is the precursor to a much closer encounter. And that's what happened in this case, 
which apparently involves missing time. It was a beautiful sunny day as four siblings were hanging 
out in the front yard of their home in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They were just enjoying the 
weather, playing, and talking with each other when they all four noticed, quote, "a grayish 
silver discshaped object in the sky. It was quite high up there, but it was big enough to see that 
it had windows all around the perimeter. And they all thought it was strange because of none of them 
had ever seen anything quite like this. But it was really its odd behavior that left an impression, 
at least on one of the sisters. I'll call her Laya. That's a pseudonym. at the time of the 
encounter. She was in high school. And as Laya says, the strangest thing about the object was 
that every time I would jump from one side to the other, goofing off, as young people sometimes do, 
the object would do the same thing in the sky. Awkward enough, we felt we were being watched. So, 
we went in our house. And that was the end of the sighting. And as the evening arrived, the UFO 
sighting had been pretty much forgotten. and Laya and her sister went to bed. They shared the front 
bedroom. They were talking to each other before falling asleep when they suddenly heard what 
sounded to them like horse hooves galloping fast and loud alongside their house and then abruptly 
stopping right at their window. So looking up at the window, they were shocked to see bright 
lights revolving and flashing through their heavy curtains. And as Laya says, we were so scared that 
we covered our heads up with our blanket. The next thing I knew, someone was whispering my name over 
and over until I peeked out from under my blanket. I saw a gray 3-ft tall male being with flaky skin, 
big grayish black eyes, barely taller than my bed, saying my first name through telepathy. 
It sounded like a boy's voice. His head was big, like an egg shape. He had pin holes for a nose and 
mouth. No ears, no genitals. I don't know where he took me. It seems like I saw some others, 
but I don't know. I can't remember right now. I wish I could. He took me away and brought 
me back. Early the next morning, my sister asked me where I was all night, but I was in a daysaze 
and still not sure. So that day was a school day, and they went to school. And that afternoon while 
walking back home to the school bus stop, Laya saw some army men and a couple of other men in 
black suits and a big fancy black car. They were all pulled off at the side of the road and the 
armymen were picking up what looked to Laya like quote purple bones. I don't know what that means, 
but she says they were throwing them in their army truck. Laya stared at the men in black, 
but they stared right back at her and frowned until she stopped watching them. And she says 
the whole encounter affected her profoundly. As Laya says, both my sister and I wondered where I 
was all night. She was in the same bed. We were awake and covered our heads in fear of what was 
happening. I have never been the same. I want to be hypnotized to find out what happened to me. 
A very close encounter. And there's that pattern of a sighting occurring first, followed by a very 
close humanoid encounter. I've said this before, one of the most common places to see a humanoid is 
in your own bedroom, which is really amazing when you think about it and how many cases there must 
be out there, which we never hear about because the witnesses are simply too afraid to come 
forward. So, I'm really glad this witness did. And it does sound like she had missing time. And not 
only is it her saying this, but her own sister apparently verifies this. So that makes this, 
I think, a pretty credible case. And I don't know whether she was taken on board. I suspect she was. 
So it would be very interesting to follow up on these cases. This is one of the problems with 
research. There are there's so much difficulty following up on these cases because witnesses 
are so afraid to come forward. People who come forward are often gaslit. They're ridiculed. 
They're disbelieved. Their own family even kind of pushes back on these cases. So, I totally 
understand why it takes people so long to come forward. Now, let's move to the next case. This 
one is really unusual. I call this one It Had No Face. This one occurred one evening on January 11, 
1976 in a rural area of Ham, Connecticut. This is a multiple witness case. Does involve children. 
Children comprise a pretty large number of UFO and humanoid witnesses for one simple reason. They're 
outside a lot more often than perhaps adults are. They're out there playing, exploring, and this 
is why I think we see so many witnesses who are young children. This case comes from researcher 
James P. Barrett, who was an investigator for the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, 
APRO. It was just before 6 PM January 11, 1976, when 14-year-old Bobby F was walking through 
falling snow on his way to his friend's house in Ham, Connecticut. To his amazement, he saw a large 
glowing figure floating near some sumac bushes about 400 ft away from him. He could really only 
see the figure from the waist up. It appeared to be mostly in profile, but he was close enough to 
notice that it had no discernable face. The back of its head, he said, looked really unusual, 
almost flat and corrugated or grooved. The head of the figure was glowing so brightly that it 
extended about 7 to 8 feet high and 9 ft around and a less luminous silvery outer glow extended 
about 9 ft beyond that. So this amazed Bobby and he ran as fast as he could through the snow to his 
friend's house. He was immediately joined by his two friends, Glenn H, age 13, and Jerry H, age 16. 
Glenn brought a flashlight and Jerry grabbed his 22 rifle. Together, the three boys returned to the 
site and the strange figure was still there. Glenn shown the beam of his flashlight on the figure 
and as he did so, this figure appeared to fall backwards, kind of behind a little ridge there. 
All three agreed that this figure had no visible facial features, no neck, and no apparent arms. 
Glenn then shown the flashlight in another direction and immediately the figure rose up 
again. Glenn shown the light on it again and the figure remained in view of the flashlight beam for 
about three or four seconds and then again ducked behind this ridge. Now when the figure came up for 
a third time, Jerry aimed his rifle and fired two shots over the head. The creature then descended 
for the third time and was no longer seen after that. Now, Jerry told researchers that when he 
shot at this being, he was unable to see it. But apparently, the other two boys were still looking 
at it. That is a very unusual humanoid. But I have to say that reports of glowing humanoids are not 
rare. It's actually quite common. But I wonder about it. What is making them glow? Where is this 
light coming from? If we were to see these guys more close up, would this be a gray? You know, 
a human looking ET? really hard to say for sure cuz all the witnesses saw was this very bright 
glowing entity of some kind. Uh, also interesting is that one of the kids actually tried to shoot 
at this ET. Well, not at it, but above it and that certainly seemed to end the encounter, 
which is no surprise. Now, let's move to the next case. I call this one the leaping alien. This one 
occurred on October 15, 1977 in a rural area of Midland, Michigan. This is a multiple witness 
case. This one again is not well known at all. What's what's to me the most interesting aspect 
of this case is how this ET was moving. Again, this case comes from Walt Andress, co-founder 
and head of the mutual UFO network, MUON. He says he received a letter directly from the witnesses 
describing their very unusual experience with a strange humanoid. The witnesses are Mrs. Foster 
and her daughter Lori. It was around 5:30 p.m. on October 15, 1977. Lori was driving and her mother 
was in the front seat. They had left their home for a shopping trip and we're heading north on 
South Patterson Road and we're approaching this T intersection of East Pine River Road in Midland, 
Michigan. You can see the exact location here. And this is when, without warning, a strange being 
leaped out from the right side of the road, moving in an arc about 4t high and landed smack dab in 
the middle of the road just about 200 feet ahead of them. Lori immediately slammed on the brakes 
and both witnesses could now see that this figure was in fact humanoid in shape. It stood upright, 
was very slender. The head, neck, and torso appeared to be of normal human proportions, 
but were about the size and build of a slender teenage boy. They said it was a smooth dull black 
color from head to foot, and if the figure had any arms, they were not clearly visible to either of 
the women. No sooner had the figure landed in the center of the road when it immediately rebounded 
into the air, and in a second leap disappeared into the underbrush on the left side of the road. 
The way it jumped, they said, was very similar to a kangaroo in the large jumps that it executed. 
They estimated that each leap measured about 30 feet. Now, Lori drove ahead to stop where 
they had seen this land. Both the witnesses then looked around, could see no sign of the humanoid, 
and both were too frightened to get out and look for it. Now, neither of them saw any UFO, but per 
Walt Andress, the previous year, there had been a series of sightings in that area. That case is a 
perfect example of how 60 seconds can change your life forever. These two witnesses saw something 
very briefly, but they're not able to explain it. This appears to be a gray alien. Hard to say for 
sure, but now they have become not only believers, they know. They've had a firsthand encounter. So 
that's experiential knowledge. That is absolute proof to the witnesses. They may not have gotten 
a photograph, but you certainly can't explain that away to them because they were there. That case 
was investigated by Walt Andress, who's one of the founders of MUON, the Mutual UFO Network. So, 
I think it's a very serious case and I think there's so many other cases like this. I really 
wonder what that ET was doing leaping across the road like that. Was there another UFO in the area? 
There very possibly was other witnesses, but again, most witnesses are afraid to come forward. 
This is one of the really difficult things about UFO research, as this cover up has really done a 
number on all humanity. Such a shame. Now, let's move to the next case, which I call a thirsty 
UFO. This one occurred on the evening of March 23rd, 1978 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This is a single 
witness case, but it's super interesting because there are a lot of cases of UFOs that seem to show 
an interest in the water on our planet. And that's what it looks like is happening in this case. It's 
also really interesting how these ETs behaved and the instruments they they were using. There's a 
lot of really bizarre and interesting details in this particular case. This case was published in 
the Brazilian magazine Rista. It was at 6 PM on the evening of March 23rd, 1978, that Xiao 
Anasio Ribero, then age 47, was walking along the beach near Guuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Looking up, 
he saw a 30 foot wide circular craft appear on the horizon. It immediately zoomed forward, stopped, 
and hovered motionless about 250 ft from shore and just above the surface of the water. He said it 
had the appearance of a shiny metallic sphere, was covered with blue, red, green, and lilac colored 
lights. Said there was a dome on top, and three circular windows. Although the object was directly 
above the water, it produced no agitation in the water. Xiao became frightened and this is when he 
saw two three-foot tall humanoids emerge and stand right on top of this object. And as Xiao says, 
the creatures were short, about a meter tall, wearing tight fitting grayish clothing. Besides 
being bald, they had small mouths and noses and protruding eyes disproportionate to the 
size of their faces. One of them carried a kind of stick while the other held a cable and a black 
box resembling a vacuum cleaner. For the next 10 minutes, the crew of this craft repeatedly guided 
the craft over the seawater. Apparently using this instrument to get seawater from the ocean, 
though the witness did not state this explicitly. So after about 10 minutes had elapsed, the figures 
took their equipment and re-entered the craft. The UFO then ascended to about 30 feet above the 
surface of the ocean and promptly plunged into it without producing any turbulence. No foam, 
no waves. Though Xiao says he did hear a hissing sound. Frightened, Xiao fled the scene and shared 
his encounter with his family and was later interviewed by researchers explaining what 
happened. And he told them that he was convinced the craft that he saw was not from this world. 
This case was misreported in some of the accounts which said that there was a lot 
of turbulence in the water, but according to the firsthand eyewitness testimony, no, 
the water was never disturbed at any time. Very hard to say for sure whether that UFO and these 
little ETs were taking ocean water or not, but it certainly looks like it like it. And there's 
so many cases of that actually taking place. So, I suspect that was probably the purpose of this 
encounter. But can you imagine watching something like that for 10 full minutes? It's one thing to 
have a fleeting sighting of an encounter, but when you're that close to a metallic craft and 
the ETSs are balanced there on top of it, I mean, how bizarre is that? That's the sort of 
incident that is just not easily explained away. Now, let's move to the next encounter. I call 
this one humanoid encounter on River Sticks Road. This occurred one evening in May 1982 in Chadam, 
Ohio. This is a multiple witness case, but what's super interesting is the witnesses, 
while they agree on most details, one witness remembers a little bit more than the other, 
there was apparently missing time. The witness to this case reported this encounter about 33 years 
after it occurred. It does involve two witnesses, though only one of them has gone public. I'll call 
him Andrew, but this is of course a pseudonym. Andrew and some family members were visiting his 
friend's farm in Chadam, Ohio. They were having a picnic, and that evening, after cleaning up, they 
headed home. It was around 700 p.m. on a clear night in May 1982. And they were driving southeast 
on River Sticks Road, which you can see here. It's a small country road. Andrew was driving and his 
friend was in the front passenger seat. And it was then that a UFO showed up. As Andrew says, 
we had the sunroof open and we both noticed a real bright light in front of us behind the 
only cloud in the sky. There was supposed to be a full moon or nearfall that night. So, right away 
we thought it was the moon rising from behind the cloud. But then we looked a little to the 
right and there was the moon. So then we thought it was a plane's headlight as it was coming up, 
but then we realized it was hovering. So we thought it was a spotlight from a helicopter. So 
Andrew is describing what J. Allen Highneck, UFO researcher, calls quote theory escalation. This is 
when witnesses go through various explanations to account for their observations, but are forced to 
discard them as it becomes more clear to them that they are observing something truly unusual. Now, 
it was at this point that the witnesses stopped the car. Andrew's friend got out. He walked over 
to the driver's side and together they began to discuss what they were looking at. And this is 
when the object made a real rapid movement. and in literally the blink of an eye was hovering above 
some nearby trees. They discussed whether it was a large object somewhat far away or a smaller object 
up close. Apparently, it was pretty close because Andrew could now discern that this was in fact a 
structured craft. as he says, "I saw a silvery craft that looked like two saucers put together 
at the rims with a gap where the rims join to make room for a row of windows. There were white lights 
and red lights on the top and bottom of the craft. Some were stationary and some lights were moving 
or blinking. I saw entities in the window. I saw three people standing at the windows. They had big 
heads and long arms, but it was not close enough to see details like faces. Then the craft in the 
blink of an eye zipped to the right and hovered for seconds or a minute and then zipped back 
to where it was. Then zipped northeast in the blink of an eye and was gone. So at this point, 
Andrew turned to his friend and said, "Did you see what I saw?" Andrew's friend said, "Yes." 
And they discussed it and they agreed with all the details except one. Later, his friend did not 
recall seeing any humanoids. Now, more weirdness was yet to come. This whole encounter lasted, 
they estimate about 10 to 15 minutes. But when they got home, they learned that they were about 
45 minutes late. So, they were missing at least a half an hour, possibly more. As Andrew says, for 
several days, we could hardly believe it happened. But seeing it together made it real. This was my 
one and only UFO experience. I did not tell anyone for many years. In the mid 1990s, when I did tell 
some people, I was ridiculed and I realized it would adversely affect my credibility. So, I 
hardly told anyone else until now. In fact, it was only after seeing a show about UFOs and hearing 
that the other witnesses were afraid to come forth because of ridicule, Andrew decided that it was 
the right thing to do to come forward. And as he says, what spurred me on was that the show said 
maybe someone else saw something that night. Such a fascinating case. Would really love to 
talk to that other witness given that he had other encounters. I suspect that he may be a contactee. 
It certainly sounds like they were taken on board given that they are missing 45 minutes of time. 
That's a huge red flag. What's also a red flag is that the one of the witnesses has no memory 
of seeing humanoids. When we hear something like that, that is another indication that there's more 
to the encounter than the witnesses can remember. Love to talk to them. I bet they had dreams about 
this encounter and I bet that there's a lot more to unpack about what's going on. It's interesting 
to me that this occurred along the River Sticks Road. I don't know, it's an unusual name for a 
road. Not that there's any connection to UFOs, but I just found it kind of interesting. All right, 
let's move to the next case. Again, quite brief in details, but super interesting. There's a detail 
in this case that really struck me. profoundly. I call this case, it was comforting me. It is a 
quote from the witness. This one occurred one evening in July of 1994 in Verona, Wisconsin. 
And what's to me so interesting about this case is that it was entirely benevolent. This could 
be another case of missing time as well because the witness doesn't remember the entirety of the 
encounter. She was quite young at the time, but a fascinating description of a humanoid. The witness 
in this case was only four or 5 years old when she had her encounter with an apparent humanoid. 
She is anonymous, so I'll call her Rebecca. She's unsure of the exact date, but has pinned it down 
to late July 1994. Her family had left their home in Arkansas to visit their relatives in Verona, 
Wisconsin. They drove all day and arrived at evening time. Rebecca was tired from the trip, 
so she was placed in a papasan chair in the guest room. This chair was about 5 ft away from 
a window, and at some point in the night, Rebecca awoke, as she says, "It seemed very quiet and 
dark. I remember feeling scared at first as I woke up, and when I looked at the window, I saw light 
coming from it. There, right at the window, was an entity with its hands on the window sill staring 
directly at me. As soon as I looked at its face, I immediately felt calm, unafraid, and actually 
curious. It too looked at me. Now, the first thing Rebecca noticed about this being was that it was 
glowing with intensely bright white light, which she described as being like the flash on a camera, 
but a little different. As she says, that's what the light on its body looked like, a white light. 
But also around its body was this golden aura, almost metallic looking. It seemed to tilt its 
head sideways slightly. I remember its eyes were small, black, but it seemed to have a reassuring 
look. I felt like everything was going to be okay. It was like it was comforting me somehow. And then 
after that, I must have lost consciousness. So that's all she remembered except waking up the 
next morning. And it was years later hearing about alien encounters that Rebecca started to do some 
research looking at other people's descriptions of ETSs, but she was unable to find any descriptions 
that matched hers. So it was an experience that left her with more questions than answers. As 
Rebecca says, it was an odd atmosphere in the room for sure. I cannot explain it. From what I 
could tell though, it seemed to observe children as if it was guarding me or protecting me from 
something. That's how I perceive it. To me, the most interesting aspect of that case is how this 
witness felt like this ET was protecting her or guarding her and that it was completely 
benevolent. It's also really interesting that here we have another case of a humanoid that's glowing 
really brightly and apparently not a typical gray, but sounds like a variation of a gray to me. 
doesn't surprise me. The variation among grays is the same sort of thing we see here on our own 
planet with the variation among human beings. So there appears to be a very wide variety of 
humanoids. And in fact, as we go through all of these cases, you can see that it's almost 
as if there's an endless parade of different humanoid types out there. As this next case shows, 
I call this next one, I felt inexplicably happy. This one occurred one evening in autumn of 2011 
in an undisclosed location in Alabama. This is a single witness case, but another example of an ET 
showing up in a person's home. What's to me the most interesting aspect of this case is how the 
witness reacted. At the time of her encounter, Elaine, that is a pseudonym, was living with her 
mother in an unnamed town in Alabama. One evening in the fall of 2011, she fell asleep on the couch 
in the living room. She said it was around 3:30 or 4 a.m. that something startled her awake. I'll 
just quote her directly. As Elaine says, "I looked up and an entity was standing over me. 
He, she, or it appeared to be between five to six feet tall, white skin, and the usual large 
black eyes. The eyes were shiny, deep, and about 3 in across, and angular. The entity was thin with 
a larger head. It appeared to be wearing some sort of stretchy suit, but I was too focused on 
the face to really notice much else. I did notice that the hands were long, as if they had an extra 
joint in each finger with dark colored nails. I never had an experience like that before, 
but I wasn't even remotely afraid. Actually, and I feel like an idiot thinking back on it, I had this 
uncontrollable urge to laugh. I felt inexplicably happy and just laughed. The entity bent down as if 
to observe me. The movement was unusual and fluid in a way. I had the impression of curiosity. Then 
the entity was just gone. Now Elaine explains that this entity didn't disappear. Instead, it looked 
to her more as though it had quote rolled into a different plane. Now Elaine was still laughing. 
And her mother, who was just beginning to get ready for work, heard Elaine laughing and came 
into the room and asked her, "Why are you awake and what is so funny?" Elaine says that she was 
laughing uncontrollably. She was laughing so hard she could only talk gibberish. So her mom 
just assumed that she must be sleeptalking. But Elaine maintains that this was a real experience. 
Now this is interesting because by coincidence or synchronicity this turned out to be a very 
apicious time for her encounter. As Elaine says, I observed an entity in my home and my life hasn't 
been the same since that night and I joined the Air Force that same week. Most people when they 
wake up and they see what appears to be a tall gray alien leaning over and staring at them react 
with fear. It's so interesting to me that this witness reacted in the opposite way with sort 
of this feeling of being inexplicably happy. Some people might say that this was a feeling 
sort of put upon the witness by the ET itself. Hard to say for sure, but we certainly do see 
a lot of cases of people feeling no fear uh and the ET telling them, you know, don't be afraid, 
we won't hurt you, and this sort of thing. But for her to react by laughing is really interesting. I 
also find it super fascinating that that week she joined the Air Force because we do see a number of 
cases of people having a really profound encounter at a pivotal point in their lives. Whether it's 
getting a new job or getting a new home or becoming married or getting separated or going 
through an illness or something along those lines. That is a really interesting and unusual pattern 
that I don't think a lot of people know about, but it absolutely turns up quite a bit. Now, 
let's move to the last and final case in this collection. Also a really fascinating case. I 
call this one I was in complete disbelief. This occurred one evening in July of 2019 
in an undisclosed location in Texas. This is a single witness case, although the lady did have 
a husband sleeping next to her at the time. This is a really unusual case and that the witness not 
only experienced some physiological effects, but it really affected her profoundly in other ways. 
As we'll see, the witness in this case, I call her Anne, that's a pseudonym, she anonymously 
reported her experience of being visited by a gray alien, writing, "It took me many years to be able 
to discuss this occurrence with anyone because I'm extremely well known for being a level-headed 
mentor and healer." She decided to share her encounter for one main reason. And she says, 
"My goal is just to contribute my experience with others that have had the same happen to them." She 
says it was around 9:30 p.m. one evening in July 2019, and she was lying in bed with her husband 
in their home in an undisclosed location in Texas. Her husband was asleep, but Anne was still awake. 
And as she says, "I was lying in bed when my body was completely paralyzed. I could not move, 
but I was wide awake and all I could do was blink my eyes. My hearing became extremely sensitive. 
The window that was beside me had curtains that covered the window from ceiling to the floor, and 
it was as if the wind blew and the curtains moved. I was able to see through the corner of my eyes a 
tall gray being. I was extremely terrified. Being a Reiki master, I started protecting my body and 
projecting positive energy because I was not sure what was about to happen. This thing stood about 
6 and 1/2 to 7 ft tall. It was a gray. I could smell a sulfur kind of smell. It bent over and 
was looking at me while I was protecting myself with Reiki energy. So, unable to turn her head to 
look directly at the being, Anne instead swiveled her eyes to the mirror. and she was now able to 
get a complete view of the gray alien standing beside her in the reflection of the mirror. And 
as Anne says, its body and the arms and legs were extremely thin and long. Its neck was long and its 
head was not proportionally correct to the body. I did not see eyelids on the eyes. The shape of 
the eyes was extremely odd. Did not have a normal nose. It had a mouth, but it did not have lips. 
Now, she did have the distinct impression that this being was studying her in some way. As Anne 
says, "It was as if it was sensing what I was doing. It appeared to be curious. But what was 
extremely odd, this thing gave off an energy as if it was familiar to me." I tried everything 
that I could, every bit of energy, just to move one finger to tap my husband on the forehead for 
him to wake up and look directly at this thing. My dogs were lying on the floor and were whimpering. 
There was a sense of calm that came over me, and instantly my racing thoughts and fears started to 
subside. It did not touch me at all. All it did was bend over and look directly at me and up and 
down my body. It seemed like an eternity that this thing had me in a paralyzed state while it was 
observing me. Right before it left, it brushed up against the curtains, and I could hear the subtle 
sound of the curtain being disturbed. The thing moved the curtain and stepped backwards through 
the window and left. I was able to move my fingers and then my arms, and I woke up my husband telling 
him what had happened. My husband had been in an incredibly deep sleep, which is not normal 
for him. So at this point, Anne looked at the clock and saw that about 7 minutes had elapsed. 
She knew that the experience could not have been a dream because she was never asleep. She 
was fully awake before the incident, throughout the encounter, and afterwards. And in addition, 
there were other effects from the encounter that confirmed the reality of the event. As Anne says, 
both of the dogs had wet themselves. I was in complete disbelief at what just happened. 
The following days after this occurrence, I had sleep issues, aching in my joints, stomach issues, 
and borderline anxiety, and reported her encounter in 2022, about 3 years after it 
occurred. That's a pretty recent case, 2019. It took the witness only three years to come 
forward. So, kudos to the witness for having the courage to step forth and share her encounter. 
Super interesting to me that she is a Reiki master. Seems to be quite a few cases of 
doctors and nurses and healers of all kind being visited. Also interesting is how she felt that the 
presence of this ET was somehow familiar to her or giving off the same sort of energy. I suspect, 
this is just my personal opinion, that it was her abilities to do Raiki healing that may have 
attracted this ET to her because there are so many cases of people who've had encounters then 
suddenly start doing Reiki or hands-on healing or becoming interested in medicine or that kind 
of thing. Well, but it's a concerning case. I mean no doubt this affected her physically 
negatively and also was very difficult for her to process. My heart goes out to all people who 
go through these kinds of experiences because I know having done this research for so many years 
that it can be very scary and very difficult to process an experience like this. So there you go. 
12 cases. I'm pretty sure you haven't heard before. Coming from all over the world of 
all different types of humanoids. Not sure how many cases it's going to take for this subject 
to be fully accepted by all humanity. I don't think we're there yet. Until and 
unless this cover up ends, I think we're going to continue to struggle with fear, 
confusion, skepticism, disbelief, ridicule, and gaslighting. And it's such a shame because 
we know now that our governments do take this subject very seriously. And by our governments, 
I'm talking about the military-industrial complex, the various highest levels of the military, 
the perhaps Illuminati cabal 1enters, call them what you will, the intelligence agencies, 
they know it's real. This is a subject that is of profound importance to all humanity and we all 
deserve to know the truth about it. That's why I am continuing this mission to get this information 
out there because we all deserve to know the truth. That's it for today. Thank you guys so 
much. I truly appreciate you guys watching. Hope you're having a great weekend or week, 
whatever the case may be. Until next time, keep asking those hard questions. Keep searching for 
the truth. Most important of all, keep having fun. I'll see you next time. Bye for now.
