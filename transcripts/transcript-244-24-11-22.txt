WEIRD! WEIRD! WEIRD! TEN TRULY STRANGE UFO ENCOUNTERS
Nov 22, 2024

Summary:
Nov 22, 2024
UFO encounters are known for high strangeness. These eleven close encounters of the second kind all involve cases which affected the environment or the witnesses, in very unusual ways. These cases come from all over the world, and show how truly bizarre a close encounter can be. It appears that high strangeness might be an intentional feature which encourages witnesses to consider new paradigms and explore new ways of thinking.

MAY CAUSE UNCONTROLLABLE MOVEMENTS. Little is known about this case, which occurred on November 10, 1957 to a man from Madison, Ohio. While watching a low altitude UFO, he experienced uncontrollable movement of his hand, which would fly up of its own accord to his face. Afterwards, he suffered from eye irritation.

THE UFO ZONE OF SILENCE. One day in the Summer of 1965, “Susan” and a friend were playing badminton at RAF Chicksands, a satellite communications base in Bedfordshire, UK, when both girls realized they had become completely deaf. Looking up, they saw a low-flying UFO. Others came outside to view it and experienced the total silence. Seven other military bases were visited that day.

KNOCKED DOWN BY A UFO. On the night of November 1, 1966, Mrs. Tibbetts was in her Newfield, New Hampshire home when her son Dale ran inside to report a UFO hovering outside. Looking out the window, Mrs. Tibbetts saw a huge craft just above her rooftop. Seconds later, it struck her with a beam of light, knocking her down and causing persistent eye irritation.

ROCK-DROPPING UFO. On the evening of December 13, 1973, Patrick Thrush (16) was driving to a friend’s home in Bradenton, Florida when he saw what he thought was a plane crashing. Pulling over, he saw it was a silver craft sending down a beam of light into the river. As he snapped two photos, it zoomed at him and dropped three small stones, one of which hit his car.

UFO MAKES WAVES. On the night of March 29, 1974, a couple were on the beach at Lome, in Togo, Africa when a strange craft zoomed in from the ocean. As it hovered above the water, it created a depression on the surface and sent huge waves onto the beach. Then the couple was struck by a hot beam of light from the UFO which paralyzed them. Afterwards, the man experienced vertigo, deafness and fainting.

UFO LANDS AT TOBACCO FARM. On July 6, 1975, tobacco farmer Joe Borda saw silver dome-shaped UFO sitting in the field of his farm in Mount Pleasant, Ontario, Canada. Strangely, he ignored it and forgot about it. But two days later, going to where it had landed, he found a large circle of crushed and burned plants, and two weird oily deposits. Later, strange voices and other high strangeness events would occur.

TRANSFORMED BY A UFO. On the evening of October 1, 1977, Martin Rodriguez was playing with friends near their homes in Tordesillas, Spain when he came upon a landed UFO. Stepping towards it, he was struck by a beam of light. Upon awakening, he suffered from vomiting, dizziness, vision problems, and fainting. He was diagnosed with hydrocephaly, and had many surgeries. He also experienced a mysterious boost in his intelligence.

THE UFO THAT OPENED THE WINDOW. On April 12, 1979, at the tail-end of a UFO wave, a family was driving to their home in Brockton, Massachusetts when a UFO appeared overhead. Suddenly all the windows of their car started opening and closing. The UFO followed them home, continuing its window shenanigans. As the father and son exited the car, both were struck by a beam of light from the craft.

“A UFO SAVED MY LIFE.” As a little girl living on a farm in rural Canton, Ohio, Julie Riggs had a close-up UFO sighting that left her with psychic gifts and a strong connection to the ETs. Later in life, around 1980, she was harassed and then chased in her car by two strangers. As she sped to get away, a UFO appeared and led her off the highway, just in time to avoid hitting an abandoned vehicle on the road.

UFO BEAMS FOUR BOYS. One night in the early 1980s, as four young boys from rural White Horse, Yukon Territory, Canada went for a walk in the woods, they were confronted by a large craft. It moved towards them, hovered overhead, and sent down a beam of light directly in their group. The boys flung themselves to the ground and the craft moved off. The main witness reports that the encounter changed his life forever.

A MINIATURE UFO. One evening in October 2016, a 73-year-old man was walking through a golf course in Worthing, UK when he came upon a shiny silver cylinder about the size of a soda can. He tried to pick it up, but was unable. As he nudged it with his foot, it took off, throwing him back with a strange force. It zipped away, leaving no trace behind.

These high strangeness cases make it clear that there is still much we don’t understand about UFOs and these mysterious visitors to our planet. They do make one thing very clear: we are being visited by something not from this planet.

Nov 22, 2024
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and thank you for joining me for another episode of UFOs and the
Paranormal today I'm not going to be talking about humanoids instead I'm going to be talking about Close
Encounters of the second kind cases that involve the environment being affected
in some way while I do find the humanoid cases the most interesting I can pretty
much guarantee you're going to find these cases interesting as well I call this episode weird weird weird 10 very
strange UFO Encounters this is inspired by one case that I found which really had me
thinking so I dived a little deeper and found a bunch of cases like this these
are important cases I think they have quite a bit to teach us about the ways
UFOs do affect the environment I've chosen cases that date
all the way back to the 1950s up to the 2010s so a good range of time
there I also like choosing cases from across the planet so I've got two from Canada two from the UK one from Togo
Africa and five from the United States including Bradington Florida Brockton
Massachusetts newfields New Hampshire Canton Ohio and finally Madison
Ohio so yeah these are some pry pretty bizarre cases what I like about them is
they do have a lot of evidence so we've got cases involving photographs of
UFOs landing traces uh physiological reactions some
pretty darn severe ones in fact but all kinds of evidence including a couple of
cases with actual ET artifacts that were subjected to Scientific analysis so this
is somewhat rare and definitely super fascinating and I guarantee you this is
going to be a long episode so let's just get started the first case is really
brief this is the one that really inspired me to do this episode because
this case is beyond strange I call this one may cause uncontrollable movements
it's so really brief case not a whole lot of information about it it occurred on November 10 1957
in Madison Ohio and well you you can make up your own minds about it I don't
have a whole lot of information about this case it's quite brief it occurred on November 10 1957 when a man from
Madison Ohio was observing an object he said was Acorn shaped and hovering at
very low level he watched it for a good 20 or 30 minutes and during his
observation he says he experienced uncontrollable movement of his hand
which would fly up of its own accord in front of his face after the craft left
he suffered from eye irritation for two weeks after this event so this is what
got me thinking about strange effects that people have from UFOs I may have
more to say about this case later because I just found another one in the same area on the same night I do wish I
had more information about that case unfort Ely I don't but what a strange
physiological effect that is I don't think I've ever heard anything quite
like that but the cases in this episode they're definitely weird weird weird I
don't know what else to tell you because this next case definitely qualifies for
that description of shout out to Ginger Norman I promised you that there was
another case from bedfordshire England and this is it I call this one the UFO
zone of Silence this is a case which took place sometime in the summer of
1965 thereabouts in bedfordshire England at an RAF Base called
chicksands and this is a really good example of what researchers call the Oz
effect but I don't know that I've ever heard a case quite like this one this
very interesting case involves multiple Witnesses and a very strange effect on the environment the main witness I'll
call her Susan that's a pseudonym she wants to be anonymous at the time of the incident she was a teenager living at
the chick Sands RAF satellite Communications base located in bedfordshire England this is where her
father and her brother were employed One Summer Afternoon she and
her friend were playing badminton on the base just talking and laughing when suddenly they couldn't hear each other
or themselves and although they were still shouting and laughing the entire
environment around them was enveloped in complete silence so this was very
mysterious and looking up this is when they saw a large round dark object about
60 to 80 ft in diameter hovering overhead just above some nearby large
oak trees so Susan's friend ran inside to get her father and once inside
Susan's father was able to hear her but coming back outside to see what the fuss was all about he also experienced this
strange zone of Silence surrounding the UFO he went back inside to alert the
command base at which point this object started to move away and as it did Susan
and the others could now hear that the base siren was going off and in fact the
entire base did go on lockdown according to Susan she later learned on that same
day seven other bases around the world also experienced a sighting so Susan
asked her father about the incidents and all he would tell her was that this object was not our own meaning
extraterrestrial and she was told not to talk about it there are more fascinating details to this case years later still
bothered by the strange incident Susan finally decided to call the National UFO
Reporting Center New fork and now I'd like to play an audio tape of the
witnesses interview that she did with Bob Gribble so you can hear her fascinating story in her own words it's
about 8 minutes long recent incident but it occurred some years ago
in England on a military base let's see it was about
64 or 65 1964 65 okay at Raf chicksands in in
uh bedfordshire England I was a military dependent and the base is a satellite
communication base it was in the afternoon in the
daylight and my friend of mine and I were playing bad Mitten in the backyard
on the base and we were shouting and laughing and carrying on and then we
realized that we couldn't hear each other there wasn't any sound at all and
we stopped and tried to talk to each other again and still couldn't hear each other and looked around and right above
us at the top of the trees they were very old oak trees so they were
maybe 40 50 ft High I guess okay was a
large dark object and um I we couldn't
really tell anything from it because we could only see the bottom and we got scared we were just was 14 15 years old
and uh she went inside the house to get her dad and inside the house he could
hear her and he came out to look at it and we couldn't hear him talking to us either and he couldn't hear us when he
was outside so he went back inside and alerted the post and when he
went back inside it started moving off above the Treetops and as soon as it wasn't right above us we could hear
again and I heard the siren post went on alert
and he came back out and watched it go off over the trees and it was moving very slowly and it moved over maybe I
don't know three or four houses away and they were housing units so it was still
fairly close like I said they were calling the alert and he told me to go home and I lived about 2 blocks away so
I ran home and my father who was a senior NCO on the base was just leaving and every all the
people on alert went down and what we called the hole all the satellite communication stuff was underground and
they went down in the hole and the base was closed to all traffic whether you live there or not they closed the whole
base and he didn't come back until in the morning my father didn't and when he
came back I asked him what it was and he said I can't tell you he said all I can
say is that it wasn't ours and I said you mean ours hours or you mean the Earth hours and he wouldn't say anything
else later some years later when we were talking about it in the family I asked
him again and he said it wasn't ours and I said well I know that and he said well there are
seven bases like the one we were on in in the world seven American bases like
that and he said there were ings at all seven that same day oh boy that's
strange yeah those bases are very small extremely small
there's maybe at the top there's maybe 50 families there plus you know a number
of of non-family people unaccompanied people the everything that's military is
underground except the satellite antenna and it's we called it the
elephant cage it's a great big circular structure and it looks like a big round
circus cage yes and around the outside are these big white things that kind of
look like missiles but they're not missiles it was a closed Post at all times except you know if you had some
reason to go on then the aps the police would let you on and off but um you had
to have some business there it wasn't just open to the public okay what shape
did that object it was round um it was round from the bottom anyway and it was dark okay I'd say you
know dark black or but it was not shiny it was a it was um just a Dusky dark
color was there any estimate of size it didn't seem very large I'm not very good at size and
distances but I'd say I'd say it was maybe 60 to 80 ft cross okay stop that
please I should add the reason I never mentioned this before
was we were told not to talk about it and my father in that line of work
was was in a very sensitive position and it was not uncommon for us to to be told
that things that happened on Bas were not for public consumption yes but it's always bothered me and I know it's
verified because other people saw it and the base went on alert okay and dad said it was
tracked on on their uh equipment yes so
how close would that how close would that have been to you like I said it was right at the top of an old maple tree or
old oak tree rather um but not quite overhead it was overhead first and then
it started moving off slowly and then it um as I was running home I looked back
cuz I was really scared okay and it was moving off very quickly then it just
went zip just but it was before that it was not moving like like an airplane or a
helicopter or anything like that and there was no noise from it okay um but it would move like to the right you know
100 yards and then over a little bit always on a level movement
well I'm glad I finally told somebody okay feels better well if you come up
remember any information uh that you haven't passed on to us we'd like to hear from you thanks very much how
fascinating is that I mean this is a really good example of what UFO researchers call the Oz effect where an
eerie silence envelops the area surrounding a UFO I'm not sure I've heard of any case though where even a
person's own voice is silenced which which makes this an important case and even more significant of course is the
fact that there were multiple sightings at the same time at the various spaces
which makes this case well worthy of attention and as the witness says there were many other witnesses to these
events so hopefully further witnesses will at some point step forward and
there will be more information revealed about these incredible events and as it
turns out chicksands was in fact visited again 23 years later on June 28th 2008 when a
witness at 10:40 p.m. described seeing eight Amber lights high in the sky which
he says were visible for about 10 to 15 minutes then blinking out one after
another now given the description this could be flares very hard to say for
sure but the location is certainly significant so how cool is that to actually hear the witness firsthand
describing her own encounter I always love hearing directly from the witness
it brings an immediacy to the case you can tell she's quite sincere about it
the case really doesn't surprise me a whole lot because there are so many cases of UFOs hovering over military
bases the fact that on that case there was multiple incidents over multiple
bases at the same time that seems very deliberate to me very intentional a
message perhaps being being sent to the military hard to say for sure but it's the kind of case you really can't
ignore now let's move to the next one this is another really good example of
how a UFO can affect the physical environment around us in ways that you
might not expect I call this one knocked down by a UFO it's a pretty interesting
multiple witness case with not only physiological effects but electromagnetic disturbances as as well
this one occurred on November 1st 1966 in newfields New Hampshire here is
another brief account somewhat sparse on details but it was reported on by
respected researchers Donald kho and Gordon lore in the book strange effects
from UFOs on the evening of November 1st 1966 Miss Ray Tibbits who at the time
was receiving Cobalt therapy for a health issue she was talking on the
phone in her home in newfields New Hampshire and this is when her son Dale came running inside to say that there
was a strange light hovering in the sky just outside their home Mrs tibet's
Foster daughter Anita Herrington also joined Dale and both children became
very excited by the appearance of this strange glowing object so this encouraged Miss Tibbits to run to the
window at this point all the lights in the house began to Blink on and off she
immediately went into Dale's room and looked out the window and this is when she saw the object herself she said it
was huge hovering at very low elevation it had two rows of four Windows all of
which were emitting a yellow green light the windows themselves she said were
huge about the size of the wall in her living room and through the lower tier of these windows she could see the
ceiling line of an interior room inside the craft in fact through one of these
windows she could actually see the corner of the room the craft itself was
shiny metallic kind of blue green in color she said and was hovering very
close to the roof of the dining room of their house the object was too large or too close or the lights were too bright
for Mrs tibits to make out any real shape then without warning and intense
beam of white light came out of the object and struck Mrs Tibbits actually knocking her backwards this caused spots
in her vision dazzling her with the brightness of this beam and when her vision cleared the UFO was gone but for
the next two days she says her eyes remained painful extremely sensitive to light she decided to seek treatment at a
medical clinic in exitor New Hampshire and they diagnosed her with spasms in
the eyelid and tearing but they attributed this condition to the Cobalt
therapy she was receiving at that time which is kind of odd because these
symptoms were not happening until she was in fact struck by the beam of light from this
UFO and what's also interesting about this case is that only one year earlier
in late 1965 there was a massive wave of sightings in nearby exiter New Hampshire
only 4 miles away so very close in fact that wave was so intense it inspired a
full length book by John G Fuller called incident at exiter it's an excellent
book I highly recommend it you know when I cover these cases I always get the feeling that the there's a lot more to
each of these that if you were able to dive deep enough and speak to these Witnesses firsthand you could uncover a
lot more information I've said it before but a close encounter like that is rarely a one off wouldn't surprise me
one bit if these Witnesses or some of them had additional
encounters I don't know I wasn't able to talk to them firsthand but I found that to be a particularly fascinating case
because it's one thing to be struck by a UFO beam another to have it knock you down and leave eye irritation and so
forth so now let's move to the next case this is another one I held back from the
UFOs in the hometown episode because it is is just so weird I really wanted to
see if I could find more information about it and I did this one took quite a bit of research this is my favorite case
in this episode it's just so interesting because it is a multiple witness case
there is photographic evidence and there's an actual ET artifact involved
in it as well I call this one rock dropping UFO this one occurred on
December 133 19 73 in Bradenton Florida
so yeah I think you'll find this one really unusual now if you've seen some
of my recent episodes you know that the year of 1973 was a huge year for UFOs often
called the year of the humanoids now this case doesn't involve humanoids but it certainly is an
interesting case it's from Bradenton Florida and this one definitely stands
out from a lot of other cases the main witness is Patrick thrush he was 16
years old at the time at and at 850 on December 13
1973 8:50 in the evening he was driving through Bradenton Florida on his way to
a friend's house he was heading north on 27th Street East and had just about
reached the intersection of Manatee Avenue bordering the Braden River you
can see it here and this is when he looked to his right and saw what he first thought was a plane going down in
the river so he immediately headed down Manatee just a short distance to the
river pulled off the road down an embankment onto the side of the river
and shown his headlights in that direction and in his headlights he saw something amazing of course it wasn't a
plane crashing instead it was a strange silvery craft hovering he said says
about 20 ft above the surface of the water and about 35 ft from the shoreline
the craft was he estimates about 25 to 35 ft in diameter and about 10 or 11 ft
thick this object was hovering in place and here's the weird part coming out
from the bottom of it was a long tube or perhaps a beam it was leading down from
the bottom of the craft at an angle into the water so needless to say Patrick was
stunned by this sight and as he says I just sat there for a second now Patrick
had a camera handy he's a photographic Enthusiast he grabbed his Canon ftq with
a 55 mm lens jumped from his car and quickly snapped two photographs using a
flash bulb now when he did this immediately this tube like thing leading
from the object began to straighten out the object then retracted this tube back
into the underside of the object which now began to descend even lower and
moved directly towards Patrick in fact in seconds it moved directly overhead he
estimates at no higher than 7 ft so he felt and heard something actually hit
the hood of his car apparently ejected from the UFO he didn't actually see it
come from the UFO but he heard it and he describes this noise as quote not quite
a thud but sort of a Clank a metallic noise like someone hitting metal
underneath water now he did also hear splashing noises and as Patrick said
that's about the time I started running in the opposite direction you don't stand around waiting for it to do
something before you figure out what it is so he ran about 50 ft what he
considered was a safe distance then stopped and turned around to watch and he watched this object Veer to
the South First emitting a bluish green light it then changed to a red color and
disappeared off into the distance so Patrick walked back to his car and started searching for what might
have struck his car and he found it easily he found this warm dry Rock
similar in appearance to a lava rock and in fact he quickly found two others they
were very small as he says I managed to find three metallic like Cinders or
rocks on the ground the edges were rounded and it had a Laval likee appearance to it now these rocks did not
damage his car and each was about 34s of an inch in diameter quite thin he
scooped them up and started thinking about what to do next said the total duration of the encounter was no longer
than four or five minutes but meanwhile unknown to Patrick
a gentleman by the name of John dowy age 18 was driving along Morgan Johnson Road
just 2 miles east of Patrick's location and looking up he saw it was apparently
the same craft which he described as a quote bright orange object going really
fast as he watched it turned s South stopped briefly and
disappeared and turns out he's not the only witness to all of this because just
a short away from there and at the same time as these two sightings there was
another witness George Montgomery was in his home at 609 casab Bella Drive also kind of
overlooking the river he looked out a west facing upstairs window and was
amazed to see a strange bright glowing object in the sky he also saw two
smaller lights and he watched as these two smaller lights merged into the larger one and then disappeared
as he says it looked like a star then I saw movement then I noticed another dot
of lesser magnitude up above the first dot also moving in the same direction as the first one I got to staring at it and
then I saw another dot underneath all of a sudden the one above and the one below
converged with the Big Dot now in yet further confirmation of
all of this another gentleman who turned out to be a friend of Patrick was using
his ham radio when at the exact time of Patrick's encounter he lost all
communication on his radio and it only came back online at 920 so this
coincided exactly with the sighting so back to Patrick thrush he
was St stunned by his experience and decided to call the police the trollman
Chris Schmidt was assigned to the case and began an official investigation
the police ended up making no firm conclusions but officer Schmidt did say
that he believed Patrick thrush was making an honest and sincere report of his experience in fact Patrick did offer
to take a lie detector test to prove he was telling the truth though there's no evidence that this was ever
done now Patrick had recently dropped out of high school but not for the
reasons that most students do because Patrick as it turns out was very gifted academically he was
already proficient in algebra trigonometry physics Electronics
photography and More in fact he was the winner of a recent science fair and he dropped out of high school because it
just wasn't challenging enough his father is a metallurgist Patrick himself
at the time was employed by an Electronics research and development
firm so Patrick's Next Step was to to take his undeveloped film to a local
newspaper the St Petersburg times for processing which he did and these photos
as you can see do apparently show an unidentified aerial object sending down
something long and slender into the river two photographs that have yet to
be explained or debunked 10 days following Patrick's encounter the times published the photos
and an article about his case which really thrust it into the Limelight next Patrick submitted one of
these quote UFO rocks to the University of South Florida for
analysis Dr Larry Doyle a geologist agreed to study the Rock and his
preliminary analysis was that this rock had been exposed to an extreme heat
Source it was tested for radioactivity but came out negative and he thought at
first it might be Iron pip pyite but Patrick learned from Dr Doyle that the
Rocks were quote much denser than iron pyite and as Patrick says they do not
have quote the same coloring or glittering effect now researcher Stanton
fredman was able to examine a sample which he said had the appearance of metallic slag Stanton fredman also
talked to Patrick thrush's mother who not only vouched for her son's Integrity
but said that Patrick was visited by three credentialed government agents who
apparently applied pressure on Patrick not to talk about his encounter Patrick did ultimately
conclude that he had seen an extraterrestrial craft presumably from another planet and another solar system
far beyond our own he speculates that the craft he saw navigates by harnessing
the gravitational and magnetic field lines of our own planet and perhaps use
some kind of nuclear Fusion device now Patrick has since dropped out
of the spotlight and this case remains yet another Unsolved Mystery in UFO lore
I think you'll agree that was a pretty amazing case now Patrick thrush was the
only one who had seen this you know I might be a little more skeptical even though he does have photographs but the
fact is this is a multiple witness case and he's a pretty unusual witness too
given that he's remarkably intelligent makes me wonder if perhaps this was an
intentional display that the UFO occupants contacted him or showed
themselves to him on purpose pure speculation but I wonder about it all
right let's now move to the next case which is again super unusual just plain
weird I call this one UFO makes waves it actually did more than that kind of
parted the sea in this weirdly biblical way as you'll see this one occurred on
March 29 1974 in Togo this is a country in Africa
and this is a really super interesting case of what I guess you would technically describe as a
usuo because it affected the ocean in a very unusual way and also the witnesses
as well now this very interesting and truly weird case comes from researcher
Joel manard a French researcher the main witness is known only by his initials aw
he's from France but he had traveled to the small country of Togo Africa for a
vacation while visiting the coastal area of L he met a woman and they spent the
evening of March 28th 1974 swimming along the beautiful beach
this is located just east of the large Tropicana Hotel then located there you can see the area
here it was around 1:45 a.m. when both aw and his new girlfriend heard this
sort of annoying sharp whistling sound coming from the ocean side and turning
to watch they were amazed to see a large dark craft sweeping towards them
hovering right over the water and stopping about 200 to 300 M offshore
pretty close less than a th000 ft and the craft was large about 25 to 30 m
wide 75 to 90 ft again it's dark now so they were up on the beach but the sudden
appearance of this craft had a very weird effect on the ocean actually causing huge waves which came up over
the dry Beach and engulfed them nearly pulling them out to sea aw just managed
to Loop his right arm around a coconut palm and he held his new girlfriend with his left arm and these strong waves came
one after another nearly covering the entire Beach coming right up to the edge
of it after just a few moments of this the object lit up with three bright
spotlights pointing towards them and it looked to him like other lights on the sides and top and these beams of light
were mostly white but seemed to be tinged with other colors including yellow pink and blue green now these
beams of light left both the witnesses unable to move and these beams of light were noticeably hot so hot in fact that
soon both Witnesses found themselves sweating profusely from the heat a detail which left them just a little bit
nervous if not scared now another Super interesting and very weird detail was that looking out
at the ocean surface directly underneath this craft aw saw that the ocean surface
was no longer flat but was kind of scooped out forming a valley or a depression to a depth of about 5 to 6 M
or 15 to 20 ft it was circular in shape and as wide as the body of The Craft
itself so this is kind of like shades of the biblical parting of the Red Sea I don't know but it's certainly weird the
waves were coming out from all sides of the depression now aw's companion who
lived in this area said she had never seen the ocean so agitated and for the
next 20 minutes both Witnesses remained stuck by the beam of light from the UFO
as this craft stayed there finally they felt this coolness sweep over them and
saw that the object was now moving back out to sea but still remaining just above the surface of the water the ocean
immediately returned back to normal aw at this point looked at his watch and saw that it was now 2:05 a.m. so yeah
about 20 minutes the loud whistling sound had ceased but both Witnesses said that they
could still hear it echoing in their heads in a weird way they both returned
to the Tropicana Hotel where aw asked his friend not to speak about it he was
frightened of being labeled crazy and they parted ways but the after effects
from this encounter persisted for quite some time because the next morning upon Awakening aw discovered that he was
almost totally deaf and he felt a strange lightness and emptiness pervading his body this was followed by
excessive sleepiness the next day and he started experiencing several fainting
spells in the days that followed thankfully his hearing did return but he
still continued to suffer from spells of deafness anxiety and shortness of breath
even two years following this encounter just a few months after his encounter he
did see another UFO in Fonville in his home country of France but apparently
that was the end of his encounters there you go I mean that's just another real head scratcher of a case which makes you
wonder what are these UFOs doing why would it hover there for 20 minutes
shining this beam of light on two people and affecting the ocean in that way I
would technically call that a landing Trace though it was on the ocean so
I don't know this not the kind of Landing Trace that you can subject to scientific study but it's absolutely
affecting the environment in a very profound way not to mention the witnesses
themselves now this next case is a really good example of a UFO landing
Trace I get the feeling I covered this one before I seem to remember doing it but I couldn't find it in my files in
terms of having covered this before on this channel so I'm covering it again or
perhaps for the first time I don't know but I definitely found more information it's a amazing case because there is
physical evidence and an apparent alien artifact which was again brought to a scientific lab and subjected to study
that alone puts this case I think on the Forefront of UFO research makes it a
very important case I call this one UFO lands at tobacco farm this occurred on
July 6th 1975 in a rural area of Mount Pleasant this is in Ontario Canada and
it's a super fascinating case not only because of the landing traces but because there were some really
interesting effects with some of the UFO researchers the witness himself I mean
it's an allaround weird case this case is undoubtedly one of Canada's most
famous Landing Trace cases and has had numerous articles published in newspapers and journals and at least one
fulllength book on the case the main witness is Joseph bord he was 48 years
old at the time of his encounter his mother owned a tobacco farm on Birch
Road in Mount Pleasant Ontario Canada on the afternoon of July 6th
1975 he was walking the tobacco Fields he was near his farm when he noticed the
shiny domed metallic object just sitting in the fields about 2400 ft away from
The Farmhouse and he immediately thought to himself it's a flying saucer that is
a flying saucer but oddly as if placed in his head by an outside force he said
another thought immediately came which is no it's just a tanker truck a shiny
tanker that's all it is now forget the fact that this was in a field with
nobody around it that if it had truly been a tanker truck he would have seen it drive in and that it would have had
to cross over a line of 10in irrigation pipes which would have blocked its path
but he didn't really think of this he just gave it a few more studious glances then strangely he just ignored it and he
actually completely forgot about it as Joseph says I could see a shiny Dome
thing sitting there I didn't realize what it was I thought it might have been a a shiny trucker or a tank doing some
spraying and never dawned on me to come out I couldn't even judge how tall it was all I could see was kind of a dome
was quite a size I thought gee that might be a UFO then I thought the hell
with it so strangely after just dismissing this object which he thought was strange he completely forgot about
it which is another strange detail it was 2 days later at 11:00 a.m. he was
feeling weirdly off he said he decided to quit working for the day this is not something he normally did he went home
this really surprised his wife this was not like him but after having lunch he
did return to work and he walked out into the fields and this is when he came upon a 30 to 40t wide roughly circular
area of crushed and burned tobacco plants this was exactly in the area
where he had seen this alleged Flying Saucer 2 days earlier there were no
Footprints no tire tracks which completely debunks his earlier thought that this might be a tank truck and he
stared at it in Wonder trying to figure out if somebody might vandalize his field or playing some kind of prank on
him and this is when he suddenly and spontaneously remembered this object he
had seen 2 days earlier sitting in this exact area so he examined the circle carefully
and did find two spots of a reddish purple substance he bent down and
actually touched them and he found them to be kind of oily in texture spongy and
slippery they were about as big as a fist and seemed to penetrate deep into this soil as Joseph says it looked like
a type of oil but it couldn't be I'm the only one who's been out here with a
machine and I didn't drive over that spot even if I did the cultivator behind
me would have turned this spot over so realizing how unusual this all was he
called his brother Charles who's an attorney Charles arrived at the scene examined the area and was he who
suggested calling the local Brantford police which Joe did now Joseph's
brother Charles did collect samples of this oily like substance which were in
fact sent to the Forensic Science Center in Toronto for scientific
analysis now per Douglas Lucas the director of the center the study
revealed that this substance was in fact not oil they tested it for radioactivity
that came out NE negative a study of the tobacco plants did show a reddish brown
streak within the circle the plants themselves again were not only flattened but were dried and burned researcher
Leonard coraki visited the spot and he got a sample of these tobacco plants for analysis
which revealed that it contained apparently sand and what they described as an oily silicon based substance of
unknown composition so apparently that was never resolved what this substance was the
strange events continued when 3 Days Later three alleged UFO researchers one
from Canada and two from the US arrived asked and were granted by Joe permission
to examine The Landing traces Joe took them there when one of them remarked on this strange radio
noise asked who was playing a radio none of them were it didn't even have a radio
so they all listened and heard nothing at first but then suddenly all three of them heard a strange female voice it was
speaking in an unrecognizable language in a low tone and this persisted for
about 3 minutes it seemed to be coming from very nearby them but there was no body there and as Joe says I'll never
forget it as long as I live he said that this voice was quote not of this world
there was a weird Flawless kind of flowing this to the voice he said almost like someone was doing a data reading
and had this sort of quote out of this world quality and that left Joe quite
frightened he said it almost felt like something was trying to take over his mind and telling him to return to his
house so he told the man I'm not staying here anymore and he quickly left the area along with the Canadian researcher
the two Americans stayed behind but only very briefly they quickly came running
after Joe looking quite frightened and said that they saw something moving in the branches located about 150 ft away
so for some reason all four men were very much Shook Up by this and this case
continued to draw attention a further investigation revealed that the neighboring farmer had not seen anything
unusual but as Joseph says they can call me a nut if they want but until somebody
can come up with a better explanation for all this burnt and flattened tobacco
until somebody gives me a better explanation I don't know what to say so far anybody who's been out there can't
deny it was a UFO I know people are going to think I'm a Nut but I don't care in 35 years of growing tobacco here
I have never seen anything like it now there are some people who tried to explain this away as a lightning strike
which is a little absurd because it certainly does not explain what Joseph saw sitting in his field but one thing
that really bothered him about all this was his strange dismissal of The Craft despite how weird it obviously was as
Joe says people asked me why I didn't go out there I can't tell you why I didn't
something prompted me not to somehow it didn't interest me for a reason there's
another strange detail before Joseph had even reported the event to the police he
saw a black limousine with Arizona plates drive up on his property straight
up the road that was closest to these Landing traces and these men came out and they went straight to this spot as
if they already knew where these Landing traces were that's odd so it's an amazing case
was never debunked or proven to be a hoax in fact researcher and author Bob Mitchell wrote a fulllength book about
the case called incident at Pleasant Ridge a Canadian UFO mystery and he went
on the whole lecture circuit talking about it it's a truly amazing case hard to deny a case like that one I mean you
can see the photographs of the UFO landing traces the witnesses themselves
came forward allowed the real names to be used to meet one of the most fascinating aspects of this case is that
the witness sees this UFO real close up and then immediately sort of just
dismisses it and even that puzzled the witness himself because uh he felt
almost as if there was an outside influence kind of coming at him saying
pay no attention to the man behind the curtain type of thing this is not the Droid you're looking for I don't know
perhaps that's a natural psychological reaction but I certainly do wonder about it let's move to the next case this one
is very well known in the country where it occurred I call this one transformed
by a UFO this occurred on October 1st 1977 in torus Spain and yeah a very
well-known case this one has some quite alarming physiological effects but also
some what I would call Mental effects I guess or spiritual effects it's certainly an interesting
case of a very close encounter involving two children primarily though there were
other Witnesses and one of these children was affected so profoundly by his encounter
that it would change the course of his life forever this very weird case was
researched by AER himz and appeared in his Spanish language book anigma scen
RVE Unsolved Mysteries it's a very well-known case in Spain but outside of
the US I don't think it's very welln at all certainly qualifies as weird the
case involves mainly two young boys the primary witness is 7-year-old Martin
Rodriguez and his friend Fernando carabellos was early in the evening of
October 1st 1977 and Martin and Fernando and and
several other boys were playing hide-and seek this is in the streets near their homes in the outskirts of toras this is
in Ved this is in valid Spain so they had found this deserted
structure near the n122 motorway this is sort of an
abandoned Barn Martin thought this would be a good place to hide but he knew this place and knew that homeless people and
unsavory characters sometimes took Refuge there it had no roof it had broken windows it was
totally abandoned but yeah it was occasionally used by people so to check if anybody was inside Martin picked up a
rock threw it hoping to frighten away anyone hiding
inside now to his shock he throws this rock into this area and both boys heard
this rock strike something metallic so this got them very curious
and the boys carefully walked around and inside to see what the Rock had struck
now once inside they were amazed to see this very large metallic craft sort of
pear-shaped or teardrop shaped was sitting on three thick Landing legs
which looked like they were composed of girds almost this craft was about 9 ft
tall six feet wide it had three circular Windows which were illuminated by pink
and blue lights coming from inside the craft in the center bottom section of
the craft there was a closed door kind of with a central divider much like a
modern elevator they also noticed weird cylindrical pipes or protrusions or
exhaust pipes on the right side they appeared to be emitting Steam and the
craft itself was emitting a low sound now the two boys slowly began to
approach this craft when it began to immediately rise off the ground and at the same moment a thin multicolored beam
of light came out from the craft apparently just above the door section
striking Martin on the chest he immediately became unable to move he
stood there clutching his stomach Fernando actually tried to grab him and
pull him away to safety but wasn't able to budge him could not move him so
Fernando ran from the structure to call his friends for help now as Marchant says the feeling I had
was that there was something inside that object something that left me paralyzed without allowing me to move that's when
I started to feel dizzy and started to lose Consciousness that was the last image I had so Martin remembered being
struck by this beam of light being unable to move he felt himself losing Consciousness falling backwards and he
watched this craft rise higher up became surrounded by Steam the landing gear
retracted and this craft flew away it was apparently viewed by his friends now
Fernando and his friends returned to find Martin semiconscious unable to speak they picked him up rushed him to
his house his parents examined him his pupils were dilated his skin T started
to turn an unhealthy yellow poar so he was not doing well and at some point his
parents decided to take him to the dando on Simo Hospital in
valad now meanwhile Martin's father and a friend went to the sighting location
examined the structure and the spot where the craft had landed and did find three triangular depressions and a
section of burned soil which they said emitted a strong sulfur odor soil
samples were later collected which showed that the soil had been exposed to a temperature of about 600° C C this is
about 1,112 de F now at the hospital Mar's condition
was diagnosed as pretty serious he started vomiting he couldn't see he had
severe stomach pains he had vertigo and eventually fell into a near comos like
State now while he did recover he had some pretty serious health problems and
was later diagnosed with hydris and excess of fluid built up in
the brain now there was no sign of this before his UFO encounter but afterwards
he did have to undergo a series of 14 serious surgical procedures several of
which actually involved opening his skull so here's another weird thing
about all this there was an strange Silver Lining to this encounter Martin did make a full recovery he does still
bear some scars but he soon went on to develop an incredible memory a greatly
increased intelligence an ability to solve logical problems far beyond his years he used to have a lot of trouble
at school but not any longer and this really surprised everyone especially
Martin's teacher because this encounter and the problems he had afterwards had kept him out of school for quite a long
time no Martin says he has also had encounters with a strange 6ot tall
entity with a long gray face wearing a robe and belt and levitating off the
ground again Martin's case is very well known he's given many many interviews
about it it's certainly an odd event that is an
undeniably concerning case I do have some questions about it the description
of the craft itself is somewhat how would I put this primitive I with the
gridlike landing legs these little sort of
exhaust pipes coming out of the side of the UFO makes me wonder if this could possibly have been a reverse engineered
craft it's one of the frustrating aspects about doing this research is because we're only getting a limited
view of what's going on I do suspect that that craft was manned but by ET I
don't know could to me another really interesting aspect is not only the physiological reactions
but how this witness became much more intelligent uh this is a really interesting aspect to UFO encounters
that does turn up not a lot but it's fairly consistent so I wonder about that
as well still a lot more questions than answers it's one of the reasons I do this research I think there's a lot to
learn from cases like these now let's move to the next one and I had to
include this one because while it was somewhat frightening for the witnesses there's a really amusing aspect to it as
well I call this one the UFO that opened the window this one occurred on April 12
1979 in Brockton Massachusetts there was a huge wave of sightings going on at the
time but this one encounter was just a bit different than the rest in late
March and early April 1975 a pretty intense wave of sightings involving a very unusual looking craft
swept through the Skies of Eastern and Southeastern Massachusetts on March 23rd a newsman by
the name of Jerry Lopez at WHDH in Boston said he was driving down Route 24
this is near Route 106 in Brockton with him was Steve saaia another newsman when
they both saw an unidentified light moving overhead in fact as Jerry Lopez says we stopped
at a light and this thing was coming towards us we got out of the car and it passed right over us it was a perfectly
clear night and that's how we were able to get a good look at it was 3 days
later on March 26 Steve sabaa saw it again this time over the Massachusetts
Turnpike in Newton 5 days later Jerry Lopez was at the home of Vin Maloney in brain tree
all these locations are right near each other when he saw it again himself as he says it was a perfectly clear night and
I knew immediately what it was there was nothing else in the sky so he went directly to the police while it was
still there and had to literally drag three officers out to see it and as he
says they all saw it but when I suggested we drive over that way they
didn't want any part of it now it turned out that the police in nearby Randolph
had been receiving numerous calls over the past 2 days or so about UFO sightings in fact patrolman Joe
previti got a call from Anne flarey of Norway Avenue in Randolph saying that a
UFO was hovering over her house so he went there and as he says she showed me
a light in the sky but I don't know it looked like a light but I really don't know what it was there wasn't a star in
the sky I saw I gave her the number to report it and she was happy then I got into my squad
car and looked straight ahead so apparently he didn't want any part of it
still the strange sightings continued and they seemed to come closer and closer for example on April 2nd just a
few days later a resident of Melrose said he saw UFO which actually shot down
a beam of light right on him causing temporary paralysis he said on April 5th
a man from Brookline said he saw a large red light with yellow lights encircling
it so a lot of sightings were going on at this time and events came to a very
strange climax on April 12 1979 early on that evening a husband and
wife and their two young kids were driving back to their home in Randolph after visiting the grocery store and
this is when they all saw an oddly shaped object covered with lights at a very low altitude in the sky they said
its shape was hard to make out as there were so many lights they said it kind of looked like a pork chop or the top of a
baby grand piano the lights were all white they said they saw a large red one
on top they also saw a large Spotlight beaming straight down the subject was
very low just above the telephone poles all the witnesses were excited by its
very very unusual appearance but little did they know how strange events were about to become because after watching
it for just a few moments they lost sight of it and as soon as it was out of view all four Windows of the family car
went down by themselves and then back up again by themselves then they went down
again halfway and back up again at this point the wife turned to her husband and told him stop fooling around
he told her that he had both hands on the wheel and that it wasn't him doing it so moments later they stopped at a
red light and once again the windows went back down again and up again as
they continued driving they saw this object reappear and it now appeared to
be following them and it was pretty clear to them that it was the UFO that was responsible for the car windows
going up and down so they quickly drove home parked near near their residence and the UFO was still with them now
hovering just across the street they were all quite nervous about this the
father shut off the engine pulled out the key and at this point the car windows proceeded to go down and up
again and the object moved directly over the car this caused the wife to reach
the breaking point she shouted at her husband do not get out of the car and buried her head in her lap in fear now
her husband although he was afraid he didn't want to show it he didn't want to scare his wife or his children so he got
out of the car and his 5-year-old son jumped out and stood right next to him
staring up at this object while the father pretended to unload the groceries
but was really keeping his eye on this object as well so as they're both looking at it this beam of light comes
down from this object and Strikes him directly on the head it immediately shifts to his 5-year-old son neither of
them felt any heat or any effect whatsoever from this beam of light
however the father says that quote when the beam hit me I was scared
stiff now the mother she didn't even want to talk or think about this as she
says I try to forget about it so after this beam hit the father and Sun it
immediately retracted the object moved on floating down the street then up and
away and this huge wave of sightings pretty much came to an
end I saw a silver streak around like a Round Disc zooming through the skies
slowing down suddenly stopping for a few minutes and then going on its way
again yes I do with all the research today it certainly puts a person to thinking that there must be something to
it I not think so I I don't hear anything I don't see anything sure I uh
I believe in them uh uh people say that they see him I believe
him I think there's a great possibility that they exist have you ever seen one no but I'd like
to what do you think they might be I think there could be civilization on other
planets well maybe they see either um
meteor or some Fallen object from out of space uh anything like that but there's
um I don't think there's no flying saucers and no I don't really believe in
that I don't think it's right I don't believe in it at
all have you ever met anybody who thought they had seen one no I never did
I never met one that seen it I mean come on that's undeniably a
weird case I don't know that I've heard of any other case where UFOs affect you
know a car in that way and it's an undeniable case because there are four Witnesses and this is a case that
occurred during a pretty large UFO wave with police officer Witnesses news
people becoming Witnesses I and clearly something very interesting was going on
in that area that time all right now let's move to another case this is one
I've been holding on to for a little while hoping I could find more information on it but I did find some I
think you'll find it a really fascinating case I like this case because it's a very encouraging and
positive case I call this one a UFO saved my life this is actually the title
that the witness herself gave to her case when she wrote it up in a UFO
magazine this occurred sometime in 1980 in Canton Ohio that is an approximate
date the exact date was not given but I think you'll find this a really weird
and unusual case the witness in this case is Julie Rigs of Canton Ohio and
she wrote an article about her UFO experiences in the main 1981 issue of UFO sightings magazine she says her
first UFO sighting occurred when she was only five or six years old date is not given at the time she lived at an Old
Farm in a rural area on the outskirts of Canton and as Julie says
I saw a beautiful sailing craft grazing the Treetops on the horizon I ran across
the field and the craft seemed to be waiting for me I waved as I came closer I seemed to sense that the creatures
piloting that ship were friends I got almost directly below the ship and I
looked up trying to find a window or something so I could see who was inside the ship was immense to my young eyes it
was round with a hemisphere in the center very much the classic Flying Saucer that has been cited so often it
didn't revolve or spin around was almost motionless I waved again and it paused
and then it arked away leaving me waving blinking up into the bright Sun so at the time Julie didn't realize
how unusual her experience was until much later but even then seeing all the
fear and skepticism surrounding this subject she kept it mostly private but
at night she says she would sometimes lie awake and think about her sighting and wish for another encounter she says
sometimes she got a response sort of the strange drumming or chatter in her head
and she also began to realize that she had a very acute awareness and strong intuitive abilities which she linked to
her sighting she said she would sense the death of her relative days before it occurred or know the answers to
questions on a school test or the contents of a wrapped gift which yeah again she connected this
somehow to her encounter now she grew up and as an adult her interest in UFOs
increased and it was around 1980 again date approximate she decided to attend a
local UFO convention in Canton she paid her $3 entrance fee this
was that night she was disappointed to see that the convention hall was filled
mostly with comic books games other flashy not really UFO related items so
she walked out and this is when things became very weird it was a very dark night and two men apparently very
skeptical of UFOs approached her as she left this convention and began taunting
her about visiting this UFO convention and she told them that she believed in
UFOs but they just Jered at her and actually followed her to her car so she
was pretty nervous about this she got in her car and drove drove off and to her dismay she saw that these men were
following her in another car in fact they zoomed up to her pulled right alongside her very threateningly
swerving towards her so now Julie was angry and Afraid and she sped up to get
away from them but they still followed her she ended up going faster and faster reaching 80 and then 90 mil hour but
these pursuers would not leave her alone and this is when things became very
weird as Julie says it was then that I saw the Silvery form the saucer
illumined in the Moonlight at first I wasn't sure that it was real after so
many years I was shocked to have seen it again but I was overjoyed I drove faster
taking whatever Road seemed closer to the saucer I was practically oblivious to the car chasing me coming up
alongside me just a few inches away now what happened next left Jud
absolutely a struck and grateful to be alive as she says in her own words the
saucer seemed to angle off to the right toward an open field I sensed the way
and I veered off the road onto a green pasture and as the thing seemed to stop
I screeched the car to a stop but I didn't hear the silence I heard more
screeching more sounds the sound of the other car as It sped Dead Ahead right
into a beaten up old truck that had been left abandoned on the roadway had I not
made the turn to follow the saucer I would have hit that truck Instead at that speed I could never have stopped in
time the two traveling just a few feet behind me could not halt the Fateful
crash so Julie jumped out of her car ran through the field waving at the UFO
watching the silver craft as it Rose upwards and up into the Starry Sky he's
absolutely convinced that the UFO beings present prevented what would have been for her a fatal accident as she says by
all reckonings I should be Stone dead at this moment only a long-standing faith
in our visitors from space and in the Divine forces which guide them saved me
from an agonizing and violent death the saucer had saved my life so Julie walked on the highway to
examine the wreckage she looked up caught a last glimpse of this craft as it moved away
and as Julie says I was frightened but only because of the close call not
because of the saucer so nothing is said about what happened to these two other people but a
final end note to this experience did reveal a very interesting synchronicity
as Julie says was not until dawn that I realized where I was the place familiar
even in the dark became distinct in the Morning Light the pasture was what was
left of of the Old Farm the road had taken me back outside Canton almost
exactly to the spot where I had discovered my special craft so many years ago so how about that not the only
case I know of where a person claims that their life was saved by a UFO and
certainly not the only case I know of where people feel like their psychic abilities were given a really
significant boost as a result of contact or not the only case where people feel
like they are being watched over and protected by ETS so all of these to me
make that a pretty interesting and important case now here's another case which I
found super fascinating all the cases in this Bunch it's probably the least in
terms of affecting the environment probably just call this a simple sighting Close Encounter of the
first kind but I found the behavior of the UFO fascinating that's why I wanted
to include it it is a firsthand witness account multiple Witnesses actually but
I Al always love it when there's significant quote quotes from the
witness themselves and that's certainly true in this case which I call a UFO
beams for boys this occurred sometime in the early 1980s in the White Horse area of the
Yukon territory in Canada this next case comes from the ufob BC website it's
probably the least weird of all the cases in this compilation but it still does have some odd elements to it was
one evening in the early 1980s the main witness Mike this is a pseudonym was
about 5 years old he was walking with his brother and two friends who were also Brothers down a small Gravel Road
near their home located in a small subdivision called wolf Creek this is in
a rural area of white horse in the Yukon Territory Canada it's a new subdivision
only a few houses the four boys were all joking around when they all noticed strange colored lights shining through
the trees to the right there were red lights blue green very bright as Mike
says we all took notice and stared in Surprise then all of a sudden a UFO
moved silently out from the right just above the tree line its speed was approximately 5 m an hour
its size 50 ft in diameter the UFO stopped directly in the middle of the
gravel road approximately 20 ft forward and about 50 ft up there was no
mistaking what it was because it was right there now this object was totally
silent the only sound they could hear was the wind Whispering through the trees at this point this object moved
directly over their small group and stopped so it clearly saw them all four
boys were absolutely amazed at what happened next as Mike says when it
stopped a blue beam shot out of the craft directly between the four of us I
was petrified with fear my mind went into shock so what happened next is
vague but I remember the beam shot back up into the craft my brother threw me
into the ditch on the side of the road I looked across the other side to see the other brother
in the opposite ditch the UFO hung there motionless for a second then started to
move in the direction that it was originally going the lights were just as bright as before but only on the left
side of the road and then it was gone so sometime following this encounter when he was a young adult Mike's parents
separated he ended up moving later to Vancouver and it was 12 years later that
he reconnected with his brother and Mike asked if he remembered this encounter and he was surprised by this question
his brother was because it turned out his brother had completely forgotten all about it until Mike asked him this
question as Mike says I've tried to get him to write down what he remembers but
he won't all he will tell me is that he remembers that's it I guess he doesn't
want people to think he's nuts I have kept on him about it but he won't change his mind Mike says that the this
encounter had a profound effect on him as he says was very interesting so much
in fact that it changed my way of thinking I have constantly thought what
I would have been like if I had not been there at that place and time definitely
more ignorant to the possibilities in life these thoughts have plagued me for 15 years I have followed the Paranormal
with great interest all my life I have even thought of becoming a UFO investigator myself as far as I know my
experience is classified as one of the kinds of Close Encounters being within 50 ft of a
UFO I'm not an avid believer in alien abductions but there is that
possibility I was only 5 years old but the memory has always been Vivid in my mind except for certain aspects of the
encounter like when the beam came down or if there were any windows on the craft it's like opening a door you can't
close I have told this story many times uncaring if anyone believes me or not
because I believe and I know what I saw so Mike has no interests in any
attention or publicity he only told his encounter because as he says I just had
to get it off my chest tell someone who would find an interest in such a thing I
will admit that's a fairly typical but very close encounter but I thought it
was super interesting because why the heck is this UFO sending down a beam of light right in the center of this group
of of four kids was it trying to impress them in some way the witness does admit
that it's possible there's more to it and given the fact that there was some Amnesia problems associated with this
encounter with at least one of the witnesses the brother makes me wonder about it well the other witness himself
said that he's not entirely sure if he remembers all the details either and
that is a red flag very could possibly have been deeper levels of contact there
but certainly a fascinating firsthand witness case now let's move to the last and
final case of this compilation this one I included because it's very unusual
it's very weird unfortunately it has not been as far as I know professionally
investigated by an experienced UFO researcher I got this from a newspaper
article actually in a UFO website but it's so unusual I just had to include it
I've heard of cases like it but not many I call this one a miniature UFO this
occurred in October 2016 in Worthing in the UK this last and
final case is quite short but very weird it has not been investigated as far as I know by any researchers but the main
witness 73-year-old retiree Christopher Van helden a resident of Finland UK is
sticking to his story he says that one evening he decided to take a walk through the grounds of the beautiful
Worthing Golf Course located in Worthing you can see it here and this is when he
had a very weird experience as Christopher says I noticed a silver
object about 5 in high sitting on the ground it looked like quality silver
metal I went to pick it up and it wouldn't move at all so it appeared as
if this object was being held To The Ground by some Force he said it looked smooth shiny round completely solid
though did have sort of a black line around the middle as Christopher says I
tapped it with my foot and suddenly it took off it took off with such force
that it threw me backwards it went off so quickly it was like the speed of light I could feel the force on me and
then it was gone there was no smoke no smell no debris I searched the whole
area but there was nothing so that was it Christopher feels confident that this
object was not a military drone certainly not human-made but he's the
first to say that he has no idea what it was as he says it wasn't anything
logical it's bizarre it impressed him enough to share his story with the mid
Sussex times who published it and it remains another small contribution to
the baffling number of UFO reports coming from all over the world and it's a good example of the many reports of
tiny little UFOs that people have seen again admittedly that is a case that
certainly raises some questions in terms of its authenticity not being researched
or investigated by an experienced researcher but the witness felt it was
important enough to report it which he did he allowed his real name to be used
as photograph I think that brings an extra level of credibility to it fortunately it is a single witness case
there's no real hard evidence to support it but given that there are many other
cases like it I have to wonder about it certainly doesn't sound like a normal
drone you know from our military perhaps though who knows it could be either way
it's certainly an unusual event that I think deserves inclusion in this
episode so that's it for today 10 very unusual cases weird weird weird UFOs are
certainly known for their High strangeness but let's face it high strangeness is our
interpretation it's only because we don't understand these things that we we call them strange or
weird for example the word paranormal or Supernatural is a bit of a misnomer
nothing is really breaking the laws of the universe in my opinion and that's certainly true of UFOs it's just that we
lack understanding of the mechanisms behind how all these things work so we
still have a lot of learning to do and that's what I love about this subject UFOs and ETS it offers us an excellent
opportunity to to expand our thinking think out of the box explore new
paradigms and really research ideas that are completely out of our world viw this
is a subject that has endless levels to it and I think we can only learn more
and more and more from continuing to research and study these accounts it's a
good time for euphology there's a lot of interest now being paid to this subject
in terms of officialdom so I think we're getting closer and closer to disclosure
to everyone on this planet accepting the fact that we are not alone that we do
have ETS visiting our planet or have been for quite some time so thank you
again for watching you guys I truly appreciate it I hope you found this episode entertaining and a little
educational too and yeah I just really want to thank you so much for watching so let's sign
off until next time keep asking those hard questions keep searching for the
truth and most important of all keep having fun I will see you all next
Friday be well [Music]
