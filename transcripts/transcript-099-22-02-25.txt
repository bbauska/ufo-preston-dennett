THE CAT PEOPLE: A TRUE STORY OF UFO CONTACT
Feb 25, 2022

Summary:
Feb 25, 2022
In 1956, ten-year-old Robert Hambly (pseudonym) was enjoying an afternoon of ice-skating with a dozen other children in a local park in the small town of Havre, Montana. Looking up, they were amazed to see several silvery spheres scooting across the sky. Robert had never heard about UFOs and had no idea what he was seeing, but he knew it wasn't normal.

Only a few days later, Robert's life changed forever. He awoke in the middle of the night to see a strange figure standing next to his bed. To Robert, the figure looked just like a three-foot-tall humanoid cat. It had a large, bald head, huge dark cat-like eyes, and a thin body. Unable to move, Robert was filled with fear. After a short time, the figure vanished. But for the next several years, Robert was visited over and over again.

Meanwhile, many miles away in Las Vegas, Nevada, a little girl, Melissa Branson, (pseudonym) woke up in her bedroom to see cat-like ETs moving through the wall. She told her parents who said Melissa must have had a nightmare. But Melissa knew better: she had been awake. And when it kept happening, she knew something very strange was happening to her.

Later, as a teen-ager, Melissa saw a UFO near her home, but still didn't connect it to her childhood visitations.

Both Melissa and Robert grew up, and many years later, they met, started dating, fell in love and got married. UFOs and aliens were the farthest thing from their minds. But in 1992, UFOs came roaring back into their lives. They watched the television miniseries "Intruders," and they realized that they both had very similar experiences with cat-like extraterrestrials. They also discovered that there was a history of UFO encounters on both sides of their families. 

Then came a series of more UFO sightings. It wasn't long after the UFO sightings that, one night, the cat-like ETs returned. Frightened and angry, Robert mentally fought with the ETs, vanquishing them from his life forever.

Robert and Melissa's case contains unique and interesting elements that provide some important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. Both feel that they were contacted by the same group of ETs who may have even brought them together. Both experienced telepathic contact with the UFOs. Perhaps most important, Robert was able to end his encounters by ordering the ETs to leave him alone. Their case is an important addition to our understanding of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.

hello everyone my name is preston dennett and welcome to a new episode of UFOs in the paranormal 
i call this episode the cat people 
this episode is about two people a man and a woman both who have had lifelong experiences with UFOs 
and extraterrestrials that they describe as looking very much like hairless humanoid 
cats it's a very interesting episode and I think it provides some unique and important insights 
into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrials that are visiting our planet 
our story today begins in 1956 in a little town called haver this is located in northern montana 
and robert hamley is the main witness that's not his real name he wants to be anonymous 
and again this was in 1956 robert was just a little boy and one day he was out skating ice 
skating with about a dozen other neighborhood kids in a little park in his hometown of haver montana 
and looking up all the kids saw several objects scooting across the sky 
robert described them as metallic round in shape and moving very quickly 
they were clearly not planes or helicopters or balloons or anything like that everyone stopped 
skating and stared at them because they were so unusual and they said wow and cool and just 
watch these objects move all the way across the sky until they disappeared off into the distance 
and then everyone continued skating robert was very much impressed he had no idea what 
these objects could be he'd never heard of UFOs all he knew was that these were not 
normal and it really stuck in his mind especially because of what happened next it was shortly after 
this sighting that robert started to be visited by these strange cat like humanoids in his bedroom 
robert's bedroom was located in the basement of his home and he woke up one evening to see two or 
three of these cat-like humanoids standing around his bed he described him as about three foot tall 
very slender large heads no hair dark wrap around eyes and he described them as looking very much 
like cats but humanoid and having no hair and it was very frightening for him 
it was always the same he'd wake up see these things around his bed 
and was paralyzed and consumed with fear and this went on for years as robert says in his own words 
i would have these horrendous nightmares I would call them nightmares where these big eyed 
creatures would come and I would feel paralyzed all I would ever remember is that face that 
side profile of this face with huge eyes to me it was just this horrible nightmare for years I 
couldn't do anything about it this went on until I was about 16. so after years of going through this 
robert had had enough he was tired of living like this and he decided that 
next time they came he would confront them and tell them to go away and never come back 
and that's exactly what he did and I'll just let robert describe what happened 
as robert says when it happened I told whatever it was I said this is it it's either you or me 
but only one of us is going to come out of this thing I've had enough of it and he says 
all that night he had a battle of wills with these cat-like humanoids he doesn't remember all of it 
just then staring at him and him fighting back mentally he called it a battle of wills 
and at some point they apparently left he woke up the next morning they were gone of course and 
he was shocked to see that all of his blankets and bed sheets were completely swept off of his 
bed but what's very interesting is following this battle of wills these cat-like humanoids 
never came back at least not for a very long time meanwhile many hundreds of miles away 
down in las vegas valley in nevada another little girl I will call melissa branson it's not her 
real name she also requested to be anonymous was having very similar experiences to robert 
of course las vegas valley uh was not nearly as populated then in the 1950s as it is now 
and melissa would wake up in the middle of the night to see these cat-like eyes coming through 
the wall and staring at her and it was always the same as soon as she'd see them she'd usually pass 
out a few times she does remember them rushing towards her bed and grabbing her and it was very 
very frightening for her she did complain to her parents but her parents said oh you must be having 
nightmares melissa protested she said that she was awake when this was happening but her parents 
didn't know what to do and melissa wasn't getting much help from them so she just kind of clammed 
up about it but over the years throughout her childhood they visited her over and over again 
and then finally in her mid-teens just like robert they stopped coming they did leave melissa with 
some profound anxieties once she went to an arcade where there was a little booth with a 
gypsy fortune-telling witch in it with large dark eyes that sent chills down her spine she wasn't 
quite sure why she didn't quite connect it to her childhood experiences but anything similar to 
that caused her pretty bad anxiety she had these little china dolls with large dark staring eyes 
those gave her the creeps but what really upset her was a series of art prints by a very famous 
artist by the name of margaret keane who is very famous for drawing large eyed waif children and 
large eyed pets animals dogs and cats and such and whenever she saw those art prints it would just 
send melissa over the edge with anxiety again it was those dark staring eyes that really scared her 
but these uh experiences did stop at some point and her anxieties weren't so bad that it was you 
know crippling her or anything but she did connect it to these experiences as a kid and uh she did 
have a UFO sighting uh around this time it was actually 1960 when she had her first UFO sighting 
she was outside of her home in las vegas and looking up so what she describes as a rusty brown 
maroon colored light it moved swiftly across the sky suddenly stopped and turned at a right 
angle and darted away clearly not a helicopter or plane or a balloon or anything like that 
it absolutely convinced her that UFOs were real but that's as far as it went and 
after that her UFO experiences stopped for a long time she grew up as did robert hamley and robert 
went down to visit las vegas and met melissa and they hit it off immediately they started dating 
they fell in love they got married and they were living happily ever after it was many many years 
later when UFOs suddenly marched back into their life and neither of them had thought about UFOs 
or their childhood experiences for years and then in 1992 melissa was at her place of work a museum 
in clark county nevada and she was cleaning up the storeroom and opened a box and found a series of 
letters from pioneering aviator george crockett and in this box of letters from george crockett 
she saw that these letters were actually uh involving correspondence between george crockett 
and howard hughes and they were referencing UFOs and underground bases and large budgets 
of millions of dollars so it really impressed her and brought UFOs back to the forefront of her mind 
and it was around this time that she and her husband robert sat down on their couch one evening 
to watch a television miniseries called intruders this television miniseries is 
based on bud hopkins book by the same name and involves of course people who are being visited 
by extraterrestrials greys and being taken on board and having very profound visitations and as 
they're watching this movie uh melissa remembered that she had had these experiences as a kid 
and she turned to her husband robert and says you know that happened to me when I was a little girl 
robert was stunned and he said you know what that also happened to me when I was a little boy 
and they compared notes and were shocked to see how incredibly similar their stories were 
both described seeing these short figures with large dark cat-like eyes their stories were so 
similar that they wondered if they were dealing with the same types of ET's and a little more 
digging revealed that both their families on both sides of their families there was a history of 
ufo encounters and in fact robert's mother said that she had experienced very scary nighttime 
visitations by some type of entity and on another occasion she said that she was driving home 
and uh saw a cone of light shining down onto the field next to her from this object high in the sky 
and robert's father said that he was going to pick up his wife robert's mother from work where she 
worked at a hospital and saw this football shaped object hovering over the hospital it had colored 
lights all around it it was just hovering there stationary in place and very much impressed him as 
not being anything normal and it turned out that melissa's aunt also had encounters way back in 
the 1930s melissa's aunt was visiting california and was actually in santa monica overlooking the 
santa catalina channel which is of course well known for having high levels of UFO activity 
and melissa's aunt said that she was standing on the beach in santa monica when this bright 
ball of light came in from the ocean and hovered very close to her frightened her quite a bit she 
had a sense of timelessness she felt paralyzed and finally this object darted off so yes both sides 
of their family have a history of UFO encounters which is absolutely something we see in this field 
and following this series of events they both started having UFO sightings again it was 
in 1994 melissa was outside when she saw a bright glowing light much brighter than any star 
and she stared at it trying to figure out what it could be and was wondering if it was you know 
aware that she was looking at it at that exact point it suddenly shrank down and disappeared 
but she felt like it was sort of responding to her or was definitely aware that she was watching it 
and as was just two months later the same exact thing happened she had the 
same feeling it was watching her knew she was watching it and it shrank down and disappeared 
and her husband saw her looking up and said what's going on and she said I think I just saw a UFO 
and robert was amazed and it was a short time after that 
that he had his own encounter and again it involved this weird telepathic element to it 
robert was had a strange impulse to look up at the sky this was during the day 
and looking up he was amazed to see quite high up there a silver disc like object 
it was pretty much stationary in the sky and he had the distinct feeling 
that it was looking at him and knew that he was looking at it and at that moment it quickly 
winked out and disappeared but impressed robert enough that he decided he was going to get a 
camera so in case this thing appeared again you would try to get a picture 
and of course it did appear again and it started the same way he had a very strong impulse to look 
up and he looked up and sure enough there was this disk and he had his camera right near him 
and he attempted to take a picture and I'll just let robert describe what happened next 
as robert says it was one of those I can feel somebody looking at me long distance kind of thing 
so when I had this feeling I should look up I did and there was another one it looked just like it 
and I thought my god I'm ready for it this time I reached in grabbed my camera turned around 
and it was not in the sky anymore so no picture and it was at this point that these 
cat-like humanoids came marching back full force into their life again 
it started one evening with melissa having a very odd feeling that something was going to happen 
as melissa says I just had the feeling that something was happening and I had to be ready 
for it it was a very odd feeling and when she woke up the next morning that feeling still persisted 
as she says something had been there in the house during the night it was just a strange 
experience I felt like all night long I had a very restless sleep I felt constantly on guard 
like you're expecting something or something's going on and you're ready to hit the floor 
so she told her husband robert about it and he gave her kind of an odd luck but he had to go 
to work so he quickly rushed off to work and when he came home he revealed that he had in 
fact seen these cat-like humanoids that night and I'll just quote robert again as robert says 
cat people is about the only way you can describe it if you put a cat head on these humanoid bodies 
they were dark almost black so you really could not determine what they were wearing it was just 
the shapes but you could see the features and the face and the closest thing I can come to is they 
had that kind of cat face morphed if you will so he as soon as he saw them they were leaning over 
melissa on her side of the bed and he shouted at them with a lot of force go away 
and they did they disappeared and melissa confirms this as melissa says and I quote 
i'll never forget it he walked in the front door and he just stood there and looked at me 
and he was looking at me with this very intense look on his face then he told me he had been 
thinking about what I said all day and he had to tell me about what happened during the night he'd 
woken up and he'd seen these three things he said they looked like cat like figures instead 
of a cat body it was almost a stick figure sort of body they weren't the size of cats 
they were much larger than cats but not as big as humans and they were on my side of the bed 
they were arranged in a row I think he felt a little bit like they might be threatening me 
but it just offended him and he basically told him to get the hell out and he said that at that point 
they one at a time sort of dematerialized I was feeling like I had been on guard all night and he 
recounted what had happened you know the feeling that something drops to the pit of your stomach 
it was just a further confirmation to me of what I had seen coming through the wall
so it was two weeks later that these cat people visited again and again robert was filled with 
fear and told them to go away as robert says it kind of had a menacing look I said go away 
and it just vanished so this turned out to be their last encounter 
with these cat-like humanoids robert forcefully told them to go away and they did 
so he successfully ended his encounters with these extraterrestrials it was not 
their last unexplained event they did have one weird event which they think is connected to this 
in which they woke up he woke up to see a apparition in his room he described it 
as sort of a gold sepia colored tubular shaped cloud-like apparition in the corner of his room 
he examined it closely for a few moments and decided he would just ignore it and it finally 
went away he told his wife the next morning but neither of them knew what to make of it as 
robert says that was kind of bizarre and that was the last of those kinds of things that happened
there is an interesting end note to this case robert's little brother came to visit and robert's 
little brother had always been jealous of robert because robert had his own room in the basement 
and robert's little brother really wanted it and when robert finally moved out of the house 
his little brother was super excited to take over the bedroom and started to move his things down 
there he's telling the story to robert he said he went down there and was moving his things in and 
hadn't been in that room for more than 15 minutes when something happened something very scary and 
robert asked him what happened and robert's brother refused to elaborate and said only 
i don't know what it was but it was horrible and he refused to talk about it at all 
so this is the story of robert and melissa and their encounters with cat-like humanoids 
i suspect there's more to it that they don't remember I did present this story in my book 
wondrous and I think it's a very interesting account for a number of reasons uh one really 
interesting factor is that both robert and melissa believe they were having encounters with the same 
types of ETs and they wonder if they were brought together by the ETs and I have to wonder that too 
because that is something I've heard in many other cases another very interesting detail is 
they both having telepathic contact to some degree with these UFOs that they saw many people will 
have an impulse to look up and see a UFO and sure enough that's what happened with robert especially 
another very interesting detail I think probably the most important takeaway from this case 
is that robert was able to end his encounters by forcefully telling these beings to go away
ufo researcher and ruffle wrote a book how to defend yourself against 
alien abduction and the number one method is basically using your willpower 
and telling these ET's to go away and this is exactly what robert did and he was successful 
at it and this just goes to show that if a person does want to end their encounters 
if they are experiencing too much fear and don't want this experience it is possible to do this 
so I think that is a very important aspect to this case and was really the main reason I wanted 
to present this episode to you today hope you've enjoyed it I want to thank you once again for 
watching I truly appreciate it and until next time keep searching for answers and keep having fun.
