          <h5>Oct 24, 2025 (1:03:23)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Most people agree that the chances of humans being the only 
		  intelligent life in the universe are infinitesimally small. It is almost inconceivable 
		  that humanity is alone. And an examination of reports involving strange humanoids shows 
		  very clearly that we are not alone. There is now a worldwide database containing tens of 
		  thousands of extraterrestrial humanoids. Cases go back more than 100 years. They involve 
		  a wide variety of witnesses and a wide variety of humanoids. This video presents ten 
		  incredibly strange cases of this kind, each adding another piece of the puzzle to solving 
		  the UFO mystery.</p>

          <p><b>A STRANGE AND INDESCRIBABLE BEAUTY</b>. One of the earliest humanoid reports in the 
		  United States occurred one evening in November 1897, in Lodi, California. Colonel Henry 
		  Glenville Shaw and his associate Camille Spooner were riding a carriage when they came upon 
		  three 7-foot-tall slender, bald humanoids standing in the road. A long interaction followed, 
		  ending with the witnesses chasing the humanoids to their craft.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MEN IN RUBBER SUITS</b>. Late on the evening of October 10, 1954, Willi 
		  Hoge (age 42) was driving outside Rinkerode, Germany when he saw what he first thought was 
		  a crashed plane. A closer observation, however, revealed it to be a disc-shaped craft, and 
		  standing underneath it were four 3-foot-tall humanoids. Willi watched them work on their 
		  craft for ten minutes until they entered inside it, and the craft quickly departed.</p>

          <p><b>DON’T THROW ROCKS AT THE ALIEN</b>. On <b>July 18, 1963</b>, four boys were playing 
		  near their homes in Fern Creek, Kentucky when a large cigar-shaped craft appeared overhead. 
		  It released a smaller disc-shaped craft which landed behind the trees. Moments later, a 
		  humanoid appeared wearing a jumpsuit and helmet. The boys threw dirt-clods at it, and the 
		  humanoid reacted by pointing a device at the boys, causing two of them to receive minor 
		  burns.</p>

          <p><b>TWO LITTLE HUMANOIDS</b>. On the <b>morning of October 23, 1965</b>, 57-year-old Jose 
		  Camilo Filho took a walk in the woods on the outskirts of Canhotinho, in Pernambuco, Brazil. 
		  Coming around a corner in the path, he saw two 3-foot-tall, little men wearing strange clothes. 
		  The humanoids seemed startled and took off in fear. At the same time, other witnesses in town 
		  saw a UFO pass overhead.</p>

          <p><b>THE MOST FRIGHTENING MOMENT OF MY LIFE</b>. On <b>November 18, 1967</b>, a young boy was 
		  in his home near Greenville, Ohio when two grays appeared. He was unable to move as they examined 
		  him then floated off to another room. He chased them and saw them leaving the house, joining three 
		  other gray aliens and walking into a large craft which had landed in their cornfield. This turned 
		  out to be the first of many encounters.</p>

          <p><b>IT’S TAKEN ME A LIFETIME</b>. Karen was eleven years old when, <b>one summer day in 1973</b>, 
		  her older sister called her outside their home in Paramus, New Jersey. Karen was shocked to see a 
		  massive cigar-shaped craft with portholes hovering overhead. Through the portholes, she could see 
		  three humanoids looking down at them. The craft darted off, and the two witnesses chased it down 
		  the highway in their car, where numerous other people also saw the craft.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING HAPPENED</b>. <b>JULY 1998</b>. WEST COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA. In <b>July of 1998</b>, an 
		  anonymous sheriff’s deputy woke up in the bedroom of his home in West Columbia, South Carolina. 
		  He was immobilized as he heard a buzzing sound and saw a strange light in his bedroom. Some days 
		  later, he woke up paralyzed, but now levitating above his bed, surrounded by gray aliens. A third 
		  incident occurred while on patrol and resulted in two hours of missing time.</p>

          <p><b>THEY DID NOT APPEAR HUMAN</b>. On <b>March 18, 2007</b>, Maria was taking a train from 
		  Rome to Viterbo, Italy when she noticed two strange women in the train car who did not appear 
		  human. They wore wigs, had no visible nose and very strange mouths. They were speaking a foreign 
		  language. When they stood, Maria was amazed to see that they had only four fingers.</p>
 
          <p><b>I KNOW WHAT IS OUT THERE</b>. At <b>3:00 am on June 2008</b>, 16-year-old Tracy was asleep 
		  on the couch in her aunt’s home in Spring Creek, Nevada. Waking up, she was terrified to see the 
		  front door open, blue-white light filling the room, and three short alien figures standing in the 
		  doorway looking at her. Suddenly, one of the grays approached her. It touched her cheek, and Maria’s 
		  fear left her. Instead, she felt great love coming from the being.</p>

          <p><b>A VERY PERSONAL EVENT</b>. One <b>evening in 2010</b>, a New Mexico security guard’s life 
		  changed forever. As he patrolled his assigned property in his vehicle, he came upon a gray alien 
		  standing in front of his car. It was visible for only 10 seconds, but long enough to identify the 
		  creature as not human. The incident became shrouded in a screen memory for some time, but the guard 
		  eventually recalled the truth.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, adding to the thousands of other accounts, making it undeniable that our planet is 
		  being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <h5>Oct 17, 2025 (0:59:44)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Onboard UFO encounters represent the cutting edge of UFO 
          research. These cases represent the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. They contain 
          more data than any other kind of UFO cases, and they have the potential to answer the 
          many questions surrounding this subject. This video presents eight exceptionally 
          unusual cases, each of which has received little or no publicity, and each which adds 
          to our knowledge of the nature of extraterrestrial contact.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING I’LL NEVER FORGET</b>. One hot <b>sunny summer day in 1951</b>, six-year-
          old Stephanie played in the backyard of her home in rural Louisa, Virginia. Suddenly a 
          disc-shaped craft appeared overhead, hovered, tilted and landed behind some trees. 
          Stephanie ran inside and told her grandmother who did not believe her. Later, as 
          Stephanie sat in her bedroom, she saw two gray aliens in her backyard. The next thing 
          she knew, it was 10:00 pm; she was missing ten hours of time. She soon began having 
          memories of being inside the craft, looking down on her town from above.</p>

          <p><b>THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING</b>. One <b>night in October 1975</b>, Michael (age 19) woke 
          up to find himself floating above his home in Rockville, Maryland, and into a classic 
          metallic flying saucer. Inside, he was levitated to a table. He was shocked to see an Air 
          Force military officer in full uniform standing next to him, and what appeared to be two 
          doctors. They proceeded to do some kind of operation, he believed, on his brain. At some 
          point he blacked out. Waking up the next morning, he wondered if it was a dream, but later, 
          hearing other accounts, he became convinced it really happened.</p>

          <p><b>I CANNOT REVEAL WHAT I SAW</b>. Gustavo was 19 years old and living in Funchal, 
          Portugal, when his life changed forever. Early one <b>morning in December 1977</b>, he 
          was awakened by a flying saucer hovering outside his bedroom, filling the room with light 
          and sending him a telepathic message. A few months later, he was visited by a female, 
          human-looking ET, and then had a close-up sighting of a disc-shaped craft. Then, in 
          <b>January 1979</b>, he was taken onboard a craft, given a medical examination, and was 
          transported to an alien world.</p>

          <p><b>A WARNING OF THINGS TO COME</b>. In <b>2019</b>, Gavin began to have weird memories 
          of being taken onboard a craft while a young boy in his family’s home in Texas. He soon 
          recalled being floated upwards into what appears to be a craft where he was greeted by 
          short human-looking figures who began to show him moving images of future calamities on 
          planet Earth. He had forgotten the entire encounter until the events he was shown began 
          to happen. Only then did his memory of the encounter return. He also recalled finding a 
          strange implant in his body as a teenager.</p>

          <p><b>I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO AFRAID IN ALL MY LIFE</b>. One <b>night in October 1990</b>, 
          Winifred Crause woke up her home in The Entrance, New South Wales, Australia, to sense 
          strange beings outside her home. Suddenly she found herself on an operating table inside 
          a room surrounded by grays. She felt like a bug as the grays were heedless of her protests 
          and roughly examined her. The next morning her body was sore. But she also reports a 
          dramatic increase in psychic abilities and soon became a world-famous psychic.</p>

          <p><b>YOU DON’T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM US</b>. On the <b>night of March 10, 1996</b>, 
          Morris (a high school student from Omaha, Nebraska) was out looking at the Hale-Bopp 
          comet when he saw a strange craft hovering nearby. It sent down a beam of light, and a 
          gray alien appeared. He then floated up into the craft where he had a telepathic 
          conversation with the grays and was given a tour of the craft before being returned. 
          After the encounter, he reports being followed by men in black.</p>

          <p><b>AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF LOVE</b>. On the <b>night of December 15, 2012</b>, Cheryl 
          was asleep in her home in Auburn, Alabama when she had an unusual dream (she thought) of 
          being called outside where she was greeted by three human-looking figures and taken into 
          a craft. They proceeded to hold a long philosophical conversation with her. The next 
          thing she knew, it was morning. She assumed the experience must have been a dream until 
          she found a mysterious circle of crushed vegetation in her yard.</p>

          <p><b>I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WALL</b>. On the <b>night of June 5, 2015</b>, Dylan woke 
          up in the bedroom of his home in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, sensing an intruder. He became 
          paralyzed and was levitated off his bed and through the wall, waking up inside a craft. 
          He lay on a table and was being examined by a gray alien. He asked to go home, and another 
          gray appeared. Then a third gray appeared, along with a hybrid child who had a strange 
          message for him. The next thing Dylan knew, it was morning, and he had a strange mark on 
          his body.</p>

          <p>Onboard UFO encounters are far more common than previously believed. There are now tens 
          of thousands of cases on record, but there are indications they might number in the millions. 
          It’s time that cases like these are taken seriously..</p>

          <h5>Oct 10, 2025 (1:01:57)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A face-to-face encounter with an unknown humanoid creature 
          is often a very terrifying experience, one that changes the way a person thinks about 
          the universe and their place in it. A direct confrontation with the unknown strikes at 
          the very core of a person’s belief system, challenging them mentally, emotionally and 
          spiritually. This video presents ten exceptionally scary UFO encounters from all over 
          the world. Most of these cases involve multiple witnesses. They include a wide variety 
          of beings, including gray aliens, human-looking figures, ape-like figures and other 
          unusual humanoids.</p>
 
          <p><b>SOCK-SNATCHING ETS</b>. One <b>morning in August 1930</b>, a woman was doing her 
          laundry in a small stream outside of Montebenichi, Italy when an extraterrestrial craft 
          landed a short distance away. She froze in fear as two strange beings emerged and 
          approached her. The two creatures walked around her making odd chirping noises. Without 
          warning, they grabbed the socks she had hung up on a clothesline to dry and ran back into 
          their craft.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MEN IN THE CLOVER FIELD</b>. One <b>summer morning in 1950</b>, a 6-year-
          old girl felt a compulsion to go outside her home in Liiduvere, Estonia. As she stood in a 
          field, she saw an oval-shaped craft sitting on the ground. Four red-skinned humanoids in 
          green jumpsuits stood next to the craft. Two of the beings approached her and telepathically 
          communicated with her. The witness fled in fear.</p>

          <p><b>THEY LOOKED HUMAN</b>. One <b>day in the Summer of 1956</b>, two couples were driving 
          on a country road outside of Marseille, France when they came upon a large craft hovering by 
          the road. They exited the car and stared in wonder as three human-looking men wearing jumpsuits 
          stared down at them, studying them as if they were animals in a zoo. Moments later, the craft 
          flew away silently at high speed.</p>

          <p><b>I PLAYED DEAD</b>. One <b>evening in June 1957</b>, James (age 6) woke up in the bedroom 
          of his home in Birmingham, Michigan to hear his younger brother Mickey whimpering in fear. He 
          knew there was something in the room, but he was too afraid to look. His fear increased when 
          the mysterious being approached him and did something to his back. It was an experience that 
          affected him years to come, but he never talked about it until years later, when he discovered 
          his brother also remembered.</p>

          <p><b>NEVER TELL THIS STORY</b>. One <b>evening in October 1968</b>, a family and their friends 
          went camping in the remote Malheur Forest of Oregon. Without warning, a massive UFO appeared 
          overhead. Humanoids could be seen looking down at them through portholes. Panic reigned as 
          everyone scattered. One witness went to get her camera, and coming out of her trailer, saw that 
          the craft was gone. To her shock, nobody remembered seeing the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>THE JETPACK HUMANOID</b>. Around dusk <b>one night in 1974</b>, Phil and his grandmother 
          were shocked when an unusual glowing object appeared and darted around the sky over their farm 
          near Melbourne, Australia. Suddenly it revealed itself as a classic flying saucer. A door opened 
          and a silver-suited humanoid appeared and began to fly around. Suddenly it landed in front of 
          Phil, who found himself paralyzed. The man flew back into his craft.</p>

          <p><b>FOUR APES AND A UFO</b>. On the <b>night of February 21, 1982</b>, two women were camping 
          in Gorliz, Spain, when an ape-like creature approached their campsite and walked off. Moments 
          later, they saw three more creatures walk quickly passed them. The witnesses cried out in fear, 
          alerting the other campers just in time to see a glowing UFO fly overhead.</p>

          <p><b>MY HEART WAS POUNDING</b>. In the middle of the <b>night on November 2, 1997</b>, Bret 
          was awakened in his bedroom in Anchorage, Alaska by a presence in his room. Unable to move 
          to first, he broke free of his paralysis to see a strange light fleeing his room. He went 
          back to sleep, only to wake up later to the sense of another presence. This time he woke up 
          to see a gray alien looking at him. He felt certain that he had almost been abducted, and 
          that the gray allowed him to see it.</p>

          <p><b>IT FROZE ME IN FEAR</b>. On the <b>night of November 9, 2010</b>, a couple decided 
          to take a walk in a grove of trees near their home in Omaha, Nebraska. Seeing shadowy 
          figures running among the trees, they approached closer and were shocked when a weird 
          humanoid stepped across their path, turned, waved and smiled, revealing a mouth full of 
          sharp teeth. They ran in fear.</p>

          <p><b>I MADE EYE CONTACT</b>. It was <b>8pm on August 5, 2017</b>, as an older couple 
          drove along a remote highway outside of Nageezi, New Mexico. To their shock, floating 
          alongside the highway was a small craft with two gray aliens sitting side by side. The 
          couple felt as though they had surprised the grays, who turned and looked at them, making 
          direct eye contact. Moments later, the craft disappeared.</p>

          <p>Ten humanoid encounters, each adding to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. There can 
          be no doubt that people are seeing strange beings. There are too many cases to explain 
          away. We are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Oct 3, 2025 (1:20:04)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most 
          fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO 
          landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, 
          Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five 
          decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness 
          cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, 
          animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological 
          reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from 
          apparent men in black.</p>

          <p><b>JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL</b>: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-
          pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful 
          ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, 
          they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance 
          as they begin playing like small children.</p>

          <p><b>AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA</b>: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing 
          noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped 
          like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green 
          jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.</p>

          <p><b>JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA</b>: When their car gets stuck in the 
          sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita 
          Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. 
          Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid 
          emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue 
          Book arrive to investigate.</p>

          <p><b>AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE</b>: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his 
          little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge 
          glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach 
          for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one 
          by one back into the craft.</p>

          <p><b>FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND</b>: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko 
          Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 
          4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the 
          craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will 
          regret for a long time.</p>

          <p><b>NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND</b>: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend 
          Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from 
          the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When 
          they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking 
          out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and 
          stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.</p>

          <p><b>MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND</b>: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-
          years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the 
          woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a 
          tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the 
          girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get 
          home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.</p>

          <p><b>SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY</b>: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti 
          only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise 
          and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-
          tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins 
          to work on apparently repairing his craft.</p>

          <p><b>NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN</b>: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar 
          River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, 
          they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking 
          towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-
          traces are found.</p>

          <p><b>JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY</b>: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning 
          coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed 
          UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her 
          binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching 
          the whole thing from his house.</p>

          <p>There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! 
          We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.</p>

          <h5>Sep 26, 2025 (1:08:55)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Strange humanoids have been visiting our planet for a very 
          long time. Although the mainstream scientific community has been slow to accept the 
          veracity of such accounts, there are now so many cases that they have become impossible 
          to ignore or explain away. This video presents ten lesser-known cases involving a 
          variety of ET types. These cases show how shocking it can be to have an experience 
          like this, and how it affects a person for the rest of their lives. With so many 
          people reporting humanoid encounters, it is time to take them seriously and learn 
          all we can about these mysterious visitors to our planet.</p>

          <p><b>I WILL REMEMBER THIS EVENT UNTIL THE DAY I DIE</b>. One <b>morning in 1946</b>, 
            Will (age 7) was in the basement of his aunt’s home in Cheviot, Ohio, when he sensed 
            a presence. Turning around he found himself face-to-face with a short gray alien 
            looking directly at him. A staring contest ensued, until Will became scared and 
            fled the scene. It took him 60 years to find the courage to report his encounter.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS SO FRIGHTENED</b>. On the <b>afternoon of December 9, 1954</b>, Olmiro da 
            Costa was feeding his sheep and cows when a strange craft appeared over his farm in 
            Linha, Bela Vista, Brazil. Three human-looking ETs emerged. At first frightened, one 
            of the figures approached him and smiled, which reassured Olmiro. The ETs took some 
            of his plants and re-entered their craft. This was one of many other humanoid 
            encounters in this area at that time.</p>

          <p><b>I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THEM</b>. One <b>night in 1967</b>, two boys were 
            playing outside their apartment home in Turku, Finland. Hearing a strange sound, 
            they were suddenly approached by two unusual-looking humanoid figures glowing with 
            green light. The two men shuffled towards the boys in such an odd manner, the boys 
            realized they were not normal humans and ran away.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS AT THE CAR RACE</b>. On the <b>night of July 4, 1969</b>, a young woman 
            was sitting in the bleachers with a crowd of other people at the Automemories 
            Speedway in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Looking up, she saw an oval-shaped craft with 
            a big window, and group of humanoids looking down and watching the race. In utter 
            disbelief, the witness looked away and when she looked back, the UFO was gone.</b>

          <p><b>THREE ALIENS IN DOWNTOWN GRAFTON</b>. One <b>day in May 1972</b>, a couple was 
            window shopping in downtown Grafton, NSW, Australia when they saw three strange 
            figures on the sidewalk. The figures were 3 feet tall, with rough brown skin, 
            pointed ears and were wearing strange clothes. The couple was shocked and after 
            examining the figures, realized that they could not be human.</b>

          <p><b>FASCINATING AND BEAUTIFUL</b>. One <b>night in October 1989</b>, Susanna and 
            her father sat in her bedroom in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Her father had his back 
            to the window. Susanna looked up and saw a gray alien staring back at her. She had 
            no idea what it was, but knew it wasn’t human. Frozen in fear, she couldn’t alert 
            her dad. The ET quickly moved off. She told her father, but he said she must have 
            seen an animal.</p>

          <p><b>I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF SANTA’S ELVES</b>. On <b>December 24, 1997</b>, Bonnie (age 
            5) crept out of the bedroom into the living room of her home in Athens, Alabama, to get 
            a drink of water. To her shock, an alien was in her home. She’d never heard of aliens 
            and thought it was an elf bringing her presents. She felt no fear but suddenly blacked 
            out and woke up in bed.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE BARN</b>. One <b>night in October 1999</b>, Kyle (age 9) noticed that 
            the cows on his dairy farm in Roy, Washington were acting up. Going out to investigate, he 
            came face-to-face with a short gray alien staring right at him. After a few moments, he 
            became scared and ran off. It was an encounter that he would never forget.</p>

          <p><b>IT MADE OUR JAWS DROP</b>. The town of Cachi, Argentina has a long rich history of 
            UFO encounters. In <b>2003</b>, activity ramped up and residents began to capture photos 
            of the craft. On <b>December 16, 2003</b>, eight people drove outside of town when a craft 
            landed in the distance. One of the witnesses approached and saw many glowing humanoid figures. 
            This was one of several humanoid cases and other dramatic encounters.</p>

          <p><b>I FULLY BELIEVE IN ALIENS</b>. On the <b>night of October 28, 2010</b>, a woman woke up 
            in her home in Mount Troy, Pennsylvania to see several gray ETs around her bed. Immobilized, 
            she watched in shock as the room filled with light and her boyfriend levitated off the bed. 
            She managed to throw her body on top of his, but he still rose upwards. The room filled with 
            light, and she blacked out.</p>

          <p>So many cases, so many witnesses, so many different types of humanoids…the face-to-face 
            humanoid accounts represent the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. They have much to teach 
            us about extraterrestrial contact and life beyond Earth. Our governments are spending an 
            enormous amount of time, energy and money to coverup the truth of this subject. It’s time 
            all humanity accepts the truth: we are being visited by aliens from other worlds.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Firsthand face-to-face encounters with humanoid extraterrestrials 
          are far more common than you might think. Cases like these have been reported for more 
          than 100 years. They come from all over the world and involve a huge variety of 
          extraterrestrials. The striking similarities between cases widely separated geographically 
          and chronologically argue strongly for their veracity. Interestingly, many cases also 
          contain rare or unique details of high strangeness, which reveal that we still have much 
          to much to learn about extraterrestrial contact. This video presents ten little known 
          cases that show these patterns, each containing fascinating insights with volumes to 
          teach us about the alien agenda.</p>

          <p><b>EIGHT-FOOT-TALL ALIENS</b>. On <b>August 7, 1954</b>, two brothers were picking 
          peas on their family farm in Saint Bernard de Lacolle, Canada, when a glowing spherical-
          shaped craft appeared and hovered overhead. Three 8-foot-tall humanoids emerged. The boys 
          ran home and alerted their family, who saw the UFO, as did several neighbors. Later 
          strange landing traces were found.</p>

          <p><b>THAT UFO WAS LOOKING FOR ME</b>. One <b>evening in November 1966</b>, three people 
          observed strange lights over their home in rural Medford, Oregon. The next night, the 
          8-year-old son went outside and was shocked to see a 4-foot-tall dressed in sparkling 
          blue clothes. As he fled in panic, the being spoke sweetly to him telepathically. Nobody 
          believed him, but later, the UFOs would return.</p>

          <p><b>IT WAS NOT A MONSTER</b>. One <b>afternoon in January 1967</b>, an anonymous engineer 
          was walking in the woods near Riachuelo, Chile, when he saw an odd light through the trees. 
          Approaching, he was shocked to see a saucer-shaped craft hovering in a clearing. Moments 
          later, a strange-looking man appeared. He had white skin, long white hair and wore a 
          transparent white uniform. He re-entered the craft which left quickly.</p>

          <p><b>HE LOOKED DIRECTLY INTO MY EYES</b>. On the <b>night of August 18, 1971</b>, Jonah 
          was camping in the forests of Carmel Valley, California, when a gray alien entered his 
          campsite. It approached the witness and established a telepathic connection. It then 
          placed an object beneath a log and left. Later, the witness retrieved the object which 
          turned out to be a book.</p>

          <p><b>WE CLUNG TO ONE ANOTHER WITH FEAR</b>. On the <b>night of August 18, 1978</b>, two 
          young brothers were driving near Harvey, Michigan. Suddenly a craft appeared overhead, and 
          looking out at them from a window in the craft were two humanoids. Terrified, the two boys 
          fled the scene. Arriving home, they reported the sighting to the local Air Force base. 
          Shortly later, the UFO returned over their home.</p>

          <p><b>IT RETURNED EIGHT TIMES</b>. One <b>evening in August 1978</b>, the Martinhos family 
          of Fuseta, Portugal, were shocked by the appearance of a sphere-shaped craft hovering right 
          over their home. Over the next two months, the craft returned at least eight times. On one 
          occasion, it landed, and humanoids emerged. Later, it hovered next to the neighbor’s home. 
          A lady looked inside and saw two aliens.</p>

          <p><b>FATHER AND SON ALIENS</b>. Looking outside his living room on the <b>night of August 
          6, 1980</b>, Matthew saw strange lights outside his home in rural Mauston, Wisconsin. 
          Stepping outside to investigate, he saw a massive craft hovering overhead. To his amazement, 
          two humanoid figures were looking down at him. As they moved off, Matthew had the impression 
          that the two ETs were father and son.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING ALMOST DIVINE</b>. One <b>night in August 1993</b>, Carol was 7 years old 
          and enjoying a party with family and friend outside their home in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. 
          Suddenly a huge craft appeared overhead, Looking down through one of the windows was a 
          humanoid figure. Most of the group ran away in terror, but Carol and her mother watched 
          in fascination, with a strong sense that the ETs were friendly.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING VAGUELY HUMAN</b>. At <b>2am one night in June 2001</b>, two friends 
          drove along a remote road in rural Ballard County, Kentucky. Suddenly their headlights 
          illuminated a strange pale-skinned creature crawling in a ditch by the road. They stopped 
          and it stood up to reveal itself as a gray alien. They took off in fear, and the gray 
          began to chase their car down the road.</p>

          <p><b>I COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING</b>. On <b>June 15, 2022</b>, Jeff stepped 
          outside his home in Albemarle, North Carolina, to smoke a cigarette and walk his dog. 
          Suddenly a strangely shaped craft appeared in the daylight sky. He called out his 
          girlfriend and both watched it move off. The next night, the girlfriend stepped outside 
          and was confronted by a short humanoid figure with large dark eyes.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, each taking us on a journey deep into the heart of the UFO phenomenon, each 
          revealing what it’s like to have a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid, each with 
          something to teach us about life beyond Earth. These cases are the tip of the iceberg. 
          There are countless other cases, showing us undeniably that humans are not the only 
          intelligent life in this universe.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The extraterrestrial presence on our planet has reached a 
          point of undeniability. The vast number of reports of metallic craft and humanoids 
          speak for themselves. In the past 100 years alone, there have been millions of documented 
          cases coming from across the world. This video presents ten firsthand accounts involving 
          close-up encounters with humanoids of many different kinds. The humanoid cases represent 
          the heart of the UFO phenomenon. Most researchers agree that they represent a superior 
          intelligence and a more advanced technology than that of humans. For these reasons alone, 
          these cases are of tremendous importance to all humanity.</p>

          <p><b>A TRIP TO UNKNOWN PLACES</b>. <b>December 9, 1954</b>, farmer Giovanni Aquilante of 
          Gricignano D’Aversa, Italy went missing. Two days later, he reappeared with an incredible 
          story to tell. He said he had encountered two small humanoids who had lifted him into the 
          sky. He couldn’t remember much of what happened to him and came back confused and 
          traumatized. He was also healed of a serious bone disease.</p>

          <p><b>TWO BEINGS APPROACHED US</b>. On the <b>night of July 10, 1965</b>, a couple was 
          motorbiking in the forests outside of Ganserndorf, Austria when a large disc-shaped craft 
          hovered overhead and landed in a nearby field. They approached on their bike, but the engine 
          failed. Walking on foot, they were shocked to see two tall humanoids in uniforms observing 
          them. Shortly later, the ETs returned to their craft and flew away.</p>

          <p><b>LITTLE MEN OF GREAT LEARNING</b>. On <b>September 10, 1965</b>, Antonio da Silva was 
          in his farm fields in Pau Ferro. Brazil when two small silver discs landed nearby. Two little 
          men about 3 feet tall emerged and approached Antonio, speaking a foreign language. Antonio 
          was terrified but said that the men seemed very friendly. After a short meeting, the little 
          men returned to their craft and departed the area.</p>

          <p><b>THE SING-SONG ALIENS</b>. On <b>July 17, 1967</b>, a group of young children were 
          playing in the fields outside the small town of Arc-Sous-Cicon, France. One of the little 
          girls was shocked to encounter four little men in black suits. She ran off. Soon another 
          witness saw and heard the beings. Afterwards, strange marks were found in the field and 
          over the next two nights, a wave of UFO sightings hit the area.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY</b>. On the <b>night of September 25, 1967</b>, 
          a young, engaged couple was driving through the hills outside of Sant Feliu de Codines, 
          Spain when their headlights illuminated a strange figure in the road. They described it 
          as short, fat, green, with long arms and thick legs. It walked directly in front of 
          their vehicle, so close they almost struck it. The couple drove off in fear.</p>

          <p><b>I THINK THEY TRIED TO TAKE ME</b>. On the <b>night of March 17, 1986</b>, farmer 
          Rito Melgarejo  was walking home in Santa Ana, Argentina when a flying saucer hovered 
          and then landed in front of him. He was paralyzed in fear as two small humanoids in 
          jumpsuits emerged. They spoke a strange language and used hand signals to persuade 
          Rito to come onboard the craft. Terrified, Rito turned and ran.</p>

          <p><b>DO YOU BELIEVE IN ALIENS?</b> One <b>night in Fall 2008</b>, Valerie woke up in her 
          home in Breezewood, Pennsylvania to see a strange praying mantis reptilian humanoid 
          standing by her bed. She was unable to move as the being told her telepathically that 
          it wanted to borrow something from her and promised to return it. Valerie protested. 
          Moments later, it departed, leaving Valerie with a strange mystery.</p>

          <p><b>YOU WILL KNOW IN TIME</b>. Late on the <b>night of August 24, 2013</b>, Shawn was 
          alone at Lake Arcadia in Edmond, Oklahoma, when he saw a strange glowing object moving 
          underwater in the lake. Suddenly it shot out of the water. He soon saw a huge craft 
          hovering nearby. Moments later, three tall human-like ETs appeared, and one of them had 
          a message for him. Shawn had missing time and woke up two hours later.</p>

          <p><b>I NEVER ONCE FELT AFRAID</b>. One <b>night in Summer 2020</b>, two young men saw a 
          strange craft over Laramie, Wyoming. A few weeks later, one of the men was in his bedroom 
          when a strange paralysis gripped him. Coming through the ceiling he saw three grays. One 
          of them connected with him telepathically, providing a download of information, leaving 
          the witness with more questions than answers.</p>

          <p><b>THE STRANGEST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD</b>. On the <b>night of November 24, 2024</b>, 
          Oscar stepped out of a rented home in Monterrey Nuevo Leon, Mexico to get some air. A 
          strange man approached. Oscar was shocked to see that the man had unusually large eyes, 
          no visible ears and extra-long fingers. When the man began to communicate telepathically, 
          he realized that the man was probably not human.</p>

          <p>These ten cases share remarkable similarities that appear consistently in humanoid 
          reports. They also show unique details of high strangeness that raise many questions 
          about extraterrestrial contact. Only by continuing research will we come to a consensus 
          about the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          SEVEN AMAZING<br>
          ONBOARD<br>
          UFO ENCOUNTERS</a></h2>

          <h5>Sep 5, 2025 (1:06:22)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Onboard UFO encounters are perhaps the most extensive and 
          interesting of all UFO experiences. They are also the most controversial. Skeptics try 
          to explain these reports as the results of hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions or 
          mental illness. But an objective examination of the reports refutes these explanations. 
          The fact is, cases like these have occurred for over 100 years, come from across the 
          planet, and are reported by a wide variety of people. There is a reason these visitors 
          are coming to our planet, and as the onboard cases show, the reason is us! This video 
          presents seven little known onboard UFO encounters, each adding another piece of the 
          puzzle toward solving the UFO mystery.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS COMPLETELY PARALYZED</b>. On <b>November 2, 1954</b>, Maurilio Braga Godoi 
          was walking to his home in Santo Amaro, Brazil, and came upon a landed UFO. He wanted 
          to run but felt himself drawn inside it. He saw a glowing map on a weird table. He was 
          met by three short humanoids with dark skin and dark hair, wearing gray jumpsuits, who 
          were interested in examining him. He was taken on a tour over South America and was given 
          a strange liquid to drink before being returned. The case was investigated by the Brazilian 
          military who classified it as unknown.</p>
          
          <p><b>I WAS SO SCARED</b>. Gerardo Scharff had an abusive childhood and was used as a 
          slave by a ruthless dairy farmer in Villa Maria, Argentina. He prayed nightly for help. 
          One <b>night in May 1966</b>, at age 12, a strange craft landed, and tall beings brought 
          him onboard. They asked him about his life and gave him a tour of the craft. He was taken 
          into space and shown the solar system. He was taken to another planet and shown an alien 
          city. He was examined, fed a strange liquid, given prophecies of future events, and then 
          returned. The ETs soon visited him again, providing food and helping to free him from his 
          abusive situation.</p>
          
          <p><b>THEY WERE FRIENDLY</b>. One <b>morning in July 1974</b>, three teenage boys from 
          Fairview, NJ, were walking home after playing basketball when a UFO appeared overhead. 
          Suddenly, they found themselves inside. One of the witnesses saw his two friends being 
          examined by gray aliens, who spoke with him telepathically. He believes they were helping 
          his friends with their heart conditions. He counted about 25 grays. Looking out a porthole, 
          he saw his hometown below him. Suddenly, all three were returned, and he watched the craft 
          depart. His two friends had missing time, and had no memory of being onboard.</p>

          <p><b>THEY ONLY WANTED TO HELP ME</b>. On the <b>night of February 28, 1984</b>, Tom Fraser 
          had a horrific motorbike accident in Guildford, England. Moments before hitting the ground, 
          he saw a glowing light in the sky. In the seconds following the accident, he himself badly 
          injured, lying on a table onboard a UFO. Gray ETs promised to heal him and said they had a 
          mission for him. Tom was healed, and given a tour of the craft. His next memory was of 
          waking up in a hospital with only a broken arm, which shocked the doctors as they thought 
          he should be much more severely injured.</p>

          <p><b>WE’RE JUST CURIOUS</b>. On the <b>night of October 13, 1994</b>, a college student 
          was asleep in her dorm-room in Buffalo, NY, when she woke up being levitated out of her 
          room. Seconds later, she found herself on a metal table, unable to move, being examined 
          by gray aliens. They communicated with her telepathically, reassuring her that they meant 
          no harm. Suddenly she awoke back in her room. She later found a strange mark on her lower 
          back.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS EXTREMELY SCARED</b>. On the <b>night of June 16, 2002</b>, two 9-year-old 
          cousins were taking a walk near their home in Blanchard, OK when they felt a weird 
          vibration, followed by a strange darkness. A loud whooshing sound came next and suddenly 
          they saw a large craft hover and land next to them. Three grays appeared and pulled them 
          onboard the craft and examined them. One of them also saw a human-looking figure onboard. 
          He also saw a tub of black liquid, before being returned. They found out that their parents 
          had been searching for them for over an hour.</p>

          <p><b>IT GOT EXTREMELY BIZARRE</b>. One <b>night in October 2010</b>, Frank woke up to 
          find himself on the balcony of his apartment in Harleysville, PA. Directly overhead was 
          a large craft. He felt himself floating upwards. Moments later, he was inside the craft. 
          He was unable to focus his eyes, but recalls being physically examined by humanoid beings, 
          and then suddenly waking up sitting, up in bed. After another later encounter, he decided 
          that it was time to seek help.</p>

          <p>These seven cases represent the tip of the iceberg. None of these witnesses needed 
          hypnosis to recall their encounters. None of them are seeking attention. This sort of 
          experience is far more common than most people believe. It represents the very heart of 
          the UFO phenomenon. And it also has the potential to answer the many questions 
          surrounding extraterrestrial contact. For that reason alone, these cases should be 
          taken seriously.</p>

          <h5>Aug 29, 2025 (1:15:12)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Cases of strange humanoids come from all over the world. They 
          have been reported by a wide variety of people for over 100 years. The huge number of 
          cases represents the best evidence that something very profound is happening here. The 
          video presents 10 cases, each of which shares remarkable commonalities but also have 
          unique details of high strangeness. These cases have volumes to teach us about the 
          extraterrestrial presence on our planet, such as who these beings are, where they come 
          from and why they are here.</p>

          <p><b>I BEHELD AN INCREDIBLE THING</b>. Security guard Francesco Rizzi never believed 
          in UFOs,  but at <b>2:20 am on December 17, 1962</b>, he changed his mind. He was guarding 
          a textile plant in the heart of Milan, Italy, when a craft dropped from the sky and 
          hovered mere feet above the ground. A short humanoid emerged and began to make weird 
          hand signals for Francesco to approach. A second humanoid appeared calling the first 
          one back inside, and the craft took off.</p>

          <p><b>A NICE LITTLE MAN</b>. Throughout <b>October and November of 1965</b>, a massive UFO 
          wave struck the city of Mogi-Guacu, in Sao Paolo, Brazil. There were thousands of witnesses, 
          but only a few saw humanoids such as one farm family who seemed to be a target when craft 
          landed at least twice on their farm, humanoids came out and gathered samples from the ground. 
          It was one of many other humanoid cases in the area.</p>

          <p><b>I WILL DENY IT</b>. One <b>night in October 1968</b>, a pastor and three female high-
          school students drove along a remote road near Hastings, North Dakota when a UFO began to 
          pace their car. The two girls in the backseat watched excitedly as they saw short gray 
          humanoids looking down at them. Strangely, the pastor and the girl in front refused to even 
          look. The UFO followed them for several miles then quickly darted off.</p>

          <p><b>NO SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION</b>. On the <b>night of October 1, 1975</b>, two young 
          men from Hakushu, Japan took a drive into the foothills of the southern Alps. Right after 
          parking their car in an empty parking lot, one of the men saw strange humanoids around 
          the car. Suddenly the car was drawn backwards several times. They drove off in fear. 
          They returned later and the same thing happened again.</p>

          <p><b>DON’T BE SCARED</b>. At age 7, David woke up in the bedroom of his home in Plattsmouth, 
          Nebraska to see a gray alien staring at him. It told him, ‘Don’t be scared, turn around,” 
          which he did. When he looked back, the gray was gone. He woke up his brother who slept in 
          the same room, and moments later, they saw the gray again peeking into the doorway.</p>

          <p><b>DID YOU SEE WHAT I JUST SAW?</b> One <b>morning in May 1976</b>, two men were driving 
          along a road just outside of Valdez, Alaska, when they saw a UFO landed in the field right 
          along the highway. To their amazement, a ramp opened up and two gray ETs emerged. They 
          seemed to be in a hurry. The men drove on but immediately turned around. When they returned, 
          the craft was gone.</p>

          <p><b>NOT OF THIS WORLD</b>. On the <b>night of July 25, 1982</b>, world-famous bullfighter, 
          Rafale Peralta was driving near Punta Umbria, Spain, when he noticed strange lights along 
          the beach. He stopped his car and went to investigate. To his shock, he came upon a landed 
          UFO and a 7-foot-tall silver-suited humanoid. The being tried to speak, but when Rafael 
          answered, the being returned to the craft and departed.</p>

          <p><b>I CONTINUE TO WONDER</b>. On the <b>night of October 27, 2010</b>, Carlos woke up in 
          his apartment in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to see a UFO hovering outside his window. Suddenly 
          he sensed grays in his apartment and felt like he was put to sleep. Later, he awoke and saw 
          one of the grays staring at him through the window and then was put to sleep again. He awoke 
          again just in time to watch the UFO depart.</p>

          <p><b>A CREATURE IN OUR HOME</b>. On <b>October 22, 2015</b>, Emma (of New York State) 
          dreamed that she saw a gray alien crouching under her dining room table. Suddenly she was 
          waking up in bed to a loud crashing noise. Her husband leaped out of bed and into the 
          dining room to see that a small table had broken and spilled its contents. Their burglar 
          alarm was malfunctioning, and they both saw strange orbs outside.</p>

          <p><b>I FELT I WAS BEING TAGGED</b>. It was <b>October 6, 2023</b>, and struggling from a 
          recent divorce, Chris took a drive near his home in Olympia, Washington, to vent his emotion. 
          Stopping his car over a bridge, he screamed. At that moment, he felt electricity jolt through 
          him and looked up, saw two craft with three gray ETs looking down at him. He felt a telepathic 
          link as they suddenly flew off, but since then, continues to feel that they are observing him.</p>

          <p>A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid being is one of the most life-changing experiences 
          a person can have. Only a person who has had this experience can truly understand how 
          transformative it is. There are now many thousands of documented cases, and some researchers 
          believe they may number in the millions. There are too many cases to deny or explain away. We 
          are being visited!</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Aug 22, 2025 (1:40:01)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On the <b>evening of September 14, 1978</b>, Susan Ware (an artist 
          and former 3rd Class Petty Officer in the US Navy) and her friend Karen drove along 
          a remote highway in the deserts of central Utah. It was a beautiful night as the moon 
          rose, and the stars shone brightly in the clear night sky. But suddenly, things changed. 
          An eerie darkness settled over the area, blotting out their view of the sky above. Then, 
          without warning, Karen, (who was driving) slammed on the brakes and came to a stop. Ahead 
          of them on the highway, they saw something astonishing. A group of twenty oversized 
          jackrabbits were blocking the road. The rabbits stood unmoving, like sentries, their 
          backs facing the vehicle. The astonished women exited the car and stared with disbelief. 
          The jackrabbits were far too large to be normal, and their lack of movement betrayed the 
          fact that something very odd was happening here.</p>

          <p>Susan and Karen walked to the front of the car and reached out to hold each other’s hand. 
          At that moment, the lights in the vehicle turned off, the radio which had been playing 
          became silent, a blinding light shone down on them from above, and all the rabbits turned 
          around in one smooth, synchronized movement. Susan screamed. The rabbits were no longer 
          rabbits: they were gray aliens!</p>

          <p>The next thing Susan and Karen knew, it was morning, nine hours had passed, and they 
          were in a small diner in Grand Junction, Colorado, hundreds of miles away from their 
          original location. Both women stared around them in astonishment. Susan’s mind instantly 
          went back to the last thing she remembered: the car stopping, the rabbits turning around, 
          the gray aliens, the bright light coming from above. At the same time, she began having 
          flashbacks of being in a strange room, seeing gray ETs looking at her, and falling 
          through the sky high above the Earth. Karen, however, could only remember starting the 
          drive earlier that evening. She didn’t remember anything about the encounter itself. Both 
          women had no idea how they got to the diner. And both felt physically ill with burns on 
          their skin, a raging thirst, nausea and more.</p>

          <p>Unable to understand and process the experience, both women moved on with their lives. 
          As Susan recovered, she remembered that as a child, she had several encounters with 
          strange humanoids looking in through the window of her home. Joining the Navy as a 
          young woman, she had several UFO sightings. Once while camping with friends in the 
          desert, she had an astonishing close-up sighting.</p>

          <p>For decades, she did her best to forget about her strange experiences, particularly 
          the encounter on the desert highway. She got married, had children and did her best to 
          live a normal life. But throughout the years, she continued to have experiences with 
          high strangeness: seeing a spirit, having psychic visions, powerful intuitions and 
          synchronicities, remote viewing, even a couple of Bigfoot encounters. But always, in 
          the back of her mind, was the encounter on the desert highway. What happened that night? 
          What had occurred during those nine hours of missing time?</p>

          <p>Finally, the time came when Susan realized it was time to figure things out. Her 
          children had grown up. She was  separated from her husband. She no longer had to 
          worry about what other people might think. She went to her computer and typed in 
          the word UFO. To her amazement, the film, “Alien Abduction Answers,” by John Yost 
          had just been released that very day. This incredible synchronicity inspired her 
          to reach out to John Yost. This led to her meeting hypnotherapist Debz Shakti.</p>

          <p>Under hypnosis, Susan recalled being pulled onboard a craft along with her friend 
          Karen. She found herself in a small room with soft blue walls. A small gray stood 
          next to her. Susan asked if she could touch the being, and it said yes. It then 
          proceeded to show her images of war: tanks on the streets, explosions, people 
          starving and more. The gray warned her that Susan had to do her best to warn the 
          world about the dangers of human aggression. She was physically examined, and she 
          believes she may have been healed. Both women were returned to Earth.</p>

          <p>Going under hypnosis turned out to be a turning point in Susan’s life. She overcame 
          the fear of her encounter and finally had answers about what happened. She sought 
          the help of researchers like Richard Banasiak and Earl Grey of MUFON. Susan’s case 
          garnered a lot of attention and was voted as MUFON’s best case of the year for 2023.</p>

          <h5>Aug 15, 2025 (1:00:59)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature is one 
          of the most shocking and mindboggling experiences a person can have. And it happens 
          more often than you might think. There are many thousands of documented cases. Most 
          people who have these kinds of encounters rarely report it to UFO groups, so the 
          actual number is likely much higher.</p>

          <p>These cases have been occurring for at least a hundred years and probably much longer. 
          They occur all over the world to all kinds of people. This episode presents six 
          particularly unusual cases. In each of these cases, the witnesses not only held 
          conversations with the ETs, but they were given information that impacted them for the 
          rest of their lives.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN PLAN</b>. One <b>evening in April 1962</b>, five-year-old Worthington 
          White woke up in his grandmother’s home in Quantico, Virginia to see light flooding into 
          his bedroom through the attic door. He noticed three short child-like figures standing 
          in the room. One of them approached and began to communicate telepathically, downloading 
          information into his brain.</p>

          <p>The next morning, he knew his life would never be the same. In fact, he had incredibly 
          ambitious goals and a whole new plan for his life. Growing up, he faced many challenges, 
          but the advice given to him by the ETs appeared in his mind and helped chart the course 
          of his life, eventually putting him in an incredibly influential career at the very top 
          of the US government.</p>
          
          <p><b>A GRAY SAT NEXT TO ME</b>. One <b>night in June 1963</b>, seventeen-year-old 
          Victor was driving along a remote road in Deptford, New Jersey. Without warning, his 
          headlights failed, his car engine quit, and he rolled to a stop. A sudden inexplicable 
          and overwhelming fear swept through him and he realized someone was sitting next to him 
          in his car. Looking over, he was shocked to see a short gray alien. It looked at him 
          with such peace that he became instantly calm. In then communicating him with 
          telepathically, filling his mind with volumes of information. It then disappeared, but 
          from that point on, Victor slowly discovered that the gray had taught him many things.</p>

          <p><b>THE RAINBOW MAN</b>. One <b>afternoon in summer 1974</b>, two brothers, Thomas 
          (age 5) and Kevin (age 4) from Needmore, Pennsylvania, noticed a hippy-looking man sit 
          down in their backyard. The man began to communicate to them telepathically. Both boys 
          noticed the man had a visible aura filled with rainbow colors. The man shared knowledge 
          with them about themselves and the universe, taking them on an interactive journey into 
          some of Earth’s natural wonders, and teaching them both about their past, present and 
          future life. Both were deeply impacted by the encounter and found that the knowledge 
          the man shared with them helped to guide them throughout their adult life.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS SO SCARED, I STARTED TO CRY</b>. One <b>night in summer 1988</b>, a young boy, 
          Jose de Diego Vazquez, was walking through the Yunque Rain Forest in Puerto Rico as part 
          of a survival training course. Strange lights flew overhead and landed behind a large 
          rock. Jose was petrified with fear when a male humanoid stepped out and began to speak 
          with him, telling him not to be afraid. The figure then used strange symbols to share 
          astounding information with the young boy. The man disappeared, and Jose ran back to 
          camp only to be faced with a strange mystery. No time had passed during the entire 
          encounter!</p>

          <p><b>THE BLOOD OF THE KINGS</b>. On the <b>night of January 10, 2010</b>, a man heard a 
          strange knocking sound on his back door in Toledo Ohio. Going to investigate, he was met 
          by a short gray alien. The man invited the gray inside, at which point, a long conversation 
          followed. The gray said they had observed the man since childhood, that they were very 
          interested in his genetics, and then proceeded to answer all the witness’s questions, 
          even allowing the witness to touch the ET. The ET had some questions of his own. It was 
          an encounter that would change the witness’s life.</p>

          <p><b>THE HARVESTERS OF MEMORIES</b>. Ever since he was a young boy, Christopher, a boy from 
          South Dakota, had been visited by gray ETs. Usually they stood by his bed and seemed to study 
          him. The visits occurred at least twice a year, but doubled when Christopher (who was 
          being treated for Aspergers and depression) decided to stop taking prescription medicine. 
          Christopher suddenly excelled physically, mentally and creatively. Then, on the <b>night 
          of February 26, 2015</b>, he was visited by an 8-foot-tall elder gray who spoke to him 
          telepathically, sharing incredible volumes of information about the ETs and their 
          mission on Earth, and explained exactly why they found him to be of particular interest 
          to them.</p>

          <p>These six cases are important because they show that often an encounter with a humanoid 
          appears to be an intentional event designed to impart wisdom to an individual to help 
          guide them through their lives. They show that extraterrestrial contact can play a very 
          powerful role in a person’s life-path.</p>

          FIRSTHAND CASES</a></h2>

          <h5>Aug 8, 2025 (1:08:51)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is the closest of all UFO experiences: being taken onboard 
          a craft. Cases like these represent the frontline of research. They contain more 
          information than any other type of UFO encounter and offer the opportunity to answer 
          the many questions that surround extraterrestrial contact, such as, who are these 
          mysterious visitors to our planet, where do they come from, and why they are here.</p> 
          
          <p>While some people remain skeptical that cases like these take place, the truth is that 
          there are tens of thousands of reports, with indications that they may number in the 
          millions. This video presents five particularly extensive and lesser-known onboard 
          UFO encounters from across the world-cases which involve long interactions and 
          conversations with extraterrestrials. Most of the cases involve multiple witnesses, 
          each of who were given amazing information about the ETs and/or the future of our 
          planet.</p>

          <p><b>I HAVE NO FEAR</b>. On the <b>night of February 4, 1974</b>, a family of three was 
          camping in a remote and isolated area of the vast Sonoran Desert in Mexico. In the middle 
          of the night, they were awakened by a beeping noise but couldn’t locate the source. The 
          next morning, the mother had the impression that a UFO had visited them in the night. 
          Years passed, and they decided to explore the incident under hypnosis. Together, they 
          recalled being taken onboard the craft by gray-type ETs. The father was given harrowing 
          predictions about the future of humanity. The son recalled being shown strange alien 
          symbols. The mother could only recall being led up to the craft. All four say that the 
          strange encounter remains one of the most mysterious events of their lives.</p>

          <p><b>I HAD A ROLE TO PLAY</b>. One <b>night in June of 1975</b>, a newly engaged couple 
          were in Minong, Pennsylvania when they saw a UFO and experienced a period of missing time. 
          They alerted their family who also saw the object. They flashed a light at it, and it 
          flashed back and disappeared. Later, the couple realized that they had missing time and 
          went under hypnosis. The woman recalled being taken onboard and meeting a glowing being 
          face-to-face. He told her that the world was on the verge of catastrophe, and that she 
          had a role to play in helping humanity. The man recalled only that the ETs were concerned 
          for the world. Both say the encounter was benevolent.</p>

          <p><b>MY WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED</b>. In <b>1975</b>, Frank Johnson of 
          eastern Pennsylvania began meditating in the hopes of making contact with ETs. 
          Immediately, he and his wife Alice experienced a series of close-up sightings outside 
          their home. Then, one evening, the room lit up and the couple saw a UFO outside. The 
          went outside and were suddenly pulled onboard the craft. They saw three human-looking 
          figures in blue jumpsuits. The two were separated. The woman was given a physical exam 
          and healed of a chronic medical condition. The husband held a long telepathic 
          conversation with the ETs about astronomy, other dimensions and humanity. The two 
          were then returned to their home. Later the woman had another missing time encounter.</p>

          <p><b>OUR MISSION IS ONE OF PEACE</b>. On the <b>night of January 28, 1978</b>, a man 
          was hiking near Lago Vichuquen, Chile when a massive saucer-shaped craft appeared 
          overhead, struck him with a beam of light and pulled him into the craft. He was greeted 
          by three human-looking figures wearing tan-jumpsuits. Frightened at first, the witness 
          calmed down as the ETs explained that they just wanted to speak with him. A very long 
          conversation ensued, during which the ETs answered all the man’s questions and offered 
          volumes of information about themselves and the history and future of humanity.</p>

          <p><b>A PURE LEARNING EXPERIENCE</b>. At <b>2am on July 1, 1996</b>, two men were driving 
          near Coates, Minnesota when they heard a loud buzzing noise, and saw a glowing craft 
          alongside the road. They stopped the car. One of the witnesses exited the car to take a 
          closer look. The next thing they knew, hours had passed, they were approaching the next 
          town, and it was morning. Later one of the witnesses went under hypnosis. He recalled 
          being struck by a blue beam of light and pulled into the craft. He was greeted by two 
          grays and a human-looking man. The ETs said that they had brought him onboard to teach 
          him. The witness was shown many things and was told that he was part of their “plan” with 
          humanity.</p>

          <p>The importance of cases like these cannot be understated. The witnesses themselves 
          have been deeply changed by their experiences, and the information they have been told 
          firsthand by the ETs themselves has profound consequences for all humanity. the five 
          cases presented here are just a tiny fraction of the true number of cases. The witnesses 
          don’t have the luxury of disbelief. The question is not, are these cases taking place. 
          The evidence speaks for itself. The question is, will humanity heed the advice given by 
          the ETs?</p>

          <h5>Aug 1, 2025 (1:15:04)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown Episode Thirteen,” the 
          continuing investigative series which proves that UFOs are being seen everywhere 
          on this planet. This series was born from a challenge: name any town, city or 
          location on Earth, and I will find a UFO encounter there. And so far, 100% of the 
          locations provided have a history of UFO encounters.</p>

          <p>Today we explore five new locations, each provided by you, the viewers. These 
          locations include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Pittsburg, California; Attleboro, 
          Massachusetts; Oahu, Hawaii and Morganton, NC. These locations not only have been 
          visited by UFOs, they have produced the entire range of UFO encounters. Sightings, 
          USOs, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters and even a crash/retrieval case. Many 
          are supported by compelling evidence: landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, 
          EM disturbances, radar returns and startling photographs. This series proves beyond a 
          reasonable doubt that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

          <p><b>PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA</b>. In <b>1948</b>, military pilots saw strange objects 
          in the skies. More sightings occurred in the <b>1950s</b>, which also produced startling 
          cases of direct contact. In <b>1950</b>, a woman reports that small humanoids entered her 
          home and communicated with her telepathically. In <b>1954</b>, a girl came upon a landed 
          craft and a humanoid. In <b>1964</b>, a man was taken onboard a craft and examined. In 
          <b>1967</b>, a grade-school student had a strange encounter with a gray alien who had a 
          profound message for her. Another young girl reports she was taken onboard a craft and 
          given a medical exam by grays. In <b>1978</b>, more than 200 people observed a large craft 
          moving over the city. On <b>May 5, 1982</b>, calls flooded the local police stations from 
          people reporting UFOs. The <b>1980s</b> brought more startling encounters, including a 
          couple who saw a disc over the Birmingham Bridge, and man who collided into a UFO while 
          driving. In the years that followed, Pittsburgh produced more encounters, making it clear 
          that the city is of great interest to the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>PITTSBURG, CALIFORNIA</b>. This area has produced some very close encounters. In 
          <b>1977</b>, three boys were out hiking when a UFO landed nearby, and three strange 
          humanoids chased them for several blocks. In <b>2009</b>, a man observed a UFO so close to 
          his home, his windows vibrated from the humming sound it produced. In <b>2014</b>, a group 
          of witnesses gathered in a McDonald’s Restaurant Parking lot and observed strange craft at 
          very elevation.</p>

          <p><b>ATTLEBORO, MASSACHUSETTS</b>. In addition to many cases of anomalous lights, this 
          city has some truly amazing cases. In <b>December 1975</b>, an entire family observed a 
          spherical craft hover overhead. Some of them chased after it in their car, and they ended 
          up having missing time. In <b>1981</b>, three sisters called the police after a craft 
          swooped down from the sky and buzzed their vehicle. In <b>1986</b>, a family of four had 
          a frightening encounter with a metallic disc which hovered right in front of their car. 
          Unknown to them, numerous other people also saw the craft. In <b>2010</b>, a family saw 
          strange dome-shaped craft while driving near the home.</p>

          <p><b>OAHU, HAWAII</b>. This island has a very rich history of encounter. <b>1924</b>, 
          a young boy had a weird encounter with a humanoid on the beach. When a navy officer 
          came upon a landed UFO and humanoids in <b>1944</b>, the case resulted in an apparent 
          retrieval of the craft by the military. The <b>1950s</b> brought a flood of sightings, 
          including a massive wave directly over Barber’s Point Naval Air Station. The <b>1960s 
          and 1970s</b> brought more sightings, several more humanoid cases, including onboard 
          UFO encounters complete with profound alien messages. There were also some amazing 
          photographic cases. Activity continued with dozens of encounters, even as recent as 
          <b>2023</b>.</p>

          <p><b>MORGANTON, NORTH CAROLINA</b>. This small town has produced several amazing encounters. 
          A sighting over the North Carolina School for the Deaf involved more than a dozen witnesses. 
          In <b>1980</b>, a wave of sightings generated numerous calls to the police from concerned 
          residents describing metallic craft hovering near their homes. In <b>1981</b>, two young boys 
          had a close-up encounter with a craft that would affect them for the rest of their lives. The 
          <b>1990s</b> brought more startling sightings of solid craft. A truly odd case occurred in 
          <b>2006</b> when an inmate at the Foothills Correctional Facility reported seeing a UFO with 
          humanoids right outside his cell.</p>

          <p>This is just a summary of the many significant UFO events that have occurred in these 
          locations. Once again, the evidence is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere on 
          our planet. The obvious takeaway is UFO encounters are far more common than previously 
          believed. And when one considers that the vast majority of people do not report their 
          encounters, the actual number of cases must be mindbogglingly huge. It appears that the 
          extraterrestrials are conducting a vigorous and well-orchestrated publicity campaign to 
          announce their presence.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">One controversial aspect of extraterrestrial encounters is 
          the phenomenon known as missing time. People who have a close encounter suddenly find 
          that minutes or even hours have passed that they cannot account for. Research has shown 
          that cases of missing time are likely unremembered onboard experiences. This feature is 
          very common and very confusing and scary for the witness. This video presents twelve 
          amazing cases of missing time in connection with a face-to-face encounter with humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>A SENSE OF COMPLETE PEACE</b>. One <b>summer day in 1942</b>, two children from 
          Surrey, England, were taking a walk and became overcome with a feeling of utter peace. 
          Two handsome men in strange clothes approached and proceeded to impart prophecies of 
          future events. The children lost consciousness. They ran home to discover that they 
          had been missing for 24 hours.</p>

          <p><b>AN UNCONQUERABLE URGE</b>. One <b>night in November 1961</b>, a man was in his 
          beach-house in Pinhal, Brazil when a strong impulse drew him outside. He saw a glowing 
          craft sitting on the beach. Two humanoids emerged and walked up to him. The next thing 
          he knew, he was back in front of his house, missing two hours of time.</p>

          <p><b>THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY</b>. One <b>day in July 1968</b>, a group of friends hiked 
          along the Mina Rivera near Monte Britton, Puerto Rico and came upon a tall, green-
          skinned humanoid standing in the river. The friends were entranced by the sight. 
          The next thing they knew, it was dark, and four hours had passed.</p>

          <p><b>I WANTED TO STAY WITH THEM</b>. One <b>day in October 1973</b>, two brothers were 
          walked in the woods at Fall Creek Falls, Tennessee. An odd silence settled around them, 
          and one brother fled. The younger boy found himself face-to-face with three gray aliens. 
          Running back to his family, he learned that he had been missing for a full hour.</p>

          <p><b>I KNEW IT WAS A UFO</b>. On <b>July 15, 1977</b>, a mother and son watched a 
          saucer-shaped craft from the window of their home in Westchester, Pennsylvania. A window 
          in the craft revealed the presence of six humanoids. The son ran to get his telescope but 
          never made it. The next thing he knew, he and his mother were in the hallway. The craft 
          was gone. Oddly, both went to bed and never discussed it.</p>

          <p><b>A PART OF US</b>. One <b>night in November 1980</b>, a lady woke up to see a 
          glowing craft outside her farm near Todmorden, England. Suddenly, she found herself 
          outside, sitting on the ground, staring at three short humanoids. The next thing she 
          knew, she was back in bed and the UFO was leaving. The next morning, she found that 
          many of their chickens had died mysteriously.</p>

          <p><b>SOME KIND OF ALIENS</b>. On the <b>night of June 19, 1987</b>, four people drove 
          on a remote road outside Croton Falls, New York. Their car died. Three gray aliens 
          approached. One of the witnesses shone a flashlight at them and the aliens ran off 
          into the woods. Then a large craft rose up and disappeared. Driving home, they were 
          missing two hours of time.</p>

          <p><b>IT SENDS CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE</b>. On the <b>night of October 22, 1988</b>, a 
          father and son were asleep in their truck after a day of hunting in Joe Daviess County, 
          Illinois. The son woke up to a sense of being watched. He opened his eyes and saw a gray 
          alien looking at him. He found himself going outside, where he saw five gray aliens and 
          a large craft. The ETs led him to the craft, and that’s all he could remember.</p>

          <p><b>IT’S TIME TO TELL THE TRUTH</b>. On the <b>night of July 25, 1989</b>, a father 
          and son drove to their home in Catoosa, Oklahoma. A UFO appeared in front of their car. 
          Through the portholes, they saw aliens looking down at them. A blue light struck their 
          car. The son recalled seeing ETs outside the car. Both witnesses passed out and woke up 
          to see the UFO darting away. They were missing 40 minutes of time.</p>

          <p><b>A PRESENCE IN MY ROOM</b>. On the <b>night of August 17, 1994</b>, a lady was 
          woken by a bright light entering the bedroom of her home in Alabama. Four gray ETs 
          entered and floated her out of bed, down the hall and to the front door. Elaine 
          gripped the wall, but promptly passed out. When she woke up, it was morning.</p>

          <p><b>IT GOT FRIGHTENING</b>. On the <b>night of October 5, 1995</b>, a couple and 
          their son were sleeping in their camper at Red Canyon Campgrounds in the Manzano 
          Mountains of New Mexico. The wife was woken by a bright light. She woke her husband, 
          and both saw three strange humanoids outside. Suddenly it was morning. They forget 
          the entire event until several years later.</p>

          <p><b>I FLOATED UP OUT OF BED</b>. On the night of <b>October 1, 2017</b>, Chuck of 
          Vienna, Virginia was awakened by a light in the hallway. The door opened and blue-
          skinned hooded beings came in, removed his CPAP mask and floated him out of bed and 
          out of his room. He passed out. His next memory was being floated back into bed by 
          the same creatures.</p>

          <p>These cases come from all over the world, each showing this peculiar amnesia effect 
          that is present in so many cases. The question remains, why? Are the ETs doing this, or 
          does the human mind suppress these events?</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This is the true story of Janet and her lifelong experiences 
          with gray extraterrestrials. Her contacts started around age nine. But it was an 
          incredibly unusual encounter at age 10 that changed her life forever. Along with her 
          UFO/ET experiences, which include instances of missing time, added time, and at least 
          three onboard encounters, Janet, like most contactees, has also experienced many 
          paranormal events such as ghost encounters, angels, a near-death experience, 
          premonitions, mediumship and more high strangeness.</p>

          <p>In <b>1969</b>, ten-year-old Janet rode her bike with some friends along a suburban 
          street in Tarzana, California. Looking up, they saw a strange craft hover over some 
          trees at the top of a steep driveway. They raced up to get a closer look, but the craft 
          was gone. They spent the next hour pushing their bikes up the driveway and racing down, 
          then decided to go home. Janet headed up the driveway one more time so she could race 
          down and pass her friends. But reaching the top of the driveway, she saw a strange boy 
          emerge from the trees, shakily riding his bike. He wore a red shirt and jeans. As he 
          approached, she saw he had a large bald head, dark wrap-around eyes, a tiny nose and 
          mouth, gray skin and only four fingers on each hand.</p>
          
          <p>Her mind raced to figure out what she was seeing. Was he a deformed child? But when 
          the boy reached out his hand and touched her shoulder, and spoke in her mind, “Do not be 
          afraid,” Janet realized that this boy could not be human. Terror filled her. She couldn’t 
          move. Suddenly, the boy was gone. Janet raced home in fear and told her friends about the 
          “monster boy.” They did not believe her, nor did the adults she told. They asked her where 
          she had been for the last two hours. Janet wondered, how did it get so late? Janet didn’t 
          think of UFOs or aliens. She just knew that she had encountered something very strange and 
          scary.</p>

          <p>Janet’s mind went back to other recent odd events. One year earlier, she had seen a 
          strange black figure looking at her while she played with her friend. One night, she was 
          woken by a brilliant blue light filling her room. She got up to investigate, and that’s 
          all she could remember. Little did Janet know, more strange events were coming.</p>

          <p>A few years later, Janet’s family moved to another house, which turned out to be 
          badly haunted. Doors opened and closed by themselves, ghostly footsteps were heard 
          throughout the house, objects moved mysteriously or disappeared. There were cold spots, 
          apparitions, orbs and other poltergeist-like events. Finally, her mother called a 
          parapsychologist, who said that Janet was likely the cause of the strange events. Still 
          the activity continued. She met a man, married and moved out of her house. Still the 
          strange events continued.</p>

          <p>At age 21, out of the blue, Janet suffered a stroke and had an NDE. Thankfully, she 
          made a full recovery, which baffled and astonished the doctors, who could find no trace 
          of her illness. One night while driving with her husband in Canyon Country, California, 
          the car mysteriously stalled. Her husband left to get help. Janet was alone in the car 
          and became consumed with fear that someone was coming to get her. The next thing she 
          knew, hours had passed, and they were driving home. It was another instance of missing 
          time.</p>

          <p>She became pregnant and had a child. Her marriage didn’t work out, so she separated 
          and moved back home. Sadly, her mom’s health was failing rapidly, and Janet found herself 
          overwhelmed with caring for her infant daughter and her ailing mother. It was then that 
          she had a dramatic angelic encounter.</p>

          <p>As time passed, many other strange events occurred. In <b>2005</b>, she had a scary 
          UFO encounter while driving through Victorville, CA and ended up arriving home hours 
          earlier than she should have. She heard strange beeping tones in her head. She found an 
          odd metallic foreign body lodged in her cheek. Then, watching TV, she saw images of gray 
          aliens and realized with a shock that they looked just like the monster boy she saw as a 
          kid. She went under hypnosis and recalled that she was apparently taken onboard and saw 
          more grays who gave her a message she has yet to recall.</p>

          <p>Moving to Texas in <b>2016</b>, she had a dream she was taken onboard a UFO and 
          examined by gray ETs. When she woke up, she found a strange substance on her neck 
          which proved that the experience was not a dream. She soon had another event where 
          she recalled being on a craft and seeing a gray.</p>

          <p>More paranormal events followed. She had telepathic conversations with the grays 
          who helped her with her health issues. She had OBEs, premonitions, mediumship abilities 
          and more. A DNA search revealed shocking things about her ancestry. Today Janet remains 
          in telepathic communication with the grays, and is still searching for answers about 
          her strange life. To read more about Janet's experiences (and many others) check out

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The onboard UFO experience is the cutting edge of UFO 
          research. It is the closest and most extensive of all encounters and holds the 
          greatest potential to assist both contactees and researchers to better understand
          extraterrestrial contact. With tens of thousands of documented cases (and indications 
          that they number in the millions) it behooves all humanity to take these accounts 
          seriously. They have been occurring for over a hundred years, if not longer, come 
          from all over the world, and are supported by a wide variety of evidence. This 
          video presents ten extensive onboard encounters. In each of these cases, the 
          witnesses were not only taken onboard; they were able to hold conversations with 
          the ETs. Each of these cases provides fascinating and profound insights into what 
          it’s like to have direct contact with extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p><b>THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANNI LATTU</b>. In <b>early 1917</b>, the residents of the 
          small village of Jyrinvaara, Finland were puzzled by the disappearance of Anni Lattu, 
          who lived in the area. When Annie returned, she shocked everyone with her claim that 
          a silver craft had landed next to her cottage, and short little beings had taken her 
          onboard. Although she was frightened, the humanoids were very friendly and took her 
          on a tour across the world and into outer space. They offered her the opportunity 
          to stay with them. Annie declined, and they returned her to her home, days later.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS LIFTED INTO THE SKY</b>. In the <b>summer of 1953</b>, Derek (age 5) 
          was walking along a remote dirt road near his home in rural Phenix City, Alabama. 
          He was nervous, as he had recently twice seen a Bigfoot-like creature in the 
          nearby ravine. This time, he was shocked when a beam of light struck him from 
          above and he found himself being lifted into the sky toward a metallic craft. 
          Inside, he saw three humanoids, who assured him that no harm would come to him. 
          He was returned, but that night, he woke up to see three even more unusual 
          creatures in his room.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS BEING WATCHED</b>. In <b>1961</b>, Joyce Halfin (age 6) was in her bedroom 
          in Ottawa, Canada when she saw strange figures by her window. Suddenly she flew up in 
          the sky over her house. She blacked out and assumed it must have been a crazy dream. But 
          she knew it wasn’t and as she grew up, more encounters occurred. Curious, she tried 
          hypnosis, and learned that in <b>1961</b>, she was taken onboard by praying mantis-type 
          ETs and physically examined. Later, she was taken again, and they told her how they pilot 
          their craft and other spiritual information.</p>

          <p><b>IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME</b>. In <b>June 1978</b>, an anonymous high-ranking 
          Soviet officer walked along the shore of Lake Pyrogovskoye in the Soviet Union when he 
          was approached by two strange men in jumpsuits. They spoke to him telepathically, 
          requested to speak with him, and quickly took him onboard a craft. A long conversation 
          followed as the ETs answered all his questions. They gave him a demonstration of their 
          craft and even took him to their planet. They returned him to Earth and asked him not 
          to speak about his encounter.</p>

          <p><b>WE ARE ALL BROTHERS</b>. While hunting near his home in Baependi, Brazil, on 
          <b>May 16, 1979</b>, Arlindo Gabriel dos Santos was amazed to see a small, strange 
          object land in a nearby forest clearing. It was followed by two more. Then a large 
          craft landed, and short humanoids emerged. Afraid, Arlindo turned to flee, but found 
          himself being pulled onboard. The ETs held a conversation with him, explaining why 
          they were there and where they came from. He was then returned. He suffered many 
          physical symptoms. Strange landing traces were found at the site.</p>

          <p><b>WE ARE JUST MEASURING YOU</b>. On the night of <b>May 28, 1991</b>, Susan, a 
          resident of Burien Washington, was puzzled by the unexplained barking of her dog. That 
          night, she was woken in bed by an eerie blue light streaming through her window. Without 
          warning, she found herself lying on a table in a strange room surrounded by gray-type 
          extraterrestrials. They gave her a quick physical exam and returned her to her bedroom.</p>

          <p><b>I COULDN’T LOOK AWAY</b>. On the <b>night of September 2, 2021</b>, while cutting 
          wood outside his home in Wasilla, Alaska, Andrew was puzzled by the appearance of a 
          shining golden object in the sky. He became transfixed and started to receive powerful 
          telepathic communication. The object moved lower, and he found himself rising upwards and 
          into the craft. Inside, he was greeted by three short gray aliens who told him to stay calm 
          and began to examine him. Returned 15 minutes later, he knew his life would never be the 
          same again.</p>

          <p>While some remain skeptical that people are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft 
          and having face-to-face contact with ETs, those who have had this experience don’t have 
          the luxury of disbelief. They not only carry the weight of knowing their experiences are 
          true but dealing with a society that refuses to accept the reality of ET contact. 
          Thankfully things are changing for the better.</p>

          <h5>Jul 4, 2025 (1:09:32)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">One of the most interesting aspects of the UFO phenomenon are 
          humanoid encounters, and there are a lot of them. People across the world report a wide 
          variety of humanoids: grays, reptilian creatures, human-looking figures, short humanoids 
          and more. While most cases go unreported, there is now a worldwide database of many 
          thousands of encounters, many supported by multiple eyewitnesses, medical effects, animal 
          reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, landing traces and more. In this video we explore 
          seven shocking humanoid encounters. In each case the witnesses were thrust into the unknown 
          and confronted with something beyond their imagination.</p>

          <p><b>THE LOVELAND HUMANOIDS</b>. At <b>3:30 am on May 25, 1955</b>, Robert Hunnicutt was 
          driving home when he noticed three odd-looking figures standing by the road in Branch Hill, 
          Ohio. He stopped his car and was shocked to see that the figures were not human. They had 
          thin misshapen bodies and frog-like faces. They turned to look at him and he froze. The 
          next thing he knew, he was racing off to the Loveland police station. Unknown to Robert, 
          other people had reported UFOs in the area that same evening. This was the first of many 
          humanoid and UFO encounters in the area.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS OUT THERE</b>. On the <b>night of November 13, 1967</b>, 
          a young couple drove stopped along a forested country road in Surrey, England. Smelling 
          a foul odor, they were about to drive off when a strange humanoid appeared next to 
          their car. It had a white featureless face and a dark body. The couple drove off in 
          fear. One year later in the same area, another young couple experienced a similar 
          encounter. As it turned out, the area has a long history of incredible UFO activity 
          and more bizarre humanoid encounters.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS GLUED TO THE GROUND</b>. It was a quiet <b>night on July 22, 1968</b>, 
          at the Pereyra Psychiatric Hospital in Mendoza, Argentina as nurse Adela Casalvieri 
          was drawn outside by a loud buzzing noise. Stepping into the courtyard, she was 
          immediately struck by a red beam of light. The beam retracted and she saw a large 
          craft covered with colored lights. Through several portholes she could see humanoid 
          figures moving about. The craft darted off, leaving radiation marks on the ground, 
          and burns on Adela’s hands and face. Other people saw the craft, and soon many 
          people were reporting UFOs and humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>ETS AT THE ELECTRICAL STATION</b>. On the <b>night of July 23, 1968</b>, security 
          guard Daildo de Oliveira was making his rounds at the Central Power Plant in Bauru, 
          Brazil. He noticed two men in dark jumpsuits trespassing one of the offices and 
          confronted them. A physical fight ensued. A third man appeared, this one dressed in a 
          light jumpsuit. The three intruders wrestled Daildo to the ground. Subduing him, they 
          quickly walked off and entered a large metallic craft landed on the ground a short 
          distance away. It rose up, zigzagged and darted away at high speed.</p>

          <p><b>IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME</b>. On the <b>night of July 19, 1972</b>, a 
          young man was playing basketball in the barn next to his home in Pioneer, Michigan 
          when he noticed an intense ball of swirling light near him. He watched in shock as 
          the light suddenly elongated and out stepped a gray alien. The witness felt a 
          strange pressure in his head as the being tried to communicate with him telepathically. 
          He ran off and told his mother. Later that night, they both saw a UFO while driving, 
          and later, the boy would have a very close-up encounter with a UFO.</p>

          <p><b>THIS CREATURE WAS NOT HUMAN</b>. For the past few nights, “Sarah,” had noticed 
          unusual lights near her home in rural Clovis, California. On the <b>morning of November 
          10, 1986</b>, she decided to hike out to the area with her dog to investigate. Suddenly 
          an intense fear overwhelmed her for no apparent reason. Her dog was mysteriously gone. 
          Turning around, she saw a short gray alien staring at her. It lifted its hand and waved 
          at her. Sarah ran home and realized she was missing two hours of time. She forgot the 
          event until one year later, when she woke up to find a gray alien in her bedroom.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN BESIDE MY BED</b>. In the <b>middle of the night on August 25, 2022</b>, 
          Natalie woke up in her bedroom to see a shadowy figure with a huge head standing by her 
          bed, touching her knee. It sent a message telling her not to be afraid. With a shock, 
          Natalie realized it was an alien. The figure disappeared. Following the encounter, 
          Natalie discovered that she was cured of her chronic insomnia. But following this 
          incident, she began to wake up with her clothes on wrong and strange marks on her body. 
          Soon she had another encounter.</p>

          <p>These seven humanoid encounters provide a tantalizing glimpse into what it’s like 
          to have direct contact with extraterrestrials. And yet they are just the tip of the 
          iceberg. The truth about ET contact has been covered up for too long. It’s time for 
          all humanity to know that there is other life in the universe. And they find humanity 
          of great interest.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter"><p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown: 
          Episode Twelve,” the ongoing UFO investigative series exploring a wide variety of 
          locations on Earth, proving that every town and city on this planet has been visited by 
          extraterrestrials. More than 100 locations have been explored, and all have a long and 
          rich history of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters and 
          more are all represented. Name any place on the globe, and you can find an encounter 
          there. In this episode we explore nine new locations: Paducah, Kentucky; Shakopee, 
          Minnesota; Wilton, Maine; Doncaster, UK; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Bensalem, 
          Pennsylvania and Brigantine, New Jersey.</p>

          <p><b>PADUCAH, KENTUCKY</b>. In <b>1957</b>, two men saw a UFO which caused their car 
          to stall. In <b>1993</b>, a family saw three metallic UFOs circling over their home. 
          In <b>2005</b>, a man saw a huge black triangle at very low elevation. In <b>2008</b>, 
          a young man saw a classic flying saucer right outside his window, an encounter which 
          triggered profound changes in his life.</p>

          <p><b>SHAKOPEE, MINNESOTA</b>. In <b>2005 and 2013</b>, two separate encounters 
          occurred while the witnesses drove along the freeway and saw craft overhead. In 
          <b>2015</b>req32, a witness observed a brilliant object overhead and managed to 
          capture a photograph of it. In broad <b>daylight in 2006</b>, a man saw a massive 
          bell-shaped craft far too large to be any conventional craft.</p>

          <p><b>WILTON, MAINE</b>. On <b>October 16, 2004</b>, a mother noticed a strange 
          static interference on her baby monitor. Going outside, she was amazed to see a 
          string of colored lights hovering over the field behind her house. Her husband saw 
          it too, and both became so uneasy, they fled inside.</p>

          <p><b>DONCASTER, UNITED KINGDOM</b>. In <b>1975</b>, three boys saw a UFO so low, 
          they thought it would land. In <b>1975</b>, a family saw a UFO hover in the field behind 
          their home. In <b>1980, 1988, 1997 and 1998</b> each produced high quality UFO 
          sightings that researchers couldn’t explain. In one case the UFO was so low, the 
          witness could smell it.</p>

          <p><b>MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA</b>. In </b>1952</b>, a man saw a UFO over his 
          farm and shot it with his gun. Days later, a reporter and his family saw apparently 
          the same craft. In <b>1975</b>, a man saw a classic saucer flying along the shoreline 
          in broad daylight. In <b>2013</b>, a couple saw a UFO after a fireworks display. In 
          <b>2017 and 2022</b>, two cases involved photographic evidence.</p>

          <p><b>PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA</b>. In <b>1949</b>, a pilot reported a near-miss 
          with a UFO. In <b>1956</b>, there were two cases of very unusual lights over the 
          city. In <b>1966</b>, two men reported a craft landing in front of their car and a 
          face-to-face encounter with the UFO occupant. That same year, there was a UFO display 
          involving a fleet of seven saucers. In <b>1978</b>, more than a dozen police officers 
          and hundreds of citizens saw UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>MACON, GEORGIA</b>. In <b>1950</b>, the military dismissed eyewitness reports of 
          speeding white objects in the night sky. In <b>1951</b>, a military pilot encountered a UFO 
          which played cata-and-mouse games with his aircraft for more than 10 minutes. One year 
          later, multiple pilots saw a UFO by their planes. In <b>1955</b>, there were at least 
          two sightings of strange craft overhead. In <b>1957</b>, three truck drivers 
          encountered an egg-shaped object on the highway. In <b>1958</b> there was a sighting 
          directly over Robin AFB. And one year later in <b>1959</b>, more than 500 people 
          reported unusual lights in the sky. In <b>1973</b>, a woman reported her encounter 
          with a landed UFO and strange beings in the forest outside of Macon. And in <b>1973</b>, 
          a rash of sightings involved more than a dozen police officers who were vehement that 
          they had seen UFOs. Sightings continued in <b>2018</b> and <b>2019</b>.</p>

          <p><b>BENSALEM, PENNSYLVANIA</b>. A very interesting case in Bensalem involved a couple 
          who, in <b>1973</b>, saw a boomerang-shaped craft and moments later, a dogman-like 
          creature. In <b>1975</b>, a man photographed a UFO almost identical to a photo published 
          by J. Allen Hynek. In <b>1977</b>, a family had a prolonged encounter with a classic 
          flying saucer which resulted in direct contact. Another case in <b>1989</b> involved a 
          witness who himself was a UFO investigator.</p>

          <p><b>BRIGANTINE, NEW JERSEY</b>. In <b>1953</b>, a man saw a mothership come over the 
          water and release several smaller craft. In <b>2015</b>, a man had so many encounters 
          with strange orbs, he finally was able to capture them on video. In <b>2019</b>, a man 
          saw a massive craft over the town which was nearly invisible in the night sky.</p>
          
          <p>So many locations, so many cases, and so many firsthand eyewitnesses! The deeper you 
          look, the more cases you find. The truth is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere 
          on this planet. And the implications of this are profound. It means that UFO encounters 
          are far more common than previously believed. It means that UFOs are apparently 
          conducting a vigorous publicity campaign announcing their presence. And most important 
          of all, it means that we are not alone, and UFOs are real!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The UFO phenomenon is incredibly complex and varied. There 
          are many different types of encounters, and much confusion and fear still surround this 
          subject, which makes it very difficult to categorize and comprehend extraterrestrial 
          contact. This video presents twelve different types of cases: sightings, landings, 
          humanoids and more. Each case contains the trademark high strangeness that accompanies 
          UFO contact.</p>

          <p><b>THE END OF THE WORLD</b>. At <b>5am on April 14, 1946</b>, Paul Cummings Jr and 
          his friend, Douglas Gowd drove along a remote highway outside Havana, Illinois when a 
          brilliant glowing object appeared in front of them on the highway. Suddenly it zoomed 
          forward causing them to veer off the highway, flee their car and lay face-down on the 
          ground.</p>

          <p><b>THE PERFECT CASE?</b> At <b>3am on October 23, 1954</b>, farmer Carmelo Papotto 
          went to check on his fields located in Tripoli, Libya. He was amazed to see a strange 
          craft land. It had a metallic base with wheels on the bottom. The top had a transparent 
          dome with six human-looking men inside. He tried to touch the craft and received a bad 
          shock. Was this craft ET or something else?</p>

          <p><b>PANIC AT 8000 FEET</b>. On the <b>night of November 21, 1954</b>, a Brazilian 
          passenger plane with 13 passengers was flying over Paraiba River, Brazil. Without 
          warning, the inside of the plane filled with light. Looking outside, the passengers 
          saw 19 flying saucers pacing the plane. The passengers panicked and chaos reigned in 
          the cabin. A few passengers had to be physically restrained.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG</b>. Early on the <b>night of May 12, 1963</b>, three 
          boys were rowing on a small lake in Sawyer, Michigan when they noticed two shadowy 
          figures by the side of the lake. At the same moment, a large glowing craft appeared 
          over the lake by their boat. The boys rowed away in fear and ran home. But arriving 
          home, they were missing more than 1 hour of time.</p>

          <p><b>THE SHOCKING UFO</b>. At <b>9pm on June 14, 1964</b>, Charles Englebrecht was 
          watching TV in his home when a weird light appeared outside and the power in his 
          house went out. Going outside, he saw a strange object landed in his yard. He tried 
          to get close but was held back by a forcefield. The object took off but caused many 
          strange and unique effects. Others also reported seeing the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING FROM ANOTHER WORLD</b>. At <b>1am on June 29, 1964</b>, Beauford Parham 
          was driving near Lavonia, Georgia when a top-shaped craft dropped from the sky and 
          hovered above his car. It followed him for 2 miles before coming right at him and 
          blasting him with heat. Both he and his car were burned by the craft. It was one of 
          several similar incidents in the area at that time.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO FORCEFIELD</b>. On the <b>night of December 31, 1972</b>, two young 
          women were walking near their homes in Pulkkinen, Finland. Suddenly a red orb kept 
          appearing and disappearing near them. Without warning, a large craft appeared in 
          front of them. One of the women was thrown to the ground by a strange force, and 
          the other was immobilized. Both broke free and fled the area.</p>

          <p><b>UFO GOES POSTAL</b>. On the <b>night of October 2, 1976</b>, Albert Young was 
          in his home in Palestine, Texas when he heard a squeaking noise outside. It sounded 
          like his neighbor’s mailbox being struck by a car. Looking outside, he saw that 
          instead it was a UFO. The next morning, the mailbox was found a long distance from 
          its original location.</p>

          <p><b>PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING</b>. On the <b>night of June 1983</b>, hundreds of people 
          were enjoying a movie at a drive-in theater in Mobile, Alabama. Suddenly two UFOs showed 
          up, causing the crowd of movie-goers to panic. Strangely, after the incident, many of the 
          people there had no memory of the event.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN SKELETONS</b>. One <b>day in March 1987</b>, a medical doctor was walking 
          on his 400-acre farm in rural western Kentucky and came upon a perfect circle of burned 
          vegetation. Much weirder were two humanoid skeletons lying nearby. He called the police. 
          The Air Force soon showed up, gathered the evidence, covered up the landing traces, and 
          threatened the witness.</p>

          <p><b>WE WERE BEING WATCHED</b>. Late at <b>night on November 19, 1989</b>, Officer “Dale” 
          was patrolling the backroads of his town in rural Arkansas. Coming upon four teenagers in 
          a pickup, he was ready to warn them about staying up too late. To his shock, there was a 
          flying saucer blocking the road. At that point, the engine of his cruiser died. Like the 
          kids, he was stranded.</p>

          <p><b>THE FLOATING CAR</b>. On the <b>night of February 26, 1996</b>, Andres Landiera was 
          driving to his home in Guitiriz, Spain when his car engine starting to fail. Suddenly he 
          realized that his car was floating in the sky 30 feet high. It was set down after just a 
          few moments, but the incident scared him badly. Unknown to him, many people in the area 
          were seeing UFOs.</p>

          <p>Twelve cases, each showing how UFO encounters can manifest in many different ways and 
          cause many different reactions. Each adds to our knowledge of these strange visitors to 
          our planet.</p>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Jun 13, 2025 (1:05:26)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The UFO contact story of Mateo Tremblay (pseudonym) is both 
          extensive and unusual. He has had lifelong interactions with a variety of extraterrestrials, 
          including grays, human-looking ETs and at least one reptilian encounter. He has had numerous 
          onboard encounters, two near-death experiences, many face-to-face encounters, direct 
          telepathic communications, and a long list of paranormal experiences. He has interfaced 
          directly with the grays and learned volumes of information about them.</p>

          <p>Mateo’s first memory of ET contact began in <b>1970</b>, when he was only four years old. 
          At the time, he lived with his mother and stepfather in a six-story apartment building in a 
          large city in France. One night, Mateo woke up to find himself somewhere else. He was lying 
          on a comfortable table in a small round room with glowing white, rounded walls. Standing 
          next to him was an 8-foot-tall, hooded figure helped him off the table and said, “It is 
          done now.” Mateo sensed the figure was female and tried to see what she looked like. She 
          said, “You are not allowed to do that.” A male figure stood by, next to a small console. 
          The female led him to the wall and said, “Let me show you your home.” The wall turned 
          transparent, and a huge green planet appeared. Mateo felt an intense longing. The scene 
          moved to a scene of swirling stars, and then the Earth. The lady said, “You must go home 
          now.” Suddenly Mateo woke up in bed. That morning, his concerned mother told Mateo that he 
          was missing from his room in the middle of the night. He told her what happened, and she 
          said to never forget the experience, and never tell anyone.</p>

          <p>That same year, Mateo and his family went to the beach. Mateo entered the water and 
          was pulled under the surface. He was missing for 15 minutes before he was found. He was 
          given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and fully recovered. Before long, more strange 
          experiences occurred. While walking to school, he started to experience missing-time 
          episodes. Mateo soon had recall of being taken to a strange round chamber. There were 
          other children and a tall female humanoid who instructed the children on various subjects. 
          Mateo recalled being given an implant in his leg. Mateo had several such encounters. When 
          strange marks appeared on his body, his parents were investigated for child abuse. 
          Thankfully, they were found innocent.</p>

          <p>Mateo grew up, got married and started a family. On <b>August 8, 1988</b> (now living 
          in New Zealand) he was visited by the grays again. Mateo was concerned because now the 
          contact involved not only him, but his family. The marriage didn’t work out, and Mateo 
          moved out and found another place to live. One <b>night in September, 1993</b> (at age 27), a 
          foreboding feeling enveloped him, and he found himself pulled from his home into a 
          transparent spherical craft. Two other men were there and a human-looking pilot. They 
          were shown a massive mother ship. Mateo was then returned. Soon Mateo began seeing UFOs 
          and started to experience incredible telepathic communications from the ETs. He joined a 
          contactee group and began to meditate regularly, which caused an escalation of psychic 
          abilities and communications with the ETs. He had a second near-death experience with a 
          life review.</p>

          <p>He then had more onboard experiences where he saw grays, human-looking ETs, other ETs 
          and many other people, some of whom were undergoing strange examinations. His concern 
          turned to anger. He returned and decided to pull back from connecting with the grays. He 
          still had psychic experiences, but his contacts slowed down. Years passed with few experiences, 
          except for one amazing sighting.</p>

          <p>But in <b>2021</b>, Mateo was visited in his bedroom by an apparent reptilian entity. It 
          was a deeply frightening and traumatizing encounter. But it encouraged him to reach out 
          telepathically to the grays. They told him that they had heard his plea to assist with the 
          healing of his cat, who had recently been diagnosed with severe health problems, and had 
          come to do a healing. Mateo was still furious, but thankfully his cat made a near full 
          recovery. Following this, Mateo began to have deeper communications and intense telepathic 
          downloads with the ETs.</p>

          <p>Says Mateo: "I have never claimed to hold the 'truth'" and be so presumptuous as to know 
          why the EBEs are interacting with us. In fact, after fifty years I am still unsure and 
          confused to a large degree… Yet I must confront the facts: physical sightings leave no 
          doubts; physical scarring leaves no doubts. The interface and gifts are all but too real 
          to dismiss. Most of all, this profound knowing is more than just a core belief system. A 
          lifetime of studies in metaphysics, physics, psychology, and neurolinguistics have helped 
          tremendously to somewhat put some of the pieces of the puzzle together or glean some types 
          of patterns."</p>

          <h5>Jun 6, 2025 (1:16:03)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There can be no doubt that the UFO phenomenon is real. Documented 
          reports of UFOs number in the many millions. There is much debate about what they are and 
          where they come from, but the evidence is overwhelming that they do exist. The same is true 
          for humanoids. Such reports are more rare, but the fact that people are seeing humanoids is 
          undeniable. Cases come from all over the world and have been reported for more than a hundred 
          years. This video presents ten astonishing cases involving a wide variety of humanoids. These 
          ten cases alone provide enough data to offer profound insights into the nature of the 
          extraterrestrial presence on our planet.</p>

          <p><b>WE CAN’T LET YOU THROUGH</b>. One day in <b>1930</b>, a woman was driving to her home 
          in Texas when she came upon a saucer-shaped craft landed by the road. Standing in the middle 
          of the road was a group of odd humanoids. She held a brief conversation with the strange 
          beings and continued on her way, arriving home at midnight. She was missing 14 hours of time.</p>

          <p><b>IT DOESN’T MATTER, IT’S A CHILD</b>. One <b>morning in 1945</b>, Julio (age 13) left 
          his home in Lavadores, Spain to fetch a pail of water. He had done this many times, but on 
          this occasion, upon reaching the fountain, he was confronted by two strange figures. One 
          looked much like Jesus Christ and the other a tall gray ET. He dropped the bucket and 
          ran.</p>

          <p><b>THE GESTICULATING EXTRATERRESTRIAL</b>. One day in <b>August 1958</b>, a man stepped 
          outside his home in rural Paraibo do Sul, Brazil. A shiny craft dropped from the sky and 
          landed nearby. A handsome man with long blond hair and fair skin, wearing a skintight 
          jumpsuit, emerged and began to communicate using a series of gestures. Unable to make 
          himself understood, he re-entered his craft and left.</p>

          <p><b>THE GLINIK HUMANOIDS</b>. One <b>summer day in 1950</b>, Sofia X stepped outside 
          her home in Glinik, Poland and saw an odd-looking man standing in a field. Suddenly he 
          levitated into the sky and disappeared. Years later, her 6-year-old son saw a bizarre 
          UFO in the same exact spot. It turned out that many people in the small village were 
          seeing UFOs and many different types of humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>IT WAS BEAUTIFUL</b>. At <b>7am on February 15, 1963</b>, Charles Brew and his son 
          milked their cows on their farm in Moe, Australia. Hearing an odd noise, Charles saw a 
          silvery craft emerge from the clouds and hover above a nearby tree. His farm animals 
          scattered, and Charles was amazed to see two humanoid figures in a clear dome on the 
          craft. It darted away, leaving Charles with a bad headache.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED</b>. On the <b>night of July 20, 1968</b>, three teenage 
          girls saw a glowing UFO over Lake Kaarnajarv, Estonia. Returning inside, their bedroom 
          filled with light, and looking outside they saw a craft hovering nearby. It winked out, 
          but one of the girls felt compelled to go outside and saw a female humanoid standing a 
          short distance away. Later, weird landing traces were found.</p>

          <p><b>GLOWING ORANGE HUMANOIDS</b>. On the <b>morning of August 24, 1970</b>, three 
          witnesses from Olmstead Falls, Ohio, waiting for a bus, saw two humanoids dressed in 
          glowing orange jumpsuits and conical hats carrying a strange disc-shaped object over 
          their heads, then walk off into a field. Later another witness was found who saw them 
          enter a craft. Landing traces were found, and more UFOs were seen in the area.</p>

          <p><b>EYES LIKE BLACK MIRRORS</b>. One <b>night in July 1988</b>, an 8-year-old boy was 
          awoken by bright colored lights in his room. Looking outside he saw a strange craft. 
          Suddenly the doorway to his room blazed with light and a gray ET appeared. Time seemed 
          to stop as two more beings came in and entered his room. As they approached, he 
          blacked out. Later he wondered if they had come to cure an ill member of the home.</p>

          <p><b>WE ARE YOUR SISTERS</b>. One <b>summer evening in 1990</b>, a 6-year-old girl woke 
          up when bright lights streamed into the bedroom of her home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. 
          Suddenly, two slender shadowy figures entered her bedroom. They were gray ETs. She was 
          unable to move as they communicated with her telepathically and conducted a strange exam. 
          It was an encounter that changed her life forever.</p>

          <p><b>THE CHILD-LIKE ETS</b>. On <b>December 12, 1997</b>, Jakov Vrancic tended his sheep 
          outside his home in Cvrljevo, Croatia. Hearing an odd buzzing sound, he went to investigate 
          and came upon a landed UFO and several child-like humanoids with large heads and gray skin. 
          He spoke with them for a few minutes until they returned to the craft which took off. Much 
          to his dismay, his case brought him unwanted attention.</p>

          <p>These ten cases are just a tiny sample of the growing worldwide database of similar 
          encounters. While our govts have now admitted to the validity of UFOs, they have yet to 
          acknowledge the many humanoid reports. This is strange because these cases represent the 
          cutting edge of UFO research. After all, something or someone is inside UFOs. The 
          evidence points towards UFOs being craft piloted by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Of all types of UFO encounters, the most extensive and profound 
          are cases where people are taken onboard a craft and interact with extraterrestrials face-
          to-face. Thousands of these cases from across the planet have been documented, though many 
          researchers believe they number in the millions. These cases have the most information and 
          hold the greatest potential to answer many of the questions surrounding extraterrestrial 
          contact. This video presents seven onboard UFO encounters. These cases involve many 
          different types of ETs and they provide a fascinating glimpse into who these beings are, 
          where they come from and why they are visiting our planet.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ALBERT LANCASHIRE</b>. One <b>evening in 1942</b>, 
          27-year-old army officer, Albert Lancashire, stood in the guard booth at a secret radar 
          site near Newbiggen-by-the Sea, England. Suddenly a light appeared and moved towards him, 
          showing itself to be a disc-shaped craft. The craft struck him with a beam of light, and he 
          passed out. When he awoke, the craft was gone. This was followed by UFO dreams, paranormal 
          events and another UFO sighting. After many years, he recalled being lifted into the craft, 
          examined, and then returned.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF PAMELA WIMMER</b>. In <b>1975</b>, Pamela Wimmer (age 22) 
          was at her home in Dresden, Maine when she heard her child scream from the front yard. She ran 
          outside and saw a huge saucer-shaped craft. It moved off, but it reminded her that, at 
          age 10, she and a friend were chased home by a craft. At age 14, three small grays pulled 
          her from her bed, into a craft parked in front of her house. Inside, she was given a 
          physical exam, saw weird star-charts, and was shown the Earth floating in space. The ETs 
          asked her if she would like to go with them. Pamela declined, and they brought her home.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF SUSAN</b>. In <b>1968</b>, “Susan,” (age 9) was playing 
          with friends near their homes in Port Augusta, South Australia when they saw odd lights 
          hovering overhead. One year later, she was in her bedroom in Adelaide when three short 
          figures and one tall one arrived and pulled her onboard a craft. She was physically 
          examined. They showed her images of a planet experiencing a worldwide disaster. They 
          told her that she had important work to do on Earth. This was the first of many 
          encounters, including a few involving intimate relations with a tall gray.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROBERLA T</b>. Stepping on to the porch of her Phoenix, 
          Arizona home on the night of <b>June 23, 1973</b>, Roberla saw a star-like light descending. 
          As it approached, she saw it was a strange craft. A door opened and she could see a tall 
          humanoid figure. She passed out. Years later, she went under hypnosis and recalled that 
          the figure approached her and levitated her into the craft where she was physically 
          examined.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF FRANCESCO OJEDA</b>. On <b>March 3, 1976</b>, twelve-
          year-old Francesco Ojeda went missing near his home in rural Fortaleza, Brazil. Two days 
          later, he was found by his parents wandering in the forest, burned and unable to see. He 
          recovered his sight. He said that while walking home from school, he came upon a landed 
          craft and two small humanoids. They entered into the craft which stuck him with a beam of 
          light. He passed out and woke up onboard the craft. The ETs examined him, said they meant 
          him no harm, and told him that ETs were visiting Earth in large numbers.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DR SIMON TAYLOR &amp; REZA</b>. On <b>September 16, 
          1976</b>, Simon Taylor and his friend Reza went camping tin the Elburz Mountains near 
          Tehran, Iran. In the middle of the night they were woken up by three dark-suited figures 
          with large eyes who led them into a craft. Inside they sat on a Persian rug while the 
          craft took them on a tour around planet Earth. They were returned miles from where 
          they were taken. Both were forever changed by their shared encounter.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER UFO ENCOUNTER OF TATIANA MIKHAYLOVONA</b>. Walking to her 
          home in Protvino, Russia, on the evening of <b>September 13, 1989</b>, Tatiana 
          Mikhalovona was startled by two tall women in silver jumpsuits who approached her. She 
          was unable to resist as they led her to a landed flying saucer and took her onboard. They 
          asked if she’d like to go for a short ride. Tatiana didn’t want to, but the beings 
          convinced her. Tatiana was amazed when she looked out of the porthole of the craft and 
          saw the city lights below her. After a 10-minute ride, they returned her to Earth and 
          promised to meet her again.</p>

          <p>These seven cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but these alone provide an accurate 
          representation of what it’s like to be taken onboard an ET craft and meet ETs face-to-
          face. There are so many cases with remarkable commonalities, coming from all over the 
          world, that they are impossible to deny or explain away. They provide powerful testimony 
          that we are being visited by a wide variety of beings from beyond Earth.</p>

          <h5>May 23, 2025 (1:29:08)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to Episode Eleven of the ongoing series: UFOs in 
          Your Hometown. This series was born from a challenge: name any town, city or location 
          on this planet, and I will find at least one UFO encounter there. With nearly 100 
          locations explored from across the planet, every single one shows a long, rich history 
          of UFO encounters of all kinds: sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard cases and more. 
          We now explore four new locations: Vancouver, BC, Canada; Lake Havasu, Arizona; 
          Thomasville, North Carolina and Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. All types of encounters 
          are represented, along with a wide variety of evidence: medical effects, landing traces, 
          electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, radar-returns, photographs and more. So 
          come along on a journey that is sure to change the way you feel about the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <p><b>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA</b>. In <b>1912</b>, a farm-boy came upon a landed UFO with 
          humanoids. In <b>1933</b>, after a wave of sightings, witnesses observed an apparent 
          UFO crash and alien bodies. Year after year, Vancouver has sightings of solid metallic 
          craft, in <b>1939, 1955, 1964, 1968</b> and more. In <b>1968</b>, a group of boys came 
          upon a landed UFO and a humanoid on a golf course. In <b>1970</b>, a man describes his 
          encounter with a fleet of tiny UFOs. In <b>1977</b>, a mother and daughter saw a flying 
          saucer hover right over a church. That same year, two weather observers at Vancouver 
          Int’l Airport saw a huge craft with portholes. In <b>1978</b>, neighbors saw a closeup 
          UFO hover over their homes. In <b>1985</b>, a classroom of students and a teacher saw a 
          strange craft hover over the schoolyard. In <b>1990</b>, a child saw a gray ET in his 
          hotel room. In <b>1997</b>, a woman’s sighting of a craft drew the attention of NORAD. 
          That same year, a lady and her grandson had a dramatic encounter with a hamburger-shaped 
          UFO. In <b>2000</b>, two amateur astronomers were shocked by their sighting of a V-shaped 
          craft. In <b>April and May of 2001</b>, two brothers had three close-up sightings; one 
          of the witnesses had telepathic communication. More dramatic sightings of metallic discs 
          occurred in <b>2001 and 2003</b>. In <b>2015</b>, a Vancouver woman reported her 
          encounter with a strange humanoid in her bedroom.</p>

          <p><b>LAKE HAVASU, ARIZONA</b>. In <b>1968</b>, a daylight disc was seen directly over 
          Lake Havasu. The best-known sighting in this area occurred in <b>1968</b> when two 
          Cessna pilots saw dozens of craft performing fantastic maneuvers. In <b>1994</b>, a 
          woman and her child had an encounter with a massive UFO over their house. They could 
          see humanoids through the portholes. When the humanoids entered their house, they 
          packed up and moved away. In <b>1996</b>, a group of witnesses saw a glowing green 
          craft, resulting in missing time. More amazing cases of solid craft encounters occurred 
          in <b>2000, 2005 and 2006</b>. In <b>2009</b>, a witness videotaped a solid metallic 
          disc hovering over Lake Havasu in broad daylight. In <b>2010</b>, an entire family 
          observed a UFO being chased by military jet aircraft. This is just a small sample of 
          UFOs seen over the Lake Havasu area, proving once again that UFOs are seen everywhere.</p>

          <p><b>THOMASVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA</b>. In <b>1965</b> a man had a very close encounter 
          with a cylindrical craft hovering only 200 feet above the ground. One <b>night in 1969</b>, 
          two independent witnesses pulled off the road to observe a classic flying saucer hover 
          over the nearby trees. When a strange humanoid appeared in one of the windows, they 
          drove off in a panic. Arriving home, one of the witnesses realized he was missing about 
          45 minutes of time. <b>One night in 1996</b>, a man was driving along the road when he 
          saw a UFO sending down a beam of light in the field next to him. Soon the UFO zoomed 
          towards him, coming directly over his vehicle. In <b>1998</b>, a father and son fishing 
          on a lake had a very close encounter with a silver spherical craft. So many cases!</p>

          <p><b>ISLE OF WIGHT, UNITED KINGDOM</b>. So many cases here. In <b>1952</b>, an RAF 
          radarman tracked 8 objects flying over the Isle of Wight. In <b>1954</b>, a UFO was 
          seen over a wide area. In <b>1956</b> two jet fighter pilots chased a UFO along the 
          coast, catching it on radar. In <b>1959</b>, a group of 8 amateur astronomers observed 
          5 “mystery satellites.” In <b>1961</b>, a mother and daughter had a very close encounter 
          with a metallic disc. In <b>1967</b>, a group of students saw a wobbling UFO behind 
          their school, leaving behind landing traces. In <b>1970</b>, a man had a series of 
          sightings. Three years later, his daughter and a friend had a bizarre humanoid 
          encounter with the “Sandown Clown,” destined to become the area’s most famous case. 
          Over the next decades, year after year, many other sightings occurred, some which 
          were investigated by the Royal Air Force.</p>

          <p>So many cases of all kinds. The ubiquitous nature of UFOs cannot be denied. If every 
          location on this planet has truly been visited by UFOs, the implications of this are 
          profound. UFOs appear to be putting on a publicity campaign announcing their presence. 
          The ETs have done their part to disclose. The rest is up to us.</p>

          <h5>May 16, 2025 (1:05:57)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This is the true story of a mother and son who shared an onboard 
          UFO encounter. One <b>night in 1974</b>, seven-year-old Richard Simon went to bed in his parents’ 
          home in Cleveland, Ohio. He didn’t know it, but his life was about to change forever. After 
          this night, Richard began to suffer from severe insomnia. Whenever nighttime arrived, he felt 
          compelled to make sure the windows and doors were locked. Still, he couldn’t sleep. His mother, 
          Inus, soon noticed that Richard was tired all the time, but neither of them could figure out the 
          reason for his insomnia. Richard grew up, becoming interested in technology, space exploration 
          and science fiction. He did well in school and was, by all accounts, a normal kid, except for 
          the insomnia, which continued up through adulthood.</p>

          <p>One night in <b>May of 1988</b>, at age 21, Richard and a friend went fishing along the 
          shore of Lake Erie. They made the short walk and began fishing. They soon noticed an eerie 
          silence that settled over the area. Weirdly, nobody else was there. Then a glowing gold-red 
          orb appeared, zoomed closer and darted upwards. Twenty minutes later they saw another. Looking 
          at their watches, they were shocked to see that more than four hours had passed. Neither could 
          believe the time had passed so quickly. After fishing for another two hours, they began the 
          walk back home. As they left, the eerie silence dissipated, and they went back home. The next 
          morning, they were amazed to read in the newspaper that many people in the area had seen UFOs.</p>

          <p>Three years later, Richard’s mother Inus decided to quit smoking. She found a hypnotherapist 
          to help her and told Richard that he should come along to get treatment for his insomnia. After 
          some cajoling, Richard agreed. They went to the office together. Inus went first and Richard sat 
          in the waiting room. He became concerned when he heard the muffled sound of his mother weeping. 
          An hour later, she came out. Richard asked her what was wrong, but she was silent and told him 
          to go see the therapist. The therapist asked him many questions, then put him under hypnosis and 
          asked about his insomnia. Richard began to see bright lights and strange  alien-looking faces. 
          Suddenly the walls of amnesia crumbled, and Richard remembered everything.</p>

          <p>He remembered waking up that fateful <b>night in 1974</b> to find the house filled 
          with an eerie blue light. Going to his mom’s room, he saw it was empty. Frightened, he 
          searched for her, and checking one of the rooms, saw the silhouette of a strange figure 
          outside. Suddenly the front door burst open, a blue light streamed in, and he saw a short 
          figure with a large head. The next thing he knew, he was lying immobilized on a table 
          inside a round silver room, surrounded by three short humanoids with large bald heads, 
          huge dark eyes and gray skin. A mid-sized gray stood nearby, and at the foot of the bed, 
          he saw a 7-foot-tall gray ET. Fear filled him as he realized that this wasn’t a nightmare, 
          it was really happening. The ETs seemed to be focused on his stomach area. They told him, 
          “Don’t worry, we’re going to take care of you. It will be okay.”</p>

          <p>To his right, he heard a woman screaming. Looking over, he saw her lying on a table. Relief 
          filled him. He wasn’t alone. As the exam continued, he again became filled with fear. The 
          mid-sized gray told him, “We need to check on something then you can go home.” Richard was 
          reassured. After about 45 long minutes, he passed out. He woke up the next morning with no 
          memory of the event.</p>

          <p>Now, talking to his mother, Inus said that she recalled waking up to realize that she was 
          in another place, lying on a metal table. She saw her son off to the left, surrounded by 
          short beings. She saw a mid-sized gray and a very tall one standing next to the wall. Cursing, 
          she shouted that they better not hurt her son. They said, “Don’t worry, we’re not going to hurt 
          him. She was unable to move. More angry than scared, she continued to protest. The next thing 
          she knew, she was waking up back in bed, with no memory. Both she and Richard marveled at the 
          fact that they both recalled the same thing. Then Inus told him that one morning, when she was 
          7 years old, she had gone to the barn of her parents’ farmhouse in rural Kentucky and saw a 
          strange humanoid creature.</p>

          <p>The odd events continued. Richard began having premonitions. After getting married and 
          having children, his 7-year-old daughter saw a humanoid in her bedroom. Doctors discovered 
          a strange implant in her sinus. The whole family started having UFO sightings. As time marched 
          on, his daughter got married and had kids, and her 7 year-old daughter started seeing a strange 
          humanoid in her room.</p>

          <p>This poignant and compelling case provides many profound insights into what it’s like 
          to deal with extraterrestrial contact, and answers many of the questions surrounding this
          subject. The Simon family is only one of many thousands (if not millions) who are being
          visited by ETs.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Being taken onboard a UFO! It is the ultimate type of UFO 
          encounter, the most extensive, and the most controversial. There are thousands of 
          cases on record. These cases have the greatest potential to answer the many questions 
          surrounding the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, such as who are these strange 
          visitors, where do they come from and why are they here? This video presents five 
          little known cases coming from all over the world. In each of these cases, the 
          witnesses held long conversations with the extraterrestrials. Each of these cases 
          was investigated by researchers. The five cases here add to the growing database of 
          close encounters of the fourth kind, making it increasingly undeniable that we are 
          being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p><b>TIME DOESN’T EXIST</b>. One <b>night in April 1970</b>, lawyer, Raymond Shearer, 
          (pseudonym) was driving outside Madison, Wisconsin and saw a light over his car. He felt 
          compelled to turn off on a remote road and came upon an ET craft. Suddenly, it was morning, 
          and he was arriving home. Beset with anxiety, he visited a therapist. Making no progress, the 
          therapist tried hypnosis, and recalled that he was taken onboard a craft by human-
          looking ETs who examined him and said that humans do not understand the nature of time, 
          how they fly their craft, that humans are too warlike for open contact, and that the 
          ETs have lost some of their people to conflicts with humans. They talked about the 
          power of water and many other topics, including advising Raymond about his career.</p>

          <p><b>WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS</b>. On <b>February 28, 1974</b>, Dirant Mello Ferraz (age 18) 
          was in his home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when he was pulled into a craft. Onboard, he met 
          a twin of himself who departed the craft and took Dirant’s place for a full 24-hours, learning 
          all he could about life on Earth. Meanwhile Dirant was kept onboard. He asked the ETs 
          many questions, which they answered, about why they chose him, what their mission on 
          Earth was, would they invade our planet, did they believe in God, and much more. They 
          asked him to tell the people of Earth that they are friendly and that it is their 
          mission to help humanity. After 24 hours, Dirant was returned to his home. Dirant’s 
          case was thoroughly researched, but afterward, he just wanted to forget about the 
          encounter and live a normal life.</p>

          <p><b>THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AREN’T READY</b>. On <b>December 25, 1976</b>, an anonymous 
          teacher, “Francisco,” was hunting outside of Merida, Spain when he became tired and 
          fell asleep. Waking up, it was night, and he realized a weird tentacle-like device 
          was pulling on his arm. To his shock, it was attached to a strange craft a short 
          distance away. He fainted and when he awoke, he thought he was in a hospital. But 
          when big-eyed, scaly-skinned creatures entered, he realized he was inside a craft. 
          After examining him, they gave him a tour of the craft, showed him an alien arboretum, 
          and fed him strange alien foods. They said they were on a benevolent scientific 
          expedition to study Earth, that their culture is far older than ours, that humans 
          are not ready for contact, and that it was his duty to tell the world about them.</p>

          <p><b>THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF MATTER</b>. At <b>9pm on September 20, 1979</b>, two 
          men in Sztum, Poland were shocked to see a UFO hover overhead. Suddenly they found themselves 
          flying upward into the craft. Inside, each held telepathic conversations with unseen entities 
          who talked on various topics such as mathematics, physics, the nature of matter and more. 
          Suddenly they were deposited back onto the ground and watched the craft dart away. Both 
          men had severe headaches. They tried to share their experience with friends, who 
          ridiculed them. Later, their case was extensively studied, and it was learned that one 
          year earlier, another truly remarkable encounter had occurred in the same area.</p>

          <p><b>WE WON’T DO YOU ANY HARM</b>. On the <b>night of January 12, 2008</b>, the Voronezhsky 
          family were puzzled by the appearance of strange lights above their home in Dubno, Ukraine. 
          Going to bed, they were awakened in the middle of the night by a light illuminating their home. 
          Rushing outside, they saw a giant craft overhead. Suddenly the parents, Vladimir and 
          Olga, were pulled up into the craft. Vladimir was unable to move as his wife was 
          examined. The gray-type ETs were very polite as they told the couple about ET society, 
          and their interest in human emotions. They said that they were able to travel great 
          distances, turn their ships invisible and much more. They gave the couple a tour through 
          space and then returned them home. Vladimir discovered he had greater strength and 
          endurance, and Olga was healed of colitis.</p>

          <p>Five onboard experiences, each with amazing similarities and unique details, each 
          providing further evidence of extraterrestrial intervention on planet Earth. It is 
          unknown exactly how many people have had an experience like this, but some researchers 
          believe it may number in the millions.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">One of the interesting things about encounters with strange 
          beings is that they are humanoid in form, bipedal beings that look much like us, but 
          are clearly not human. The humanoid form seems to be the universal template. This is 
          what the first-hand accounts are showing us. There are thousands of cases, going back 
          more than 100 years, coming from all over the world. Midget-like ETs, tall beings, 
          grays, robotic creatures, mantids, human-looking and more. This video presents 12 
          cases, each showing the variety and the unique high-strangeness aspects of face-to-face 
          encounters with humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>WE COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET</b>. One <b>evening in the summer of 
          1957</b>, a woman awoke in the bedroom of her home in Jutland, Denmark to see three 2-foot-tall 
          humanoids come through the closed window. Each looked identical, with beautiful human-
          looking faces and kind eyes. They said they came from a different planet and promptly left.</p>
          <p><b>ETS LAND AT FARMHOUSE</b>. One <b>day in October 1957</b>, a farmer and 
          his workers saw a flying saucer land on his farm in Campinas, Brazil. Three human-looking 
          figures exited and went to collect water from the river. They returned to their craft, 
          which took off. Many odd effects were found, landing traces, EM disturbances, metal 
          fragments, and more witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>EXTRATERRESTRIAL TOURISTS?</b> One <b>night in October 1959</b>, Mrs. 
          Moulet and her three children stepped out of their home in Aubagne, France to hang the 
          laundry. Suddenly an egg-shaped craft hovered overhead. Through a big porthole, they 
          saw 20 blond men in white shirts looking down smiling at them. Soon, the craft zoomed 
          off.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE GREEN MAN OF LUUMAKI</b>. On <b>August 19, 1965</b> and the 
          Kuningas family went berry-picking in the fields out of Hermunen in Luumaki, Finland. A 
          3-foot-tall humanoid appeared. It had red skin, a human-looking face, and wore a tight 
          green jumpsuit. The father and son were unable to move as the being approached, then 
          ran off into the woods.</p>

          <p><b>IF I HADN’T SEEN IT MYSELF, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONVINCED</b>. 
          One <b>night in February 1968</b>, a couple looked out of their home in Greensburg, Pennsylvania 
          to see a saucer-shaped craft over their backyard pond. To their shock, they saw a humanoid 
          figure standing on a railing outside the craft looking down at them. They called their 
          relatives who drove over and saw the craft.</p>

          <p><b>SIX ALIENS ON BEENLEIGH ROAD</b>. At <b>2am on July 19, 1972</b>, a man 
          drove to work along the Beenleigh Road, in Kuraby, Queensland, Australia. Suddenly he saw 
          six humanoid figures in cream-colored jumpsuits and diamond-like faceplates standing next 
          to the road. Nearby, a large craft hovered. He drove off in fear and vowed to never drive 
          that road again.</p>

          <p><b>THE MAN WAVED BACK</b>. Driving along a remote road in Covington, 
          Michigan, one <b>night in September 1973</b>, a man was shocked to see a UFO hover over the car 
          ahead of him. The car stopped, and the lady knelt down to pray. The man saw a blond man 
          looking at him through a porthole. He waved, and the man waved back, and the craft zipped 
          away.</p>

          <p><b>A PRESSURE INSIDE HIS HEAD</b>. At <b>10pm on January 6, 1978</b>, two 
          men were walked along a street in Santo Antonio da Caparico, Portugal when a light zoomed 
          overheard. They ran to get a closer look and saw by a 7-foot-tall being in a glowing white 
          jumpsuit. They fled in panic. Later, landing traces were found and one of the men suffered 
          weird effects.</p>

          <p><b>THE CREATURES IN THE WOODS</b>. On <b>April 27, 1986</b>, a karate teacher 
          and his student went jogging in the woods by Gravina di Puglia, Italy. Seeing two 7-foot-tall 
          figures in white uniforms, they ran and called the police. They soon learned that three hunters 
          also saw the beings. The police found odd marks on the ground where the beings had stood.</p>
          
          <p><b>“WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT ME?”</b> For days, “Lee” of Gary, Indiana 
          had a feeling of being watched. Then on the night of June 15, 1986, he awoke to see a gray 
          alien standing next to his bed. Afraid, he threw a pillow at it. The gray looked at him and 
          asked, “Why are you trying to hurt me?” Lee felt great love coming from the being, who promptly 
          vanished.</p>

          <p><b>IT’S NOT HUMAN</b>. One <b>night in October 2010</b>, two men were walking 
          along the foothills of the mountains in Tandil, Argentina when they saw a strange light. 
          Getting closer, they saw it was a glowing humanoid, wearing a clear helmet. When it started 
          to levitate, they turned and ran. To their shock, it began to follow them.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN AND THE SQUIRRELS</b>. One <b>morning in December 2012</b>, a 
          couple looked outside their home in Villaviciosa de Odon, Spain and were shocked to see 
          200 squirrels on their porch. Then they saw a 9-foot-tall humanoid in a red jumpsuit 
          floating in their backyard. After 15 minutes, it departed, and the squirrels dispersed.</p>

          <p>Twelve cases, each showing the familiar humanoid form, yet each with  unique details. 
          These cases make it clear that something profound is happening here, and that we still 
          have much to understand about these visitors to our planet.</p>

          <h5>Apr 25, 2025 (1:38:07)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to Episode Ten of UFOs in Your Hometown. The challenge 
          continues: name any town or city in the world, and I will find a UFO encounter there! This 
          includes sighting, landings, humanoids and onboard encounters. It appears that the UFO 
          occupants are conducting a carefully orchestrated and vigorous publicity campaign, 
          visiting every location on Earth, in an apparent attempt to announce their presence. 
          In this latest installment, we explore four new locations: Slovakia; Covington, Kentucky, 
          Chicago, Illinois and Sarasota, Florida. These four locations alone represent a microcosm 
          of UFO activity, containing enough cases to provide an accurate representation of the UFO 
          phenomenon. There are cases with multiple witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, 
          animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, photographs, radar returns, and more. 
          So come along on a journey that is sure to change the way you feel about UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>SLOVAKIA</b>: In <b>1944</b>, a physician observed a fleet of 8 UFO. In <b>1959</b>, 
          Air Force officers and airport employees viewed an object hover over an airfield and was 
          caught on radar. In <b>December 1967</b>, many people in the small village of Myjava saw 
          a UFO appeared directly above the local church. In <b>1971</b>, three people were taken 
          from their apartment to what they believed to be another planet. Slovakia’s most famous 
          encounter occurred in <b>1987</b> when a helicopter crew chased a UFO over the Vranov 
          reservoir. In <b>1997</b>, the residents of the small town of Milicin were panicked by a 
          very intense wave of encounters. In <b>1991</b> and <b>1992</b>, more sightings were 
          viewed by police and caught on radar. The years of <b>1993</b> and <b>1994</b> were 
          particularly active, with landings, multiple face-to-face encounters with humanoids and 
          a gentleman whose car was levitated into the sky. In <b>2005 and 2006</b>, multiple 
          low-level sightings over the Bohunice and Temelin Nuclear power stations caused concern 
          at high levels of government.</p>

          <p><b>COVINGTON, KENTUCKY</b>. In <b>July 1947</b>, residents observed a UFO with landing 
          legs flying at very low elevation over the city. In <b>1956</b>, a pilot had no less than 
          three encounters. In <b>1959</b>, police were flooded with calls about a UFO and a 
          strange creature. In <b>1975</b>, a gentleman in a high-rise building watched a UFO fly 
          around his building. In <b>1976</b>, a UFO hovered over the suburb, sending down a beam 
          of light. In <b>1978</b>, people across the city described a glowing green object, and 
          some reported seeing it land. In <b>1985</b>, police across Covington saw a UFO which 
          was also caught on radar. In <b>2017</b>, a Covington resident reported an object which 
          hovered for hours, causing a bizarre electromagnetic disturbance in his home.</p>

          <p><b>CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</b>. Numerous low-level sightings occurred in <b>1952</b>, 
          including one viewed by police over two radio towers. In <b>1954</b>, witnesses observed 
          a UFO hover and then land on the shores of Lake Michigan, disgorging a small humanoid. 
          <b>1954</b> produced several other cases, including a low-level sighting over an oil 
          refinery. In <b>1957</b>, policemen saw a UFO hovering directly over a cemetery. 
          <b>1963</b> brought sightings of classic UFOs with portholes moving only a few hundred 
          feet overhead and seen by hundreds of people. In <b>1965</b>, a man walking along the 
          shores of Lake Michigan came upon a landed UFO with a little spaceman standing next to 
          it. Dramatic and widely viewed sightings occurred regularly, in <b>1966</b>, <b>1973, 
          1978-79, and 1988</b>. In <b>1990</b>, a witness reported a low-level encounter with 
          a craft that caused odd physiological effects. In <b>1999</b>, a man was visited in 
          his home by a 7-foot-tall mantid.</p>

          <p><b>SARASOTA, FLORIDA</b>. In <b>1952</b>, a UFO skeptic changed his tune when a UFO 
          zigzagged over his home. In <b>1953</b>, two men had saw a UFO following several B36 
          aircraft, and then zoom towards them and hover overhead. In <b>January 1954</b>, 
          Pulitzer Prize-winning author, MacKinley Kantor saw a UFO and took it to the highest 
          levels of government. The years of <b>1957, 1958 and 1960</b> brought many undeniable 
          UFO encounters over the city. In <b>1969</b>, and again in <b>1976</b>, waves of 
          activity were viewed by many residents who were left with no explanation for what they 
          saw. In <b>1985</b>, authorities were flooded with calls as a wave of activity occurred 
          over the city, with some seeing an object diving into the bay. In <b>1995</b>, a pilot 
          and his passenger flying in their Cessna reported a near-collision with a bright 
          glowing object. In <b>1995</b>, residents of a home on the outskirts of Sarasota 
          discovered a strange glowing stone in their yard, which ended up causing severe 
          repercussions. In <b>1999 and 2005</b>, witnesses driving through the area saw UFOs at 
          treetop level moving overhead. In <b>2022</b>, a man not only saw a fleet of 8 disc-
          shaped objects, he took photographs!</p>

          <p>As can be seen, UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen all over this planet. This 
          is important as it reveals that the ETs appear to have an agenda to announce their 
          presence to all humanity. The ETs have done their part to disclose their presence. 
          The rest is up to us!</p>

          <h5>Apr 18, 2025 (1:13:01)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Joe Gardner (an artist from Huntington, West Virginia) 
          was five years old when he had his first strange encounter. It was <b>1974</b> and he 
          and his mother stood in the parking lot of the local Foodland grocery store. 
          Suddenly Joe heard a singsong voice speaks in his mind, “Joe-Joe. Joe-Joe.” 
          Looking up he saw a shiny metallic cylindrical object floating overhead. He 
          pointed it out to his mother who also saw it. So began Joe’s life of high 
          strangeness. Following this, he and his entire family had a dramatic missing 
          time encounter with a landed UFO. A few years later, Joe had another onboard 
          encounter. But for various reasons, both these events became buried in his mind 
          and shrouded in forgetfulness.</p>

          <p>Years later, on <b>January 22, 1997</b>, Joe (now 22) had a dramatic sighting of a green 
          orb arcing across the pre-dawn sky. Two years later, on the <b>night of April 7, 1999</b>, 
          he was walking his dog when a glittering diamond-shaped object appeared. Joe sent 
          out a telepathic message, “Who are you?” The response was instantaneous: “No, not 
          now!” Joe felt an overwhelming sense of love coming from the object. These two 
          sightings sent Joe on a journey of awakening and discovery. It was then that he 
          remembered the sighting at age five, and the two other major experiences that 
          followed.</p>

          <p>It was just a few months after the sighting at the Foodland grocery store that 
          Joe’s family (father, mother, sister and Joe) went for a blackberry hunting trip 
          into nearby Kentucky. It was early afternoon, and they drove along the backroads 
          when Joe’s father pointed out a weird-looking “spaceship house” sitting on stilts 
          a few hundred feet off the highway. It was shiny, metallic, with portholes around 
          the circumference. Joe begged his father to stop. They pulled off the road. Joe’s 
          father and Joe got out and walked up to the object. There was no driveway, no 
          telephone wires. Joe’s father knocked on the side of it, and suddenly an opening 
          appeared, an arm stuck and gestured, and voice said, “Up here!” At the time of the 
          incident, the next thing Joe and his father knew, they were back in the car, driving 
          home. But now, years later, Joe recalled that they actually went onboard.</p>

          <p>A small ladder came down and Joe and his father climbed up into the object. Joe 
          immediately saw a humanoid figure with a large bald head, huge darks eyes and a skinny 
          body. He looked more like a bug than a human, though his father didn’t seem to notice. 
          While the man and Joe’s father talked, the being motioned Joe to a table where there 
          were small black wafers and a tumbler filled with green liquid. Joe thought it was 
          chocolate cookies and juice and took a bite of the cookie. It was bitter, so he took 
          a sip of the juice and promptly passed out.</p>

          <p>Joe awoke to find himself lying on a metal table while his father sat on a small 
          bench, apparently in a trance. An unpleasant physical exam followed, and again, Joe 
          lost consciousness. He awoke to see a tall gray-type ET, who asked Joe if he’d like a 
          tour of the craft. Joe was taken to another room where he saw his family sitting 
          unmoving in separate chairs, with all kinds of activity going on around them. Becoming 
          upset, the gray told him, telepathically, not to be afraid, that it was just a checkup. 
          Reassured, the being then took Joe up to a room where he saw a field of stars.</p>

          <p>Joe’s next memory is being in the car driving home. His whole family was upset. His 
          father cursed angrily, and both his mother and sister were crying. When they arrived 
          home, they discovered they were missing almost ten hours. Joe was the only one who had 
          some recall of being taken onboard. After a visit by a Man in Black, Joe’s father 
          forbade him to talk about it ever again.</p>

          <p>Three years later, at age eight, Joe woke up in his bedroom to hear his name being 
          called inside his head. Looking outside, he saw a landed craft with a man on top. “Do 
          you want to go for a ride?” the man asked telepathically. Joe said yes, and he snuck 
          out of the house into the craft. He was met by a human-looking man in a jumpsuit who 
          took him to the control room, sat him in the seat and off they went, up over the city, 
          over the earth, and the next thing Joe knew, he was looking at the planet Saturn. The 
          experience was entirely benevolent. Returning Joe to his home, the man urged Joe to 
          study hard at school and tell nobody about the encounter.</p>

          <p>Now, as an adult, Joe began having many close-up UFO sightings and was able to take 
          photographs of a few of them. He learned his mom had a missing time encounter. He 
          experienced a wide variety of paranormal events, including another episode of 
          telepathic communication. Then on <b>April 3, 2007</b>, Joe had a truly bizarre 
          encounter with a blue-skinned humanoid that changed his entire outlook about his 
          experiences, and he wondered if perhaps they weren’t ETs at all, but more akin to 
          Djinns.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The general public has no idea how common humanoid encounters 
          are. There are not hundreds of cases, but many thousands, perhaps more than that. Cases go 
          back more than 100 years and come from across the world. The coverup is one reason cases 
          like these are thought of as rare. Another is that an encounter with a humanoid can be so 
          strange that people are reluctant to report it for fear of being disbelieved or ridiculed. 
          Still, many people have found the courage to come forward. Almost everything we know about 
          UFOs and ETs comes from these reports. This episode presents twelve cases from <b>1940-2013</b>, 
          occurring across the planet, involving a wide variety of humanoids.</p>
           
          <p><b>TALL HUMANOIDS IN GLOWING METALLIC OUTFITS</b>. Sometime in the <b>early 1940s</b>, 
          police sergeant Vicente Pedone was stationed in Oriente, Buenos Aires, Argentina when a 
          local resident reported a strange aircraft seemingly coming in for a crash-landing. 
          Going to investigate, they saw a landed craft with tall humanoids next to it. Fear soon 
          caused them to flee the scene.</p>

          <p><b>THE CLOUDED CRAFT</b>. Early one <b>night in 1952</b>, a group of stoneworkers 
          near the Nimes-Courbessac Airport in France saw a strange cloud approach. In moments, 
          it revealed itself to be a solid metallic craft with portholes. And through the 
          portholes they saw 5 or 6 figures inside. The craft darted away, again hidden by 
          clouds. Other people saw the object too.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO DRIVE-BY, WITH HUMANOIDS</b>. One <b>night in October 1957</b>, a couple 
          driving through the Store Vildmose Bog near Aalborg, Denmark saw a bright light zooming 
          towards them just above the ground. In moments, it was right next to them. They now saw 
          it was a craft with a glass-like dome on top, and seated inside were two uniformed men. 
          Afraid, the wife insisted they flee.</p>

          <p><b>THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE PEOPLE…BUT THEY WEREN’T</b>. At <b>9pm on December 18, 1977</b>, 
          Bruno Nygard was walking to his home in Sahavaara, Sweden and saw a strange craft 
          floating above the road. As it approached, he saw two short men sitting on top. The 
          two men hopped off and began picking up things from the road. Seeing Bruno, they hopped 
          back onto their ship and zoomed off.</p>

          <p><b>IT WAS NOT HUMAN</b>. On the <b>night of August 7, 1979</b>, two women driving 
          near Duluth, Minnesota saw three short figures on the road ahead of them. They appeared 
          at first to be children. Then two seemed to float off the road, but the third stood in 
          the road, blocking their way. The witnesses stopped their car and stared in shock: it 
          was not human. After 10 scary minutes, they drove off.</p>

          <p><b>NINE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS</b>. On <b>February 12, 1980</b>, during a wave of 
          sightings near Algeciras, Spain, a couple and three children drove up to where the 
          lights were being seen. They came upon a landed UFO and two 9-foot-tall humanoids. 
          When the figures began to approach, they fled in their car. To their shock, the 
          figures chased them in their car.</p>

          <p><b>REALLY SCARED, BUT ALSO CURIOUS</b>. One <b>summer evening in 1981</b>, a woman 
          was driving to her home in rural Utah when her car broken down. Walking the remaining 
          2 miles home, a UFO flew over her head then landed in the road in front of her. Out 
          stepped a little man. She approached and waved at the being. A bright light flashed, 
          and she fainted. When she awoke, the craft and humanoid were gone.</p>

          <p><b>IT WAS GONE WITHIN SECONDS</b>. In <b>August 1983</b>, a wave of UFO activity 
          struck central Puerto Rico. Many people had close-up sightings of strange craft. 
          Among the strangest was a man who saw a pyramid-shaped object. It had windows on one 
          side, and looking down at him were three humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOID</b>. One <b>spring day in 1984</b>, a young boy was 
          walking through a field near his home in Vancouver, Washington when he came upon a 
          3-foot-wide metallic disc with a clear dome on top. Inside it was a tiny humanoid. 
          The boy picked up the craft, which emitted a buzzing noise, broke free from his grip 
          and darted off into the sky.</p>
 
          <p><b>WHAT I SAW WAS FOUR FEET TALL</b>. Late one <b>night on March 20, 1997</b>, a man 
          from Port Perry, Ontario, Canada, was shocked to see grays inside his home. They had 
          skinny bodies and looked reptilian. One moved its arms up and down in slow motion. 
          The man thinks he may have had missing time.</p>

          <p><b>WE CAN FIND YOU</b>. One night in <b>mid-January 2007</b>, a man stepped out from 
          his work in New Orleans, Louisiana for a quick smoke. He heard an odd beeping noise. 
          Then a strange fear filled him and looking up, he saw a gray entity floating in the sky 
          above him.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE GRAY IN THE BEDROOM</b>. On <b>April 11, 2013</b>, a woman entered her parents’ 
          bedroom in Catania, Italy, and saw her mother levitating and a gray standing next to her. 
          Filled with fear, she ran into the bathroom and locked the door. Soon other odd events 
          began to occur.</p>
          
          <p>Twelve cases, each adding to the growing database of human encounters, each making 
          it increasingly difficult to deny the truth of the UFO phenomenon. Sooner or later, all 
          humanity will become aware that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

          from Port Perry, Ontario, Canada, was shocked to see grays inside his home. They had 
          skinny bodies and looked reptilian. One moved its arms up and down in slow motion. 
          The man thinks he may have had missing time.</p>

          <p><b>WE CAN FIND YOU</b>. One <b>night in mid-January 2007</b>, a man stepped out 
          from his work in New Orleans, Louisiana for a quick smoke. He heard an odd beeping 
          noise. Then a strange fear filled him and looking up, he saw a gray entity floating 
          in the sky above him.</p>

          <p><b>THE GRAY IN THE BEDROOM</b>. On <b>April 11, 2013</b>, a woman entered her 
          parents’ bedroom in Catania, Italy, and saw her mother levitating and a gray standing 
          next to her. Filled with fear, she ran into the bathroom and locked the door. Soon 
          other odd events began to occur.</p>

          <p>Twelve cases, each adding to the growing database of human encounters, each making 
          it increasingly difficult to deny the truth of the UFO phenomenon. Sooner or later, 
          all humanity will become aware that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to Episode Nine of UFOs in Your Hometown. Name 
          any town or city on this planet, and you will find a history of UFOs. So far I have 
          examined almost 100 locations, and every single one of them has been visited by UFOs. 
          The implications of this are profound; this shows that UFO encounters are far more 
          common than previously believed. It appears that the UFO occupants are conducting a 
          publicity campaign and want to be seen. This latest episode of the ongoing series 
          presents nine new locations including: Katwijk, Holland; Nanjing, China; Pakistan; 
          Quapaw, Oklahoma; Salinas, California; Dubque, Iowa; Daytona Beach, Florida; Statesville, 
          North Carolina; and Annadale, New York. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters 
          and more…they are occurring everywhere on Earth.</p>

          <p><b>KATWIJK, HOLLAND</b>. This small town of about twelve square miles has a couple 
          of very interesting encounters. At <b>3:30 am on July 8, 2003</b>, a woman noticed a 
          spinning disc-shaped craft over her home. It remained in place for an hour. Afterwards, 
          she had a terrible headache. On <b>September 2, 2023</b>, a witness not only saw a UFO, but 
          photographed and filmed it.</p>

          <p><b>NANJING, CHINA</b>. One of Nanjing’s earliest sightings occurred in <b>1892</b> and was 
          widely-viewed and memorialized in a painting. In <b>1999</b>, a glowing red cylindrical 
          object hovered for four hours over the city. In <b>2002</b>, three separate pilots 
          witnessed an unidentified craft moving through the skies. In <b>2009</b>, during a solar 
          eclipse, scientists observed and photographed a glowing object.</p>

          <p><b>PAKISTAN</b>. In <b>1952</b>, the Reuters News Service reported on a sighting in Karachi 
          involving four flying saucers. Per a CIA document, UFOs were seen in <b>1953</b>. In <b>1955</b>, 
          UFOs hovered over an airport. Also in <b>1955</b>, thousands of witnesses who saw a craft 
          with humanoids inside it. A sighting of a bright red disc occurred in <b>1956</b>, and in 
          <b>1969</b>, Army intelligence officers in Peshawar saw three discs in the sky. They were 
          sworn to silence. In <b>1986</b> a group of witnesses saw 8 objects. In <b>2002</b>, Pakistani 
          pilots had a close encounter with a UFO.</p>

          <p><b>QUAPAW, OKLAHOMA</b>. This tiny town is well-known for mysterious spook-lights. 
          It also has UFO encounters. In <b>1972</b>, a couple witnessed three UFOs hover over their 
          home for over an hour. In <b>2006</b>, a witness driving through Quapaw saw a silver cigar-
          shaped object hover and dart off at high speed. In <b>2014</b>, a witness saw a UFO so close, 
          he heard it humming.</p>

          <p><b>SALINAS, CALIFORNIA</b>. In <b>1945</b>, an army officer  at Salinas Army Airbase 
          saw three flying disks. In <b>1947</b>, a farmer saw a metallic disc-shaped craft in his 
          field. It was quickly nabbed by the US military. In <b>1950</b>, a mini-wave caused many 
          people to call the police. In <b>1950</b> and <b>1952</b>, a UFO hovered over two different 
          factories. In <b>1967</b>, a couple saw a  disc with portholes. In <b>1972</b>, a man saw a 
          gigantic UFO which prompted memories of being visited by humanoids. <b>1978</b> brought a 
          multi-witness case of UFOs over the airport; a 7-year-old who saw a UFO and had 
          missing time; five boys who had a close-up sighting; and a landing of a UFO at a 
          high school. Cases in 1981 and 2002 involved communication with the UFO occupants. 
          In <b>2013</b>, a filmed UFO sighting and crop circle brought wide publicity. More sightings 
          occurred in <b>2014</b> and in <b>2019</b>, a weird humanoid encounter.</p>

          <p><b>DUBUQUE, IOWA</b>. So many cases here! In <b>1880</b>, a woman claimed a bizarre 
          encounter with fairies. In <b>1947</b>, a couple saw metallic discs over their home. In 
          <b>1952</b>, a man had an odd encounter while driving outside the city. In <b>1960</b>, 
          a pilot filmed three UFOs over Dubuque. Many others saw the objects. In <b>1967</b> two 
          families saw an egg-shaped craft. More sightings occurred in <b>1972, 1977</b> and <b>1982</b>. 
          In <b>1996</b>, a teenage boy had a closeup UFO sighting and missing time. <b>2002</b> 
          brought two more sightings, including one by two pilots.</p>

          <p><b>DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA</b>. Sightings of metallic discs occurred in <b>1950</b> and 
          <b>1952</b>. In <b>1957</b>, a lady says a UFO paced her car. In <b>1959</b>, two pilots 
          had a near-collision with a UFO. In <b>1964</b>, a man saw a UFO with twelve humanoids 
          inside it. In <b>2008</b>, a father and son saw strange orbs hovering over the ocean. In 
          <b>2023</b>, a couple saw and filmed V-shaped craft over Daytona Beach.</p>

          <p><b>STATESVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA</b>. In <b>1955</b>, a trained observer saw three discs 
          cavorting playfully in the sky. In <b>1986</b>, a father and son saw a massive metallic 
          craft land in their corn field, and through the windows they could see many 
          humanoid figures.</p>

          <p><b>ANNADALE, NEW YORK</b>. In <b>1975</b> two boys walking in the forest saw a glowing object 
          hovering over some trees. Returning the next day, they found strange burn marks in 
          the trees. In <b>2004</b>, a young man saw a glowing sphere appearing and disappearing over 
          his home.</p>

          <p>Nine new locations: each with a history of UFO encounters. These encounters are 
          supported by multiple witnesses, landing traces, physiological effects, animal 
          reactions, photographs and more. The huge number of cases make it undeniable that 
          we are being visited.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The most extensive UFO encounter is being taken onboard an 
          extraterrestrial craft. This is the cutting edge of UFO research. These cases hold the 
          potential to answer the many questions surrounding ET contact: who are these visitors to 
          our planet, where do they come from, and why are they here? This video presents eight 
          amazing cases involving people who have been taken onboard a UFO and met aliens face-to-
          face.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE EARTH WILL ROLL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MARION FRANCIS</b>. At <b>12:30 pm 
          on Feb 10, 1969</b>, Marion Francis and her friend Jim Wells drove from Jacksonville, FL to 
          Daytona Beach. It should’ve taken one a half hours, but weirdly it took five. Marion suffered 
          from a bad headache, weakness and depression. Later, she went under hypnosis and recalled 
          being taken onboard a craft. She was examined by a gray ET. They showed her where they came 
          from, and said that Earth would one day tilt on its axis, and that the ETs would be there to 
          rescue those who are not afraid to go.</p>

          <p><b>DAZED AND CONFUSED IN A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSE PEREIRA SACRAMENTO</b>. 
          On the <b>night of May 20, 1969</b>, Jose Pereira Sacramento heard a noise outside his home 
          in Vila Operaria, Brazil. Going to investigate, he was shocked to see a UFO landing in his 
          backyard. He was suddenly pulled inside it where he met short beings standing in weird 
          cylinders, speaking an unknown language. He was frozen in place as the room filled with 
          painfully bright light. Suddenly he found himself back in bed. His eyes were badly inflamed, 
          and he suffered from lightheadedness for a full year.</p>

          <p><b>TRANSFORMED BY THE ETS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSEPH SUSEDIK</b>. On <b>May 26, 
          1974</b>, while camping at Mitchell Caverns in California, Joseph and his family saw a 
          UFO. That night, he was woken up by colored lights outside the trailer and found himself 
          immobilized. Upon awakening, he had vague memories of being taken somewhere. Later under 
          hypnosis, he recalled an onboard UFO encounter where ETs showed him the inside of the craft, 
          images of Saturn and various nebulae. Following this, Joseph became a prolific inventor, and 
          he and his wife pioneered the field of prenatal learning.</p>

          <p><b>PROBED BY ALIENS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JANET STEWART</b>. While driving to a 
          friend’s house in Bethel, Minnesota on the night of <b>Jan 6, 1976</b>, Janet was shocked 
          when a UFO paced her car. Picking up her friend, she also saw the UFO. Arriving home, 
          Janet was missing an hour of time, and had sore eyes. Under hypnosis, she recalled she 
          had been stopped by the UFO, and taken onboard. She was physically examined and 
          returned to her car. The encounter made, her a more easy-going, open-minded and 
          tolerant person.</p>

          <p><b>THERE ARE THINGS I STILL CANNOT TELL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF NESTOR URRUTI</b>. 
          On the <b>morning of May 14, 1976</b>, Nestor Urruti was driving through Olivarria, 
          Argentina when a UFO pulled him onboard with his truck. He found himself sitting in 
          front of a horseshoe-shaped panel with odd symbols. A telepathic voice told him that 
          one day the ETs will reveal themselves to the world. He then found himself back in 
          his truck. He was badly traumatized and had to be hospitalized.</p>

          <p><b>YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE THINGS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DOROTHY Y</b>. On <b>Sept 
          15, 1976</b>, Dorothy was awakened by bright lights outside her home in New London, MO. 
          Going outside, she saw short strange beings. Suddenly, she was in bed and it was the 
          next morning. Later under hypnosis, she was taken onboard and recalled being physically 
          examined. The ETs told her that she would being to see things: a prediction which turned 
          out to be true when she began having psychic visions of disasters.</p>

          <p><b>A JOURNEY ONBOARD A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF VICTOR AND BORIS</b>. In 
          <b>July 1986</b>, while hiking in the woods outside of Shenkursk, Russia, Victor and 
          Boris, came upon a strange craft and two human-looking men in jumpsuits. The men invited 
          Victor and Boris onboard. So began an amazing journey where the two witnesses were flown 
          across Europe. They asked many questions of the strange men. At one point, one of the ETs 
          allowed Victor to pilot the craft. They were then returned back to the forest, amazed by 
          their encounter.</p>

          <p><b>A FIGHT WITH STRANGE HUMANOIDS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROLF FULLER</b>. On 
          <b>July 25, 1992</b>, Rolf was amazed to see a UFO outside his family’s home in Tuttlingen, 
          Germany. That night, he woke up to find himself inside a UFO, confronted by short ETs with 
          large eyes. Rolf fought with the ETs. Suddenly, he was knocked unconscious. He woke up back 
          in bed and to his shock, the humanoids were still there!</p>

          <p>Eight onboard cases, each with details which are remarkably similar and confirm each 
          other’s accounts, and each with unique details that show how much we still have to learn. 
          What these cases do show is that people all over the world are being taken onboard 
          extraterrestrial craft and meeting extraterrestrials face-to-face. It has been happening 
          for a long time.</p>

          <h5>Mar 14, 2025 (0:36:02)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A teacher from Virginia, Sondra came from a military family 
          and has lived in many locations on the planet. She was born in 1940, and like many ET 
          contactees, unusual events surrounded her from a very young age. In fact, when she was 
          only a few weeks old, her mother woke up one morning to see Sondra levitating above her 
          crib! Soon other mystical events occurred. At age three, while living in sunny Long Beach 
          in southern California, Sondra discovered that she was able to call forth the wind, and 
          even make it snow.</p>

          <p>In <b>1946</b>, Sondra’s father (now an  attaché to a Navy Admiral) moved the family to 
          Tsingtao, China where they lived in the former Swiss Embassy building. There Sondra 
          soon displayed other abilities. She began having out-of-body experiences. Fresh-cut 
          flowers would remain alive and healthy in her room for weeks on end. She began to 
          hear a voice in her head teaching her about the human body. She excelled academically 
          to a degree that should would soon skip grades in school, and more. Her stay in China 
          was cut short by conflict within the country, and in <b>1947</b>, her father was called to 
          serve in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was there that Sondra had perhaps the most 
          unusual event of her life.</p>

          <p>Sondra had just turned eight-year-old and one day, with her parents’ permission, she 
          decided to ride her bicycle to a friend’s home one mile away. This was something she had 
          done many times, but on this occasion, she never made it there. When she did not arrive, 
          her family began a 7-hours-long frantic search for Sondra, finally finding her dazed and 
          in a trance alongside the remote highway near her home, in an area where they had already 
          searched several times. They asked her what happened, but Sondra did not dare tell them. 
          She knew they would never believe her.</p>

          <p>As she biked down the desolate highway, a shadow appeared overhead, and looking up, 
          she saw a metallic craft hover overhead. It quickly landed on the road in front of her. 
          Sondra stopped and watched as an opening appearing in the craft, and standing in the 
          doorway was a tall humanoid praying mantis beckoning her inside the craft. More 
          curious than afraid, Sondra approached. That mantis being told Sondra to have no 
          fear, that she was her mother and invited her onboard the craft. Fascinated, Sondra 
          accepted the offer.</p>

          <p>Entering the craft, she was shocked to see that it was much larger on the inside than 
          the outside. Immediately a half-dozen short little figures crowded around her, playfully 
          touching her blond hair and escorting her around the craft. She first thought they were 
          little children, but saw that they had large bald heads, big dark eyes, and gray skin. 
          Sondra explored the craft which was very sparse. Looking out a porthole, she was shocked 
          to see the Earth off in the distance. The mantis being led her to the center of the room 
          where there was a holographic device displaying full-color, three-dimensional images. 
          Sondra was shocked and saddened to see images of soldiers, tanks, explosions and more. 
          The mantis said, “What you are seeing are pictures of future wars,” and told Sondra that 
          it was her duty to warn others about this.</p>

          <p>After a few more messages, Sondra suddenly found herself back in her home with her 
          concerned parents. Sondra later told her grandmother who shared that she also had 
          encounters as a little girl, but otherwise learned to keep her experience a secret.</p>

          <p>Sondra grew up, got a few college degrees, fell in love, got married and had children. 
          She continued to have OBEs and other unusual events. Then one day her husband said he had 
          seen grays at the foot of the bed speaking to Sondra. She had no memory of this, but shortly 
          later, she began having repeated visitations by the grays in her bedroom, who would hold 
          long conversations with her. The visits occurred for many years. Only a few times did Sondra 
          ever see them arrive or leave. She rarely remembered the content of the conversations.</p>

          <p>Eventually the visits slowed and one day stopped. One of her final visits occurred in 
          2018. The grays had come to again give her in urgent warning about future wars on our 
          planet, and advise her to move out of the city and into the mountains, a warning which 
          she and her husband heeded. Today, she lives there peacefully. Sondra agreed to share her 
          story as she feels its important to communicate the warnings given to her by the ETs. If 
          you are interested in hearing more about Sondra’s amazing encounter, her story (and many 
          others) is presented in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Humanoids-High-Strangeness-Twenty-Encounters/dp/B0CDDXY41D"

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There is nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a 
          humanoid creature. An experience like this almost always has a profound effect on the 
          witness, challenging them mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It is something they 
          remember for the rest of their lives. Encounters like these are far more common than 
          you might think, and involve a mind-boggling variation of humanoid types. Here are 
          ten little-known cases coming from across the planet, each involving different humanoid 
          creatures, from tiny beings less than a foot tall, to creatures upwards of twelve feet 
          in height. Several involve multiple witnesses, not to mention landing traces, 
          electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and medical effects.</p>

          <p><b>A SIX-INCH HUMANOID</b>. On <b>April 20, 1945</b>, an anonymous priest was picking 
          edible mushrooms in the forest near Reneve, France when he saw a 6-inch-tall little man 
          wearing a full-body jumpsuit and carrying a little rod strapped to his back. The 
          stunned priest wanted to capture the little man, but it quickly ran off into the 
          bushes.</p>

          <p><b>I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT</b>. One <b>day in Spring of 1957</b>, two 
          9-year-old boys were playing in a field near their homes in Taboada, Spain when 
          movement caught their eye. Looking up, they saw a row of helmeted humanoids walking 
          through the wall of house and up into the air where they promptly disappeared.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN AT THE FRONT DOOR</b>. On the <b>night of August 31, 1968</b>, a lady 
          heard a loud knock on the front door of her home in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. Opening 
          the curtain, she saw a strange man, nearly 7 feet tall with a bald head, no ears, and 
          glowing eyes, wearing a shiny black jumpsuit. She was paralyzed in fear as the man 
          moved off, laughing.</p>

          <p><b>ETS INVESTIGATE FARMHOUSE</b>. On <b>February 6, 1969</b>, Jose Antonio Fioco was 
          working at a farm in Pirassununga, Brazil when a UFO landed on the property. Three 
          humanoids appeared, one sending down a beam of light on the chicken coop. This was just 
          the first of many encounters in the area, including another landing witnessed by a crowd 
          of people.</p>

          <p><b>TWO HUMAN-LIKE FIGURES</b>. One <b>night in January 1974</b>, a father and son 
          were woken up when their home in Pjedsted, Denmark filled with light. Looking outside, 
          they saw a saucer-shaped craft and two humanoids looking straight down at them. So 
          began a 5-minute-long staring contest which ended only as the craft moved away.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE FOREST</b>. Going into woods to train his dog around <b>midnight 
          on January 4, 1977</b>, an auto-worker from Carapito, Portugal came upon a large saucer-
          shaped craft with a humanoid standing below it. After a few moments, the craft 
          and humanoid disappeared, but researchers later found landing traces at the site.</p>

          <p><b>THE GIANT GLOWING FIGURE</b>. At <b>10pm on night in November 1977</b>, John and 
          Gail Weldon drove along a rural road in the Megalong Valley in NSW, Australia when a 
          gigantic glowing figure upwards of 12-feet in height strode towards their car. This is 
          just one of several dramatic UFO incidents in this area.</p>

          <p><b>WHAT BEAUTIFUL EYES</b>. One <b>night in May 1991</b>, KT, a lady living in an 
          apartment in the small town of Istok, Russia kept hearing strange footsteps. Finally she 
          was confronted by a gray-type ET with huge dark beautiful eyes. Later, investigators 
          learned that other people in the building reported strange events, including seeing a 
          UFO that very night.</p>

          <p><b>TWO VERY STRANGE HUMANOIDS</b>. One <b>night in Winter 1994</b>, two young men 
          were riding a motorbike on a rural road outside Musei, Italy when they came upon a 
          1-foot-tall humanoid with large eyes and pointing ears crossing the road in front of 
          them. Years earlier, the witness and his family had an even more frightening encounter 
          with a winged humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>EYES LIKE A FLY</b>. Hearing a strange beeping noise late on the <b>night of May 
          10, 1995</b>, a teenage boy exited the bedroom of his home in Columbia, Missouri and was 
          terrified to see a 4-foot-tall gray alien staring at him through the living room glass 
          door only three feet away.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE RAIN</b>. One <b>night in October 1995</b>, two 13-year-old girls 
          were horseback riding through the woods near their homes in Breitbrunn, Germany. Without 
          warning, they came upon a dome-shaped silver saucer covered with colored lights sitting 
          on the ground, and next to it were little “munchkin-sized” humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>CHARGED BY AN ALIEN</b>. Around <b>7:30 pm one evening in July 2018</b>, “Jacob” 
          was playing in the yard of his grandparents' home in a rural and isolated area of Newaygo, 
          Michigan. Movement behind a tree caught his eye. To his shock, a tall, skinny creature 
          with a big bald head, large eyes and gray skin crawled out, stood up and stared, then 
          suddenly charged right at him.</p>

          <p>These twelve cases offer a brief glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face 
          unearthly encounter with strange humanoids. These cases show how scary and traumatic an 
          encounter can be, and make it clear that we still have a lot to learn about who is 
          walking among us on this planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It’s the coldest, windiest, driest, highest and most remote 
          place on Earth. Its average temperature is 50-70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. It has 
          no permanent residents. It contains up to 90 percent of the world’s freshwater. It 
          covers 5.5 million square miles, about 98 percent of which is covered with ice. This 
          is, of course, Antarctica. Nobody owns it. The 1951 Antarctic treaty outlawed ownership, 
          and limits its use to peaceful, scientific research.</p>
          
          <p>Each year, 1000-5000 scientists and military officers are stationed at the various 
          bases. About 40,000 tourists visit there yearly. As with the Arctic, conspiracies abound, 
          from secret Nazi bases, to an entrance to the hollow Earth. True or not, what is undeniably 
          true is that the Antarctic has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. This video 
          presents twelve cases of UFOs in Antarctica. They reach back 75 years and include sightings, 
          landings, and humanoids. A few represent some of the best-verified UFO encounters in the 
          history of ufology.</p>

          <p><b>WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS TO PROVE WHAT WE SAW</b>. While at the Chilean base, Arturo 
          Prat, on <b>February 23, 1948</b> Captain Augusto Vars Orrego of the Chilean Navy says 
          that “During the bright Antarctic night, we saw flying saucers, one above the other, 
          turning at tremendous speeds. We have photographs to prove what we saw.” Sadly, the 
          photos were never released.</p>

          <p><b>THE COLD SCRUTINY OF UNKNOWN EYES</b>. On <b>January 8, 1956</b>. Four Chilean 
          scientists stationed at Robertson Island in the Weddell Sea saw two metallic cigar-shaped 
          objects hovering in a vertical position overhead. Thus began an hours-long encounter 
          during which their Geiger counter went off. They took many photographs, but again, the 
          photos have never been released.</p>

          <p><b>I’M ASHAMED TO SAY I PANICKED</b>. On <b>December 11, 1958</b>, McMurdo Sound Base, 
          AQI Roger Benson was driving a snow-tractor outside the base when he came upon a landed 
          UFO and a strange humanoid. He drove away in fear. At that time, a wave of sightings swept 
          the area, many of which were caught on radar. Rear Admiral Dufek, then in charge of the 
          base said, “I believe in UFOs.”</p>

          <p><b>A POLISHED GOLD SURFACE</b>. On <b>June 7, 1962</b>, Navy scientists at Hallett 
          Station saw a brilliant golden disc in the sky. They were able to use binoculars to discern 
          the disc-shape of a solid object. Despite this, Project Blue Book labeled the case as the 
          sighting of Jupiter.</p>

          <p><b>UFO INVESTIGATES NUCLEAR TEST</b>. On <b>July 9, 1962</b>, the US detonated a 1.45 
          megaton in space 250 miles over Johnson Atoll, blowing out Earth’s magnetic field for 30 
          seconds, knocking out several satellites, and damaging the electric grid. Following the 
          explosion, an expedition in Antarctica viewed a massive UFO heading to the area of the 
          explosion.</p>

          <p><b>UFOs TAKE CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT</b>. On <b>April 20, 1964</b>, a C-130 flight near 
          McMurdo Station lost power. Nine UFOs showed up and held the plane aloft for many miles. 
          The crew took 9 rolls of film. The strangest part of the encounter happened when the plane 
          landed and the crew unloaded the equipment, which weighed far less than it should.</p>

          <p><b>UFO WAVE OVER DECEPTION ISLAND</b>. In <b>June and July of 1965</b>, a wave of UFO 
          sightings swept over the military and scientific bases stationed on Deception Island. With 
          hundreds of observations by trained observers, recorded with a variety of scientific 
          instrumentation, including photos, the wave represents undeniable evidence of UFO reality.</p>

          <p><b>THE BUZZING CLOUD</b>. <b>On May 22, 1966</b>, a British survey team at Mount Gaudry 
          observed a strange cloud-like object sending a beam down to the ground, and moving in ways 
          that ruled out conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon.</p>

          <p><b>UFO OVER VOLCANIC ERUPTION</b>. On <b>December 4, 1967</b>, a volcanic eruption at 
          Mount Deception forced an emergency evacuation and destroyed both the British and Chilean 
          stations located there. Incredibly, a photo captured not only the disaster, but what appears 
          to be a UFO.</p>

          <p><b>ANTARCTICA UFO CRASH</b>. Reports of UFO crashes abound and there is at least one in 
          Antarctica. Although not well-verified, reportedly in <b>October 1982</b> when an expedition 
          searching for meteorites allegedly came upon a crashed craft and five ET bodies.</p>

          <p><b>THEY’RE DOING THE STRANGEST THING</b>. Per Linda Moulton Howe, in <b>1983</b> (date 
          approx.) “Brian,” claims that while based at McMurdo he was on a flight over the 
          Transantarctic Mountains when they encountered a group of UFOs on maneuvers, one of 
          several strange events he experienced.</p>

          <p><b>AN ENORMOUS CIRCLE OF LIGHT</b>. In <b>April 1991</b>, scientists at the Argentinian 
          General San Martin Base received anomalous readings on their scientific instrumentation 
          indicating the presence of a large power source overhead. Hours later, one of the men made 
          a visual observation of a massive object.</p>

          <p>With so many encounters, observed by so many trained scientists, verified by such a 
          wide variety of scientific instruments and photographed, there is only one possible 
          conclusion: the Antarctic is being visited by UFOs.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The Arctic has always been a place of mystery and wonder. 
          The magical Northern Lights, a rich wildlife of polar bears, seals, foxes and more, 
          surviving in one of the most inhospitable locations on our planet, continue to capture 
          our imagination. Speculation and conspiracies about the Arctic abound. But what is the 
          truth? Have UFOs been seen there? The answer of course is yes!</p>

          <p>The Arctic Circle is 9,900 miles in circumference. Only 8 countries are located within 
          this area, and yet it encompasses about 7.7 million miles. It also has a rich, varied 
          history of UFO encounters reaching back to 1850 continuing up to the current day. This 
          video presents 25 of the best-verified and most fascinating accounts from the Arctic 
          Circle.  These cases involve sightings, landings, humanoids and even an apparent UFO 
          crash!</p>

          <p><b>TWO UNKNOWN OBJECTS</b>. In <b>1850</b>, the crew of a ship sailing the Wellington 
          Channel observed a mysterious glowing object.</p>

          <p><b>AN EERIE EVENT</b>. In <b>1912</b>, the Russian Ship, Saint Anna became icebound in 
          the Arctic for two years. On <b>November 8, 1913</b>, they had a remarkable sighting of a 
          red glowing object.</p>

          <p><b>ESKIMO VILLAGE DISAPPEARS</b>. In <b>1930</b>, trapper Joe Labelle went to Lake 
          Angikuni, Canada to trade with the local village, only to find that everyone was gone. 
          But where did they go?</p>

          <p><b>THE WATCHING GLOBES</b>. During WWII, four ships in a convoy in the Norwegian Sea

          his work in Alaska with Project Ptarmigan, many officers had incredible encounters with 
          UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>“IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE ENTIRE POPULATION.”</b> In <b>August 1950</b>, resident of 
          an arctic village and Russian aviators observe glowing discs in the sky for three days in 
          a row.</p>

          <p><b>THE SPITSBERGEN ISLAND UFO CRASH</b>. In <b>May 1952</b>, a disc with UFO occupants

          <p><b>EXTREME ALTITUDE ARCTIC OBJECT</b>. In <b>November 1958</b>, a US radar station 
          detects an object hovering above the Arctic Circle.</p>

          <p><b>A DISC LANDS AT UMIAT</b>. In <b>1958-1959</b> a wave of sightings in the Arctic 
          Circle caused concern within Finland and the Soviet Union. One case involved a landing 
          at Umiat, Alaska.</p>

          <p><b>NOTHING ON EARTH</b>. On <b>March 16, 1961</b>, the crew of the USS Glacier 
          observed “strange luminous aerial phenomenon.”</p>

          <p><b>A PEARL-COLORED DISC</b>. In <b>February 1967</b>, pilots over Tiksi, Siberia saw 
          a pearl-colored disc-shaped craft overtake their plane.</p>

          <p><b>DISCONCERTINGLY CAPTIVATING, DEEPLY PROVOCATIVE, UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE</b>. On 
          <b>August 22, 1967</b>, Soviet journalist Alfred Tulchensky had a closeup sighting of a 
          metallic disc over the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia.</p>

          <p><b>AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED TO ME ON MY WAY TO THE NORTH POLE</b>. On <b>March 
          1, 1968</b>, while flying over the Arctic Circle, reporter Sally Remaley and others saw 
          a group of six craft landed on the frozen tundra.</p>

          <p><b>ESKIMOS OBSERVE UFO LANDING</b>. On <b>August 16-17, 1972</b> a wave of sightings 
          occurred over St. Michael, Alaska, including a UFO landing.</p>

          <p><b>ARCTIC OCEAN UFO</b>. On <b>October 16, 1976</b>, the crew of a small boat in 
          the Arctic Sea had a close-up encounter with a glowing disc.</p>

          <p><b>AN EERIE APPEARANCE</b>. On <b>October 22, 1980</b>, a Soviet Air Force Pilot saw

          Canada are paced in their car by two metallic craft.</p>

          <p><b>WE’RE USED TO IT</b>. For <b>two weeks in December 2002</b>, UFOs appeared so 
          regularly over Noorvik, Alaska that residents saw them nightly.</p>

          <p>These 25 cases are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to UFOs seen within the 
          Arctic Circle. Cases likely number in the thousands. Because the Arctic is so remote and 
          uninhabited, most activity likely goes unobserved by human eyes.</p>

          <p>There are now enough cases to prove that UFOs and ETs are visiting the Arctic.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Healing is a major part of the extraterrestrial agenda. 
          There are more than 300 cases coming from major researchers across the world 
          including Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John Mack, Barbara Lamb, Edith Fiore, 
          Timothy Good, Brad Steiger and more. People are being cured of a wide variety of 
          injuries, illnesses, and conditions. Accounts reach back more than 100 years up to 
          the present day. They can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Most cases occur 
          onboard UFOs or in a person’s home, but a small portion of cases occur in a place 
          you would never expect: inside a hospital. It may sound incredible, but almost ten 
          percent of UFO healing cases fit this category. This video presents 17 cases of 
          this kind, which are only a small portion of the actual number of cases.</p>

          <p><b>MY SIGHT RESTORED</b>. <b>April 1945</b>, Okinawa Island. After being struck by 
          shrapnel in his eye and suffering an eye infection that rendered him blind, Howard 
          Menger is visited in his hospital tent and healed.</p>

          <p><b>EYES FILLED WITH GREAT COMPASSION</b>. <b>June 1946</b>, Camp Lee, VA. Allan

          <h5>Feb 7, 2025 (1:16:05)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">For many people, a humanoid encounter is one of the most 
          shocking and incredible experiences of their lives. When someone experiences something 
          that is completely foreign to their worldview, it can be incredibly difficult to 
          understand and process. An encounter can be so shocking that it becomes almost 
          impossible to speak about it.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents ten very close encounters with humanoids, several of which only 
          became investigated through fortuitous circumstances. Many of these involve multiple 
          witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence such as landing traces, animal 
          reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO NEXT DOOR</b>. On the <b>night of May 5, 1952</b>, Ann L Sohn (a nurse) 
          looked out the window of her home in Prospect Park, Illinois and saw a massive, saucer-
          shaped craft. Through the portholes, Ann saw humanoids looking down at her. After a few 
          moments, the craft darted away. Later, Ann learned that other people in the area saw UFOs 
          on that same night. And the plants where the craft had hovered died.</p>

          <p><b>A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED</b>. On the <b>night of December 9, 1960</b>, Madame 
          Dhelens looked out the window of her home in Carignan, France and saw an oval-shaped craft 
          landed in the yard. Inside, she saw movement through a few portholes. It quickly rose up 
          and darted away. Unknown to her, several people in the area also saw it. The next day, a 
          circle of yellowed grass was found where the craft had landed.</p>

          <p><b>THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE</b>. On the <b>night of March 20, 1967</b>, 
          Jim Rible and his daughter Jean decided to take a drive to investigate weird lights in the 
          sky that Jim’s wife had seen near their home in Butler, Pennsylvania. They saw the lights, 
          but then the lights zoomed at them. Jean heard voices speaking to her mentally. Then five 
          beings appeared in front of their car. It scared them so bad, they fled the scene.</p>
 
          <p><b>THE MAN ON THE FLYING BOX</b>. At <b>5:30 pm one night in November 1974</b>, Giovanna 
          Sensoli was at her farm in Case di Mordano, Italy when her animals acted crazily. Looking 
          up, she saw a man in a jumpsuit straddling a floating box-shaped craft and looking down at 
          her. A short distance away a brilliant object hung in the sky. Giovanna watched in amazement 
          as it moved off and seemed to land in a nearby cemetery.</p>

          <p><b>A ROBOTIC BEING</b>. At <b>1:30 am in mid-September 1977</b>, Luis Almeida was 
          watering the garden behind his home in Gondomar, Portugal when a bright light shone on 
          him from behind the brick wall bordering his property. Looking up, he was shocked to see 
          that the light was coming from a gray, metallic, robot-looking figure at least 6 feet 
          tall. Terrified, he ran inside, and was so traumatized, he couldn’t talk about it.</p>

          <p><b>THE DAY THE ETS CAME TO VISIT</b>. It was the <b>night of November 2, 1977</b> as 
          16-year-old LC watched TV in his aunt’s house in Joaquin Murtinho, Brazil. Suddenly a 
          metallic orb entered his home. A tall man dressed in a jumpsuit and two other figures 
          appeared. Going outside, he saw a craft in the backyard. The ETs spoke to him 
          telepathically, gave him predictions, then entered their craft and departed.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN AND THE FISHERMEN</b>. On the <b>night of February 4, 1978</b>, six men 
          fishing on Lake La Florida in San Luis, Argentina got the shock of their life when a 
          saucer appeared overhead and released a tall, fair-haired, human-looking man dressed in 
          a silver suit and transparent helmet. The man walked up to them, smiled, made a gesture 
          of friendship, and left. The being left footprints in the ground, and others saw the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>THE SINGING EXTRATERRESTRIALS</b>. On <b>February 1982</b>, two men were in the 
          area of Borok, Russia to take photos of monuments when they came upon a landed craft. Two 
          humanoids in jumpsuits emerged. One of the men became entranced and immobilized, but the 
          other remained awake as the beings approached and communicated to him with harmonic tones. 
          They left after a few minutes, but the witness’s life was changed forever.</p>

          <p><b>IT WAS STRANGE</b>. One night in <b>August of 1983</b>, four 12-year-old boys were 
          playing in the woods outside their homes in Opole, Poland. Suddenly a thick fog appeared. 
          Moments later, a craft landed right in front of them. They saw two humanoids exit and run 
          by them into the forest. They gave chase but the ETs eluded them. The craft took off leaving 
          behind undeniable landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>“HUMANS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE.”</b> On <b>March 26, 2002</b>, an anonymous 
          salesman was driving outside Cazalla de la Sierra, Spain when a pear-shaped craft blocked 
          the road ahead. Looking into the field, he saw two very tall humanoids in jumpsuits. He 
          exited his car and spoke with one of the beings who was very friendly and told him that 
          Earth was a very beautiful place.</p>

          <p>These ten cases are just a small portion of the actual number of cases, and yet they 
          each provide amazing insights about ET contact. There are now enough documented cases 
          to conclude that we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are being seen all over this planet. To prove this 
          fact, I put out a challenge: name any town or city, and I will find an encounter 
          there. And I have! I have explored almost 100 towns and cities and every one of them 
          has a history of UFO encounters. Not just sightings, but landings, face-to-face 
          meetings with humanoids, onboard encounters and even UFO crashes.</p>
          
          <p>In this latest episode, we explore eight new places including, Albion, MI; Austin, 
          TX; Leesville, LA; Whittier, CA; Huntsville, AL; Elkton, MD; Seoul, South Korea and 
          finally, Oshkosh, WI. These cases reach back decades and have lots of evidence: photos, 
          radar-returns, landing traces, animal reactions, medical effects, and even metal 
          fragments. We are not alone!</p>

          <p><b>ALBION, MICHIGAN</b>. In 1967, Charles W. Smith encountered a UFO which told him 
          telepathically to talk to his priest. Two sightings later, Charles told his priest who 
          turned out to have a close UFO connection himself. Later, Charles encountered a landed 
          UFO with humanoids. In 1973, numerous police in Albion reported UFOs. In 1980, the Shive 
          family described their harrowing encounter with a UFO that stalled their van on a lonely 
          road at night. Even as late as 2007 UFOs continued to visit Albion.</p>

          <p><b>AUSTIN, TEXAS</b>. This large city has a rich UFO history. In 1950, three men saw 
          a craft hover over downtown. In 1971, a craft landed in a lady’s front-yard and out 
          stepped three humanoids. In 1974, Ray Stanford and his team captured an amazing long-
          exposure photo. In 1977, Ray had his own daylight sighting. In 1988, three men came upon 
          a landed disc and humanoids; they all had missing time. More incredible encounters 
          occurred throughout the 2000s, including UFOs captured on videotape.</p>

          <p><b>LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA</b>. On April 12, 1960, a UFO was seen and heard by dozens 
          of people as it moved overhead and exploded into the ground before flying off. It left 
          behind landing traces and metal fragments. Project Blue Book wrote an 80-page report on 
          the case which remains unsolved. In 1975, a mother and her son had a very close-up 
          encounter with a disc-shaped craft. In 1996, UFOs over the town generated numerous calls 
          to radio stations and newspapers reporting strange lights over the town.</p>

          <p><b>WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA</b>. In 1957, people across Whittier saw up to six saucer-
          shaped craft hovering and maneuvering overhead. In 1966, a car was chased for many miles 
          by a craft. In 1967, two men had a close-up sighting of a metallic craft with portholes 
          hovering over their front yard. On the night of March 23, 1977 when dozens of police and 
          military officers sighted UFOs over a wide area for nine hours! In 1978, a lady saw a 
          craft over the freeway.</p>

          <p><b>HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA</b>. In 1950, two men saw a metallic craft over the city. Two 
          sightings occurred in 1952, both with many witnesses. In 1975, a man followed a UFO in 
          his car into the woods and had two hours of missing time. In 1981, a woman had had an 
          onboard experience involving a strange humanoid. That same year, another man reported 
          his encounter with a giant craft. In 1988, a craft rose out of Gunterville Lake. It 
          followed them home. In 2023, a witness captured photo of UFOs over the city.</p>

          <p><b>ELKTON, MARYLAND</b>. In 1971, a family and other witnesses encountered two UFOs 
          while driving into Elkton. In 1988, a family driving into Elkton were followed by a UFO 
          and had three hours of missing time. In 1993, two boaters on the Elk River had a bizarre 
          encounter with a USO. That same year, a man had a scary encounter that resulted in hours 
          of missing time. In 1994, a witness had a scary encounter with a saucer hovering over a 
          field. And in 2012, an Elkton man reported a missing time encounter.</p>

          <p><b>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA</b>. So many cases! In 1970, seven military officers and many 
          residents saw a silver disc move overhead. In 1951, fighter pilots observed green 
          spheres which were also caught on radar. Sightings occurred throughout the 1950s, some 
          of which were also caught on radar. In 1979, a soldier stationed at Kunsan Airbase says 
          a humanoid entered his barracks. In 1981 and 1982 there were two sightings of a cone-
          shaped UFO.  From 1995-2012, three cases occurred, all involving photos!</p>

          <p><b>OSHKOSH, WISCONSIN</b>. Way back in 1886, at midday, a darkness settled over 
          Oshkosh causing a city-wide panic. In 1947, three witnesses came upon a hovering craft 
          with humanoids looking out the window. In 1956, a group of children had two sightings 
          of UFOs on one day. In 1979, many people called the police reporting a red UFO which 
          apparently crashed into the ground. In 2012, people over a wide area reported strange 
          lights in the sky. In 2022, a UFO was captured on photograph over the suburbs.</p>

          <p>So many cases involving close encounters of the first, second and third kind. Too many 
          cases to deny or explain away. The only alternative is that these cases are true; we are 
          being visited by extraterrestrials. It doesn’t matter where you live on Earth, UFOs have 
          been there!</p>

          STORY OF MIKE W</a></h2>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Jan 24, 2025 (0:49:54)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">People across the world are reporting direct contact with 
          UFOs and extraterrestrials. Cases reach back more than 100 years and number in the many 
          thousands, or as some researcher believe, in the millions. Researchers have discovered 
          that contact is often generational, following certain family lines. As a general rule, 
          it begins in early childhood and continues throughout a person’s life.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents the contact experiences of Mike W, a retired apartment manager 
          originally from Norman, Oklahoma. His encounters include events that are both typical 
          and commonly reported, as well as unique elements of extreme high strangeness.</p>

          <p>Born in <b>1945</b>, Mike’s experiences began in the <b>early 1950s</b>. Around age 
          five, Mike would periodically and inexplicably disappear from his home. His parents and 
          family would search for him, and find him sometimes miles from their home on a random 
          street corner. Mike has no memories of these missing time encounters, but his parents 
          assured him that it happened many times. Around that time, his parents extracted what 
          appeared to be a strange, tiny, ceramic rod from his arm. In hindsight, Mike wonders, 
          could this have been an alien implant?</p>

          <p>Years passed with no unusual experiences. Mike moved to Portland, Oregon. And on 
          <b>May 11, 1970</b>, Mike (now 25 years old) had a series of three consecutive encounters 
          on that day that would leave him baffled for the rest of his life. The first occurred while 
          walking down the sidewalk in downtown Portland, near the local University where a 
          series of anti-war protests had escalated to riots that would garner national headlines. 
          Mike noticed two seven-foot-tall, identical-looking gentleman wearing dark suits walking 
          towards him. They confronted him and told him, “We can take you anytime we feel like it.” 
          A short conversation followed, and the men identified themselves as CIA agents. Mike 
          didn’t believe them, but shocked and afraid, he turned and ran.</p>

          <p>Later that night, he was walking down Jefferson Street when he saw a crowd of people 
          watching a fight in front of a bar. Mike’s attention was drawn to two tall, identical-
          looking gentlemen standing behind the crowd observing intently. The two men were seven 
          feet tall, dressed identically in ankle-length brown robes and golden Nefertiti-like 
          headwear. Also odd was that nobody seemed to notice them. Even stranger, they held 
          their hands out in a peculiar way. Curious about their weird appearance and behavior, 
          Mike stood next to them and asked them what they were doing. One of them replied that 
          they were reading people’s minds to determine what was going on. Mike offered to 
          investigate for them and almost ended up getting involved in the bar fight. When he 
          turned around, the men were gone. Only then did he wonder, were they the same men who 
          had confronted him earlier?</p>

          <p>Walking back home, he had his third and strangest encounter. An attractive woman 
          dressed in the same kind of ankle-length brown robe approached him and said, “I need to 
          have sex with you.” It was an offer Mike couldn’t resist, and he took the woman home. 
          Making love, he was shocked to find that the woman’s anatomy had some profoundly strange 
          abnormalities. Her skin seemed rubbery. She began to communicate to him telepathically. 
          And at one point, he looked at her and was shocked to see that she appeared to be bald. 
          After being intimate, she left without a word and was gone. After thinking about it and 
          the other two encounters, he began to wonder if all three encounters were connected, and 
          were the people he had seen even human?</p>

          <p>Years later, <b>one night in 1988</b>, Mike (now living in northern California) went up to 
          the mountains overlooking the San Francisco Bay to play with his ham radio. Shortly after 
          parking, he realized a brilliant light was shining down on him. Exiting his car, he 
          turned and saw a gigantic craft hovering right above a hill a short distance away. It was 
          not normal, and Mike stood there in awe. The next thing he knew, he had a lapse of 
          consciousness and the craft was in a different place. It then disappeared in a flash. 
          Mike forgot about the entire incident until he had a series of terrifying dreams of 
          being taken inside a craft and examined by gray ETs. Recalling his sighting and missing 
          time, he realized he had been abducted by aliens.</p>

          <p>Following this encounter, weird things began to happen. He developed an interest and 
          advanced knowledge of electronics. He exhibited psychic abilities that were so powerful, he 
          vowed to never use them again. The encounter also changed his view of the world and his 
          place in it. Eventually, he would have another UFO sighting that convinced him he was 
          being watched by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p>Mike is just one of many people who are reporting UFO and extraterrestrial experiences.

          <h5>Jan 17, 2025 (1:32:07)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">For more than 100 years, people across the world have been 
          taken onboard extraterrestrial craft. Many of the cases have commonalities that corroborate 
          each other down to minute details. But they also have unique high strangeness aspects that 
          have much to teach us. This video presents ten spectacular onboard UFO cases involving 
          face-to-face interactions with a variety of ETs. Cases like these are the cutting edge of 
          UFO research and have the potential to answer the many questions surrounding alien contact.</p>

          <p><b>“I STARTED TO CRY.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MR GB</b>. 
          One <b>summer day of 1921</b>, an 8-year-old boy was playing along the Canal Nord in Peronne, 
          France when two tall, thin figures in metallic jumpsuits appeared, grabbed him, and took 
          him into a strange craft. Inside he was placed on a flexible couch in a small room. Mr. 
          GB cried and the ETs let him go, miles from where he had been taken.</p>

          <p><b>“THE SOUL LIVES FOREVER” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF EMILIA</b>. 
          One day in <b>July 1942</b>, Emilia was walking to her home in Niinisalo, Finland when a lady 
          appeared and spoke to her telepathically. The lady brought Emilia to a flying saucer 
          and invited her inside, showed Emilia how to fly the craft and spoke to her of spiritual 
          subjects. After being released, she fell ill and had to be hospitalized.</p>

          <p><b>“IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE IT, I CAN’T SAY I BLAME YOU.” THE ONBOARD 
          UFO ENCOUNTER OF RICARDO MACHADO</b>. Riding his motorbike near Pajas Blancas, 
          Argentina one <b>morning in April 1957</b>, Ricardo Machado saw a disc-shaped craft ahead of 
          him. He ditched his motorbike and hid. A man emerged from the craft, approached Ricardo, 
          and took him onboard. Unknown to Ricardo, many people in the area were seeing UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>“THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOVE US.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF 
          MR. GREENAMYER</b>. One <b>summer day in 1958</b>, three boys were playing outside their 
          homes in Novato, California when a strange silver craft appeared overhead. Two of the 
          boys fell asleep and one of the boys was shocked to see weird figures around them. The 
          witness had vague memories of attacking them. Later under hypnosis, he recalled being 
          taken onboard.</p>

          <p><b>THEY CAME FROM THE STARS. THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MRS. D.S.</b> 
          While driving to her home in Sedalia, Missouri at <b>11pm on August 16, 1965</b>, a young lady 
          was shocked to see a strange figure and a weird light in a field. She drove off in fear 
          and arrived home to find herself missing over an hour of time. Later under hypnosis, 
          she recalled being taken onboard a craft where she was examined by ETs.</p>

          <p><b>“I SAW THREE BEINGS.”  THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MRS. G</b>. 
          Hanging up her clothes in her backyard in Ermington, UK one <b>day in October 1965</b>, a woman 
          saw a glowing blue light hover overhead. Suddenly three figures in jumpsuits appeared, 
          grabbed her, and used a beam of light to lift her into the craft. She found herself in a 
          small room, but quickly passed out. She woke up in her backyard as the craft zipped away.</p>

          <p><b>TAKEN TO ANOTHER PLANET. THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DIRCEU GOES</b>. 
          One <b>night in June 1967</b>, Dirceu Goes saw a glowing sphere in the sky near his home in 
          Sarandi, Brazil. A beam of light came from the craft, carrying two short humanoids who 
          grabbed Dirceu and pulled him onboard. He found himself in a tiny low-ceilinged room and 
          remained there for 6 hours as the beings took him to what appeared to another world, then 
          took him back to Earth.</p>

          <p><b>THEY LOOKED LIKE INSECTS. THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF WENDEL AND 
          NANCY</b>. While driving <b>one night in June 1969</b> near Salt Lake City, Utah, a couple 
          was chased by a UFO. They pulled off at a rest-stop and saw a weird humanoid approaching. 
          Later under hypnosis, both recalled being taken onboard, put in a weird chair, and examined 
          by short ETs with blue eyes.</p>

          <p><b>“THE FEELING I HAD WAS ONE OF UNDERSTANDING.” THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF LUKE</b>. 
          While driving near Hillsboro, Kansas <b>one night in November 1971</b>, “Luke” was amazed to 
          see a silver flying saucer hover over a nearby field. He stopped his car and approached. 
          Two short, bald, human-looking ETs wearing robes invited him onboard and gave him a tour 
          of the craft. Afterward Luke began having psychic experiences.</p>

          <p><b>AN INSECTOID PRAYING MANTIS. THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF JUNE</b>. Driving to her 
          home in West Palm Beach, Florida on the <b>night of August 15, 1997</b>, a woman was puzzled 
          by a strange darkness descending over her car. She arrived home 30 minutes late. After 
          having other weird encounters, she used hypnosis and recalled that she had been taken 
          onboard a craft and examined by praying mantis type ETs.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, each adding to the growing database of similar accounts. One case like this 
          could be easily dismissed, or ten or even a hundred. But there are thousands of cases like 
          these, and some researchers believe it might number in the millions. As hard as they are 
          to believe, there are too many cases to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, 
          misperceptions, or mental illness. Humanity is in contact with aliens!</p>

          <h5>Jan 10, 2025 (1:15:33)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The cutting edge of the UFO phenomenon are cases involving 
          direct, firsthand, face-to-face contact with extraterrestrial humanoids. Unlike simple 
          sightings, humanoid encounters allow us to closely interact with the UFO occupants 
          themselves. Here are ten cases of extreme contact, cases of contact that are so close, 
          so extensive, they cannot be denied or explained away. These are the kinds of cases that 
          answer the many questions surrounding ET contact, such as who they are, where they come 
          from and why they are here.</p>

          <p><b>THE DISAPPOINTED ALIEN</b>. On the <b>night of October 18, 1954</b>, Renzo Pugina returned 
          home after a night at the movies. Walking up to his home in Parravicino, Italy, he was 
          confronted by a four-foot-tall, olive-skinned entity wearing a jumpsuit and helmet. Afraid 
          but curious, he approached the creature who struck him with a paralyzing beam of light. With 
          great effort, Renzo broke free of the paralysis and chased the figure away.</p>

          <p><b>THE MARTIAN STONE</b>. Around <b>midnight on November 17, 1954</b>, Alberto Sanmartin Comes 
          (a nurse) was taking a walk in Madrid, Spain, when he came upon a fair-skinned, angelic-
          looking man wearing a strange jumpsuit. The man walked up to a small craft landed nearby, 
          quickly returned, and gaveAlberto a small stone covered with odd symbols. He then returned 
          to his craft, which flew away. Alberto’s case generated national headlines as scientists 
          analyzed the alien artifact.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN FROGMEN</b>. One <b>night in 1956</b>, just after midnight, 13-year-old, Mr. E. 
          Venebles woke up in his bedroom in Aveley, UK, as a brilliant light flooded his backyard. 
          Looking out the window he saw a huge craft covered with colored lights. Through the portholes 
          he saw several strange figures wearing “frogmen’s suits.” Then he saw a shadowy figure standing 
          near his home. As he opened his window, the figure disappeared and the UFO flew off.</p>

          <p><b>“I SAW A MAN.”</b> On the <b>morning of April 23, 1966</b>, six-year-old Kim Baker 
          was picking flowers outside her home in Bingham, Maine when a classic flying-saucer 
          landed nearby. Kim was amazed to see a human-looking man smiling at her from one of the 
          portholes. After a few moments, the craft took off. Kim rushed home and told her mother, 
          who returned to the spot to find strange landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>“A HUMAN-LIKE BEING WAS WATCHING ME.”</b> On the <b>night of March 25, 1972</b>, 
          Mr. B. of Soesterberg, the Netherlands was woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, 
          he saw a strange light by his car. He rushed outside and felt compelled to drive off into 
          the night. Shortly later, he came upon a landed UFO and inside it, a human-like figure 
          looking at him.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS IN IOWA</b>. On <b>June 6, 1972</b>, Mr. Teig was working the cornfields of his farm 
          in Dayton, Iowa when a silver egg-shaped craft landed nearby. Out stepped three short alien 
          figures wearing metallic jumpsuits. Mr. Teig froze in amazement as the ETs explored his 
          crops for the next 30 minutes then returned to their craft and departed. At that time, many 
          farmers were finding strange burned circles in their fields.</p>

          <p><b>A SENSATION OF BEING WATCHED</b>. One <b>night in April 1973</b>, a man was driving near 
          Grelsby, Finland when he came upon a huge flying saucer. He exited his car to take a closer 
          look. He smelled a powerful order, and watched the craft move towards him. He could now see 
          strange figures in the portholes. The craft moved away. Later, the area would later having 
          many dramatic encounters.</p>

          <p><b>“THIS DEEP SILENCE SURROUNDED US.”</b> On the <b>night of August 22, 1975</b>, two 
          young men drove their motorcycles near St Omer, France. Suddenly a bright light zoomed up 
          behind them. They thought it was a car, but it disappeared, and moments later, they saw 
          a landed UFO and humanoids next to the highway. An eerie silence fell reigned as the two 
          humanoids rushed towards them. The men fled in a panic.</p>

          <p><b>SHOCKED BY A UFO</b>. On the <b>night of October 12, 1977</b>, Manoel Espirito 
          Santo and four friends were outside his home in Santo Antonio do Taua, Brazil when a 
          glowing light appeared, zoomed down and revealed itself to be a craft. Two figures 
          stood inside looking down on the group. A beam of light flashed down and struck 
          Manoel, immobilizing him. It then darted off. At the time, many people in the area 
          were having similar encounters.</p>

          <p><b>“WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU.”</b> In <b>1979</b>, as a young child in Lima, Peru, Renato 
          Longato woke up one evening to find a beautiful woman wearing a metallic jumpsuit approach 
          his bedside and instruct him to learn how to “use his mind.” Renato decided to develop his 
          psychic abilities, and years later, in 1985, had a face-to-face encounter with a handsome 
          ET approached him with a special message just for him.</p>

          <p>These ten firsthand cases of ET contact are just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of 
          cases like these are on record, reaching back decades and coming from across the world. 
          There are too many cases to deny, too much evidence. The truth is evident: we are being 
          visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <h5>Jan 3, 2025 (1:23:37)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Now introducing UFOs In Your Hometown: Episode Seven. This 
          ongoing series began with a challenge: name any town or city, and I bet I can find 
          a UFO case there. The response has been tremendous. More than 700 locations were 
          received. And so far, I have found UFO cases in every town and city I have investigated. 
          Sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences – all are represented. And 
          supporting them is a wide variety of evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, photos 
          and videos, landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances 
          and more. Today we explore seven new locations, supplied by you, the viewers. These 
          locations include Folsom, California; Napier, New Zealand; Bountiful, Utah; Hickory, 
          North Carolina; Evansville, Indiana and Kalispell, Montana. Have UFOs been seen in 
          your hometown? The answer is almost certainly, yes!</p>

          <p><b>FOLSOM, CALIFORNIA</b>. On <b>August 17, 1960</b>, witnesses observed a UFO hover 
          over the city for two hours. Throughout <b>1972</b>, numerous witnesses observed UFO activity 
          over Folsom Lake. This location would regularly produce more encounters over the years, 
          including all the way up to <b>2016</b>. A very dramatic sighting of a rare “daylight disc” 
          occurred along Highway 50 when two women were buzzed in their car by a low flying craft.</p>

          <p><b>NAPIER, NEW ZEALAND</b>. An early Napier sighting occurred in <b>1952</b> when a 
          trucker observed a fleet of six objects traveling in a row across the sky. In <b>1953</b>, 
          a group of boy-scouts described their encounter with a very strangely-shaped UFO. In 
          <b>1955</b>, more than 20 people driving through Napier pulled off the road to observe 
          a brilliant green UFO. Two years later in <b>1957</b>, multiple independent witnesses 
          saw a UFO on the same day. Activity continued in <b>1961, 1967</b> and in <b>1968</b>, 
          when a low flying UFO resulted in a witness being taken to court for reckless driving. 
          A sighting of a landed UFO in <b>1969</b> caught the attention of researchers as it 
          involved strange landing traces. Major sightings continued, making it clear that Napier 
          is of great interest to UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>BOUNTIFUL, UTAH</b>. Although this city is fairly large, it has produced only a few 
          significant UFO cases. One occurred in <b>1969</b> when two young men observed two UFOs while 
          attending a late-night movie at a drive-in theater. A sighting on <b>October 10, 2019</b> of 
          multiple objects received considerable attention from researchers as the witness was able 
          to obtain videotape of strange lights over the city.</p>

          <p><b>HICKORY, NORTH CAROLINA</b>. In <b>1952</b>, two independent witnesses both observed a 
          classic saucer move at high speed over the city. In <b>1959</b>, a witness reported being chased 
          by a glowing blue object in his car outside of Hickory, while numerous people in town and 
          outside of it called police to report UFOs. In <b>1978</b>, five young ladies reported a UFO 
          circling over the local college. More cases of UFOs chasing cars down Hickory Highways 
          occurred in <b>1980</b> and <b>1983</b>.</p>

          <p><b>MCKINNEY, TEXAS</b>. In <b>1956</b>, more than a hundred people, including the 
          mayor of the city, reported a UFO which hovered over McKinney for six hours. In 
          <b>2008</b>, an entire family was driving to a soccer match and all observed a strange 
          cigar-shaped craft. In <b>2018</b>, a couple reported the landing of a UFO in the field 
          behind their home. It turned out that they had prior sightings and perhaps deeper levels 
          of contact.</p>

          <p><b>EVANSVILLE, INDIANA</b>. In <b>1953</b>, a young boy saw a spherical-shaped craft 
          with humanoids looking down at him through portholes. Police were called who reportedly 
          opened fire on the object. One <b>night in 1955</b>, a group of students observed strange 
          green-skinned humanoids run across the playing field of a local high school. Major 
          sightings occurred in <b>1957, 1959</b> and in <b>1963</b> when three people were in 
          their car when it was disabled by a low-flying craft. Sightings continued in <b>1968, 
          1970, 1973</b> and in <b>1974</b> when a famous news-anchor reported his sighting of a 
          craft, and four people say they were abducted by a UFO. More sightings occurred regularly, 
          in <b>1975, 1976, 1978</b> and onward, including a <b>2008</b> sighting of a craft that 
          was so close, the witnesses called it the scariest moment of their lives.</p>

          <p><b>KALISPELL, MONTANA</b>. In <b>1956</b>, a UFO hovered over the nearby mountains for 
          so long that the Air Force scrambled six Starfire fighter jets to investigate. Through 
          the <b>1970s</b>, numerous people reported a wide variety of sightings over Kalispell, 
          some who were so impressed by their sightings, they reported them to UFO centers. Evan 
          as late as <b>2019</b>, UFOs were being seen over Kalispell.</p>

          <p>The cases speak for themselves. UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen everywhere on 
          this planet. Name any location, and you can be sure that UFOs have been seen there. UFO 
          encounters are far more common than most people think. In fact, the huge number of cases 
          coming from all over the world show that the ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity 
          campaign to announce their presence. They want us to know that we are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, 
          landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids and more. But the most extensive of all 
          UFO encounters is an onboard experience, being taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft. 
          Thousands of people accross the world have reported this experience. Cases reach back 
          more than 100 years. They involve a wide variety of humanoids and have both striking 
          similarities and unique differences. Here are seven firsthand accounts of people who 
          claim to have been taken onboard an ET craft.</p>

          <p><b>“PEACE BE WITH YOU”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF JL BUICK</b>. One day in <b>July 1913</b>, 
          prospector J.L. Buick and a friend were explored the Badlands region of Montana when a “small 
          brown man” approached and uttered the words, “Peace be with you, my friends.” Nearby sat a 
          100-foot-wide disc-shaped craft, surrounded by other small men. The man said that they had 
          monitored Earth for more than a hundred years. After a short conversation, the ETs boarded 
          the craft and departed. The craft returned the next day. J.L. Buick and his companion were 
          invited onboard and given a tour of the craft. The ETs said they powered it with an 
          “electromagnetic drive.” Afterwards, the men were returned to Earth.</p>

          <p><b>“GOD IS ONLY ONE”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MARIO RESTIER</b>. On <b>December 4, 
          1949</b>, Mario Restier was driving near Volta Redonda in Brazil when a 50-foot-wide 
          craft landed nearby. A telepathic voice said, “Don’t be afraid. Do you want to know what 
          it is?” Mario approached and met two humanoids who invited him onboard and, he says, 
          took him to their planet in the Orion system and given a tour of their city. He held a 
          long conversation with them and was returned to Earth. A second encounter occurred a few 
          years later. Mario began to study physics and soon began plans to build a magnetic motor.</p>

          <p><b>A STRANGE OCCURRENCE: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF COMMANDER HORATIO R. PENROSE</b>. 
          On <b>May 13, 1954</b>, Commander Horatio Penrose was driving near Derby, England when a 
          brilliant light swooped over his car. The next thing he knew, he was waking up in a 
          hospital recovering from head injuries. As time passed, he recalled that immediately 
          after the accident he was pulled onboard a craft by human-looking ETs who were interested 
          in his work with radar in the Navy. Later, Commander Penrose located a witness who had 
          seen the UFO hovering over his car.</p>

          <p><b>“THESE WERE NOT EARTH PEOPLE”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS OF MIMI GORZELLE</b>. On 
          the <b>afternoon of May 30, 1965</b>, Mimi Gorzelle lay on the roof of her cottage at 
          Mason Lake, Wisconsin when a UFO appeared. To her shock, she saw two gray ETs looking at 
          her from the portholes. The next thing she knew, the craft was leaving and four hours 
          had passed. Afterwards, she meditated on the incident and recalled that she was taken 
          onboard by the grays. A few months later, she was taken onboard again and saw human-
          looking figures who showed interest in her psychic abilities.</p>
 
          <p><b>“I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHAT A UFO WAS.”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF CARLOS ALBERTO 
          DIAZ</b>. Around <b>3:50 am on January 5, 1975</b>, Carlos Alberto Diaz was walking 
          with two friends to his home in Puerto Ingeniero White, Argentina when a UFO appeared 
          overhead. Carlos was was pulled onboard in full view of his two friends. Inside, he met 
          three greenish humanoids wearing tan, rubbery suits who began to take hair samples. 
          Carlos passed out and woke up hours later, and more than 400 miles away. Rushed to the 
          hospital, he was examined by 47 officials who became convinced of his encounter.</p>
          
          <p><b>TAKEN FROM THE BACK YARD: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF VLADIMIR KHARITONOV</b>. On 
          <b>January 15, 1978</b>, student Vladimir Kharitonov went to visit his parents in Pskov, 
          Russia. Going outside, he was shocked to see three humanoid figures dressed in metallic 
          suits in the backyard. Next to them was a small craft with a transparent dome. Vladimir 
          accepted an invitation to enter the craft, and suddenly realized that the craft was 
          flying upwards. Fearing he was being taken away, he became hostile and fought the ETs. 
          He promptly passed out and woke up lying in his parents’ backyard.</p>
          
          <p><b>PSYCHOANALYZED BY THE GRAYS: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF BRIAN X</b>. On 
          <b>February 24, 2011</b>, Brian (pseudonym) was in his home in Lee's Summit, Missouri 
          when colored lights entered his bedroom, putting him into a trance. He felt a small hand 
          grab his. The next thing he knew, he was lying on a table being examined by three gray 
          ETs. To his amazement, he had the impression that the craft itself was a living being, 
          and that it was psychically connected to the grays. He sensed that the grays were there 
          to help him. After being examined, he was returned to his bedroom.</p>
          
          <p>Seven encounters, each providing a tantalizing glimpse into the what it’s like to be 
          taken onboard a UFO. Each case provides another piece of the puzzle and adds to our 
          knowledge of ET contact. There are too many cases to explain away. UFOs are real; we are 
          being visited.</p>

          ENTITIES: TEN TRUE<br>
          EXTRATERRESTRIAL<br>
          ENCOUNTERS</a></h2>

          <h5>Dec 20, 2024 (1:07:44)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Many questions remain regarding the nature and origin of UFO 
          entities, which is why continuing research and documentation is so important. In this 
          video I present ten little-known cases from across the world, from the <b>1940s</b> to 
          the <b>2010s</b>. Many different types of humanoids are represented, gray ETs, short 
          little beings, human-looking ETs, very tall figures and more. Many involve multiple 
          witnesses and various forms of evidence. These ten cases provide a tantalizing glimpse 
          into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon: face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDING DURING WWII</b>. One <b>summer day in 1942</b>, thirteen-year-old 
          Madeleine Arnoux was bicycling near Verger, France. Stopping to pick some berries, she 
          was shocked to see a saucer-shaped craft and several dark-suited humanoids. Frozen in 
          fear, she bent down to get her bike. There was a blast of wind and the craft was gone. 
          But the memory remained for the rest of her life.</p>

          <p><b>“THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM US.”</b> On the <b>night of October 25, 1954</b>, two 
          12-year-old boys were minding sheep in the fields near Appignano, Italy when they came 
          upon three tiny beings wearing shiny suits, standing next to a strange craft. The beings 
          promptly fled into the craft which took off. The boys' encounter earned national news, 
          especially when another witness was found.</p>

          <p><b>“THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS.”</b> On the <b>night of August 10, 1962</b>, “J” awoke to
          find his bedroom filled with light. Looking into the backyard of his home in Vienna, 
          Virginia, he saw a small flying saucer, and next to it were three skinny figures with 
          large bald heads, huge dark eyes, and gray skin. They were holding hands, and J had the 
          strong impression they were his friends.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD</b>. At <b>9:30 pm on July 19, 1967</b> Maria de 
          Figueiredo picked corn from her father’s field in Sao Benedito do Sul, Brazil. Hearing 
          a weird sound, she turned around and saw a three-foot-tall being staring at her. Behind 
          him was a small craft with another being inside it. The being held up an ear of corn and 
          gestured at her. As the being returned to the craft, Maria became terrified and promptly 
          fainted.</p>

          <p><b>“THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!”</b> One <b>evening in June of 1973</b>, Louise 
          Gaudet woke up in her home in Alma, Quebec, Canada hearing an engine noise and watching 
          a green mist come into her room. Through the mist, she saw a small humanoid form wearing 
          a silver suit and a helmet. It appeared twice, and in the days that followed, Louise 
          began to have very unusual alien dreams.</p>

          <p><b>“I FELT TRANSFIXED WITH FEAR.”</b> As Phil Shepherdson drove his scooter to work 
          one <b>morning in February 1979</b> in Easingwold, UK, he was amazed to see a small craft 
          landed alongside the road. Stopping to look at it, he saw two very thin humanoid figures 
          standing next to it, and one inside it. All three stopped and looked at him. Suddenly he 
          felt a strong telepathic connection with the beings. Phil was overcome with fear, and 
          fled. Arriving at work, he discovered he was late, and may have had missing time.</p>

          <p><b>ET SURVEILLANCE</b>. On <b>September 25, 1983</b>, a young couple was camping 
          out near Playa de Salgueiros, Portugal, when they were woken up by a strange noise. 
          Looking outside, they saw three craft and four humanoid figures. The humanoids began 
          to walk around, surveying the field. For the next few hours, the craft remained flying 
          back and forth as if looking for something, before finally leaving.</p>

          <p><b>A HUMANOID BEHIND EACH WINDOW</b>. On <b>December 31, 1997</b>, eight children 
          decided to camp behind their homes in rural Kenwick, Western Australia. As one of them 
          noticed strange streaks of red light in the distant sky, he called it to the attention 
          of his friends. Suddenly a large craft zoomed towards them. And through the windows, 
          they saw humanoids looking down at them.</p>

          <p><b>THE PURPLE LIGHT BEING</b>. On the <b>night of December 21, 2004</b>, a man and 
          his nephew noticed a glowing object outside their home in Chillicothe, Ohio. Going to 
          investigate, they were amazed when humanoid forms emerged from it, and one flew down 
          and approached them. It was a glowing purple light being. The witness reached out and 
          shook its hand. It then floated back and departed. Unknown to him, numerous people in 
          the area were having encounters.</p>

          <p><b>THE GIANT ALIEN</b>. On the <b>night of August 21, 2014</b>, three friends decided 
          to meditate in a field near their homes in Talavera de la Reina, Spain. Suddenly a 
          glowing object appeared over their heads. Moments later, they were confronted by a 
          giant figure at least 12 feet tall. When it started to chase them, all three men fled 
          in fear. The next day, one of them found strange landing traces.</p>

          <p>These ten cases show how truly strange and bizarre contact with UFO entities can be. 
          So many different kinds of craft. So many varieties of humanoids. One thing that remains 
          very consistent is that the experience always affects the witnesses profoundly, proving 
          to them firsthand that we are not alone in this infinite universe.</p>

          OF KELLI ANDERSON</a></h2>

          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Dec 13, 2024 (1:07:33)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This video presents the high strangeness ET contacts of Kelli 
          Anderson (pseudonym) from southern California. Her story involves a wide variety of 
          paranormal entities and events, including ghosts, extraterrestrials, UFOs and missing 
          time, psychic and paranormal events, OBEs, nature spirits, precognition, orb visitations, 
          weird owl stories, an apparent miracle and more.</p>

          <p>Kelli Anderson was only eight years old when she experienced her first visitation by 
          strange entities. She was living with her father, mother, and older sister in a rural 
          home in Escondido. She was excited because she had just gotten her own room. One evening 
          in <b>1968</b>, she had just gone to bed and closed her eyes when a low rumbling sound 
          filled the room followed by the sense of a presence, and a glowing red light illuminating 
          the interior of her bedroom. Kelly was too afraid to open her eyes and lay there in 
          terror until the presence departed. It was to be the first of many strange events. She 
          found out that both her mother and grandmother had also reported a wide variety of 
          paranormal activity. She herself became drawn towards spirituality.</p>

          <p>At age eleven, a traumatic event altered the course of her life. Her parents moved 
          to the town of Julian, and Kelli found herself in an isolated rural area surrounded by 
          huge forests and mountains. It was the ideal place to heal from the recent terrible 
          events she had endured. She developed a great love for nature, and especially trees. 
          This led to a series of very unusual lucid dream encounters with a nature spirit. At 
          the same time, she and her family experienced ghostly activity in their new home, and 
          Kelli had more visitations by strange entities. She didn’t know who or what they were, 
          but they did not appear to be human.</p>

          <p>Then, at age twelve, Kelli had a dramatic UFO encounter that resulted in missing 
          time. It was an encounter that would become buried in amnesia for many years. Not long 
          after this, a disappointing Christmas morning led to one of the most miraculous events 
          of her entire life, an encounter so strange, wonderful, and mysterious that to this 
          very day she struggles to understand it. She continued to have more powerful 
          premonitions and realized that she was exhibiting a strong psychic ability.</p>

          <p>Then she met a Native American boy who lived on the nearby Santa Ysabel Indian 
          Reservation. Spending lots of time there, she experienced more profoundly unusual and 
          inexplicable events. Then, when her boyfriend joined the Army, they decided to get 
          married so they could remain together. Kelli traveled with him to Germany, where she 
          became pregnant. It was then that she was visited by strange troll-like entities who 
          came into her bedroom and seemed to be interested in her unborn baby. She gave birth 
          to a healthy baby boy, but as he grew up, he also began to complain of entities coming 
          into his room too.</p>

          <p>Time passed, and Kelli and her husband ending up getting a divorce. It was a 
          difficult time in her life. That’s when Kelli had an experience with magical glowing 
          orbs entering into her bedroom and bringing a sense of joy and love that healed her 
          of her depression. But strange events continued, including a lifelong series of weird 
          owl encounters. But soon, one incredibly profound and unusual owl experience would 
          occur which left her and her children utterly amazed.</p>

          <p>Driven to do more research to understand her encounters, Kelli learned that the 
          Native Americans have some profoundly interesting theories regarding the nature of 
          “little people” and aliens, and that many of them have encountered a wide variety 
          of unusual entities. She soon realized that she was very likely an ET contactee, 
          though she leaves her interpretations open as to what exactly this means. She also 
          received a another visitation by the nature spirit from her childhood, who answered 
          some of the many questions she had surrounding that very strange series of encounters.</p>

          <p>Strange events continued, including her home filling with eerie blue and green light 
          on multiple occasions, one of which was witnessed by a visiting friend. Kelli now 
          accepts the fact that her life has always been filled with mysterious and supernatural 
          events, and that such things a normal part of her life.</p>

          THE AMERICAN SITCOM</a></h2>

          <h5>Dec 6, 2024 (1:17:03)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs appear in virtually all forms of media. Advertising, 
          video-games, feature films, literature, radio, podcasts, social media platforms on 
          the internet, and especially television. Countless documentaries, dramas, and reality 
          TV shows have explored every facet of this subject. One form of television program that 
          has prominently featured UFOs is the situation comedy.</p>

          <p>Situation comedies first appeared on television in <b>1947</b>, coinciding almost 
          exactly with the dawn of the Modern Age of UFOs. Sitcoms are well-known for being 
          accurate yardsticks measuring the current state of American culture. Sitcoms have the 
          unique domain to express current values and morals. Whether it’s the wholesome family 
          image of The Brady Bunch, or the satirical sarcasm of Married with Children, sitcoms 
          broadcast a powerful message. They tell us what to wear, how to behave and what to 
          believe in.</p>

          <p>Sitcoms have tackled many controversial issues such as sexuality, crime, corruption, 
          religion, economics, mental health, politics, racism, drugs, mortality, and more. And 
          of course, one highly controversial subject covered by many sitcoms is the UFO 
          phenomenon. Nearly every aspect of the UFO phenomenon has come under intense scrutiny 
          and study. One avenue, however, that’s remained largely unexplored is how UFOs have 
          been portrayed on situation comedies.</p>

          <p>This video explores two dozen high-profile sitcoms that have had the courage to 
          present this controversial subject, and then we will see what the treatment of this 
          subject has to say about America’s attitude toward the UFO phenomenon. The sitcoms are 
          presented chronologically in order of appearance, and reflect how Americans’ perception 
          and understanding of UFOs changes over the decades.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It’s one of the most shocking and surprising experiences a 
          person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid. It almost 
          always has a profound impact on a witness, forever changing the way they think about 
          the Universe. This video presents ten shocking alien encounters from across the planet, 
          each providing important insights into the nature of extraterrestrial contact.</p>

          <p><b>THE MAN IN THE SPHERE</b>. In <b>1930</b>, Yakov Tabunshikov was only thirteen when 
          he stepped outside his home near Simferopol, Ukraine and witnessed an amazing sight: coming 
          up behind the roof of his neighbor’s house was a transparent sphere, and inside it was a man 
          in a white jumpsuit. Yakov watched in awe as the man in the sphere floated around the 
          neighborhood and finally moved away.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE BLUE MAN OF STUDHAM COMMON</b>. On <b>January 28, 1967</b>, a group of 
          young boys were playing outside their school in Studham Common, Bedfordshire, UK. Suddenly 
          a little blue man in a glowing jumpsuit appeared. The boys ran towards him and he vanished 
          in a puff of smoke. He soon reappeared and vanished again three more times, leaving behind 
          an enduring mystery.</p>

          <p><b>THE INDIFFERENT EXTRATERRESTRIALS</b>. Around <b>sunset on August 28, 1968</b>, 
          Juan Gascon del Toro was bicycling through a rural area of Aldaia, Spain when he came 
          upon a landed UFO. Several humanoid figures in divers’ suits stood by it. Juan stopped 
          his bike and stared in shock. Weirdly, the humanoids stared back at him and seemed not 
          to care that they were being observed. Overcome with fear, Juan fled the scene.</p>

          <p><b>THE VERY TALL ALIENS</b>. On the <b>evening of January 19, 1979</b>, Andrea X 
          was driving near Bastia, Italy when his car stalled. Getting outside to check the 
          engine, he noticed two odd-looking figures standing nearby. He paid them no attention 
          until the next day when he was driving in the same area and again his car stalled. 
          The same two figures were there. Looking at them, he saw they were not human. His car 
          would not start until the figures departed.</p>

          <p><b>I NEARLY RAN OVER AN ALIEN</b>. One <b>evening in the Spring of 1980</b>, a 
          family of four was driving to their home in Cassville, Missouri when they saw a 
          flying saucer landed in a field. As they watched it, suddenly a figure appeared in 
          front of the car. It was a gray alien. The father had to swerve the car to avoid 
          hitting it. This turned out to be one of a series of cases of landings and humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS IN FARMER’S FIELD</b>. On the <b>morning of September 4, 1987</b>, 
          farmers Armando and Rosa were in their beanfield in Balsamo, Brazil when a UFO 
          appeared overhead. Rosa ran in fear, but Armando stayed outside and saw the craft 
          come in for a landing. Then the craft tilted towards him and inside he saw two men 
          in jumpsuits staring back at him. They had dark eyes, dark hair and looked like 
          normal humans. Just then, his son arrived and the craft flew away.</p>

          <p><b>THE TINY FLOATING MAN</b>. One <b>night in August 1991</b>, El Vasco Landetcheverry 
          and his daughter were watching TV in their home in Las Pipinas, Argentina when two bright 
          lights appeared outside their home. Finally, El Vasco went outside to investigate. He 
          walked into a wall of fog, and out of it floated a tiny little man the size of a coke 
          bottle. It floated right up to him, stared at him, then floated back into the fog. The 
          strange lights disappeared.</p>

          <p><b>MEMORIES OF GRAYS</b>. In <b>2001</b>, “Alex,” (age 5) woke in the bedroom of his 
          home in Norfolk, Virginia to see the room filling with blue light. To his shock, several 
          small gray figures with bald heads and large dark eyes were in his room. This happened 
          several times, and later, as a young man, Alex found himself in telepathic contact with 
          one of the grays who imparted profound spiritual wisdom, changing his life forever.</p>

          <p><b>“STAY CALM…IT’S ALRIGHT.”</b> On the <b>night of February 15, 2015</b>, a woman 
          woke in the bedroom of her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She thought she 
          heard her boyfriend coming in, but instead it was an 8-foot-tall skinny being. The 
          witness was scared at first, but then felt a sense of tranquility and love coming from 
          the being. She was surprised by her own reaction of crawling back into bed as the 
          strange creature disappeared.</p>

          <p><b>THE TALE OF AN ALIEN WITH A TAIL</b>. One <b>sunny day in May 2016</b>, Arfon Jones 
          was driving along Tannyoky Road in County Armagh, Northern Ireland when he saw a strange 
          figure standing in the road in front of him. He drove up to it, stopped his car and stared 
          in amazement at a tall creature with a skinny muscular body, a bald head, large dark eyes, 
          and a long tail like a rat. To his relief, the creature ran off into the bushes. But Arfon 
          knew his life would never be the same.</p>

          <p>These ten cases show the dazzling variety of humanoids that our visiting our planet. 
          These experiences have been covered up for too long. But now, as the UFO subject goes 
          mainstream, the truth is coming out. All humanity faces the fact that we are not alone 
          in this universe.</p>

          TRULY STRANGE<br>
          UFO ENCOUNTERS</a></h2>

          <h5>Nov 22, 2024 (1:22:52)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO encounters are known for high strangeness. These eleven 
          close encounters of the second kind all involve cases which affected the environment or 
          the witnesses, in very unusual ways. These cases come from all over the world, and show 
          how truly bizarre a close encounter can be. It appears that high strangeness might be an 
          intentional feature which encourages witnesses to consider new paradigms and explore new 
          ways of thinking.</p>
          
          <p><b>MAY CAUSE UNCONTROLLABLE MOVEMENTS</b>. Little is known about this case, which 
          occurred on <b>November 10, 1957</b> to a man from Madison, Ohio. While watching a 
          low altitude UFO, he experienced uncontrollable movement of his hand, which would fly 
          up of its own accord to his face. Afterwards, he suffered from eye irritation.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE UFO ZONE OF SILENCE</b>. One day in the <b>Summer of 1965</b>, “Susan” and a 
          friend were playing badminton at RAF Chicksands, a satellite communications base in 
          Bedfordshire, UK, when both girls realized they had become completely deaf. Looking up, 
          they saw a low-flying UFO. Others came outside to view it and experienced the total 
          silence. Seven other military bases were visited that day.</p>
          
          <p><b>KNOCKED DOWN BY A UFO</b>. On the <b>night of November 1, 1966</b>, Mrs. Tibbetts 
          was in her Newfield, New Hampshire home when her son Dale ran inside to report a UFO 
          hovering outside. Looking out the window, Mrs. Tibbetts saw a huge craft just above her 
          rooftop. Seconds later, it struck her with a beam of light, knocking her down and causing 
          persistent eye irritation.</p>
          
          <p><b>ROCK-DROPPING UFO</b>. On the <b>evening of December 13, 1973</b>, Patrick Thrush 
          (16) was driving to a friend’s home in Bradenton, Florida when he saw what he thought 
          was a plane crashing. Pulling over, he saw it was a silver craft sending down a beam of 
          light into the river. As he snapped two photos, it zoomed at him and dropped three small 
          stones, one of which hit his car.</p>
          
          <p><b>UFO MAKES WAVES</b>. On the <b>night of March 29, 1974</b>, a couple were on the 
          beach at Lome, in Togo, Africa when a strange craft zoomed in from the ocean. As it 
          hovered above the water, it created a depression on the surface and sent huge waves onto 
          the beach. Then the couple was struck by a hot beam of light from the UFO which paralyzed 
          them. Afterwards, the man experienced vertigo, deafness and fainting.</p>
          
          <p><b>UFO LANDS AT TOBACCO FARM</b>. On <b>July 6, 1975</b>, tobacco farmer Joe 
          Borda saw silver dome-shaped UFO sitting in the field of his farm in Mount Pleasant, 
          Ontario, Canada. Strangely, he ignored it and forgot about it. But two days later, 
          going to where it had landed, he found a large circle of crushed and burned plants, 
          and two weird oily deposits. Later, strange voices and other high strangeness events 
          would occur.</p>
          
          <p><b>TRANSFORMED BY A UFO</b>. On the <b>evening of October 1, 1977</b>, Martin 
          Rodriguez was playing with friends near their homes in Tordesillas, Spain when he 
          came upon a landed UFO. Stepping towards it, he was struck by a beam of light. Upon 
          awakening, he suffered from vomiting, dizziness, vision problems, and fainting. He 
          was diagnosed with hydrocephaly, and had many surgeries. He also experienced a 
          mysterious boost in his intelligence.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE UFO THAT OPENED THE WINDOW</b>. On <b>April 12, 1979</b>, at the tail-end of a 
          UFO wave, a family was driving to their home in Brockton, Massachusetts when a UFO 
          appeared overhead. Suddenly all the windows of their car started opening and closing. 
          The UFO followed them home, continuing its window shenanigans. As the father and son 
          exited the car, both were struck by a beam of light from the craft.</p>
          
          <p><b>“A UFO SAVED MY LIFE.”</b> As a little girl living on a farm in rural Canton, Ohio, 
          Julie Riggs had a close-up UFO sighting that left her with psychic gifts and a strong 
          connection to the ETs. Later in life, around <b>1980</b>, she was harassed and then 
          chased in her car by two strangers. As she sped to get away, a UFO appeared and led her 
          off the highway, just in time to avoid hitting an abandoned vehicle on the road.</p>
          
          <p><b>UFO BEAMS FOUR BOYS</b>. One <b>night in the early 1980s</b>, as four young boys 
          from rural White Horse, Yukon Territory, Canada went for a walk in the woods, they were 
          confronted by a large craft. It moved towards them, hovered overhead, and sent down a 
          beam of light directly in their group. The boys flung themselves to the ground and the 
          craft moved off. The main witness reports that the encounter changed his life forever.</p>

          <p><b>A MINIATURE UFO</b>. One <b>evening in October 2016</b>, a 73-year-old man was 
          walking through a golf course in Worthing, UK when he came upon a shiny silver cylinder 
          about the size of a soda can. He tried to pick it up, but was unable. As he nudged it 
          with his foot, it took off, throwing him back with a strange force. It zipped away, 
          leaving no trace behind.</p>

          <p>These high strangeness cases make it clear that there is still much we don’t understand 
          about UFOs and these mysterious visitors to our planet. They do make one thing very clear: 
          we are being visited by something not from this planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The challenge continues! Name any town or city, and the 
          chances are almost 100% that a UFO encounter has occurred there. In <b>early 2024</b>, 
          I put out this challenge. So far, there have been cases in every single location. 
          Episode six presents ten new locations, each with a history of encounters. These 
          locations include Benson, Arizona; Greensboro, North Carolina; Edwardsburg, Michigan; 
          Bedfordshire, UK; Chicoutimi, Canada; Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Asheville, North 
          Carolina; Skagway/Juneau, Alaska and Bradenton, Florida. Sightings, landings, 
          humanoids, and onboard experiences, many supported by evidence such as photos, 
          radar-returns, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic 
          disturbances, and more! The truth can no longer be denied: UFOs are real!</p>

          <p><b>BENSON, AZ</b>. In <b>1952</b>, flight commander Chick Logan and many others were 
          at Marana Airbase when a UFO appeared overhead. Chick took off in his plane to intercept 
          the object. Although it was too high to reach, he did verify that it was not a balloon. 
          Four years later in 1956, a fleet of a dozen objects move over Benson, alerting the 
          Ground Observers Corp. In 2022, a Benson resident captured an anomalous light on an 
          automatic camera outside his home.</p>

          <p><b>GREENSBORO, NC</b>. In <b>May 1930</b>, Joseph Rankin and his wife were shocked 
          when a UFO landed in the backyard. Even more shocking, they saw a humanoid inside. In 
          1946, two solders had a closeup observations of three disc-shaped objects. More 
          sightings occurred in <b>1952, 1955, 1963 and 1966</b>. That same year, teenager 
          David Oldham was taken onboard a craft and examined by gray-type ETs. The sightings 
          continued, including several photographic cases.</p>

          <p><b>EDWARDSBURG, MI</b>. This small town produced a few dramatic case, including 
          three events in <b>2008</b> alone, each involving solid objects moving in anomalous 
          ways. In one case, a gentleman described a triangular craft which swooped mere feet 
          above his car. In <b>2022</b>, a man saw what he thought was a shooting star, until 
          it made a right turn and zipped up and away.</p>

          <p><b>BEDFORDSHIRE, UK</b>. In <b>1956</b>, shopkeeper John Whitworth was visited by an 
          unusual-looking gentleman who gave him directions to a UFO sighting, beginning a strange 
          adventure that almost led to direct contact. One year later, pilot John Jordan had two 
          close-up sightings in a row. In 1962, two young sisters watched a UFO hover over their 
          backyard, and inside they saw two humanoids. Many other cases, including an entire 
          family who experienced missing time.</p>

          <p><b>CHICOUTIMI, QUEBEC, CANADA</b>. In <b>April 1968</b>, Mrs. Tremblay saw a UFO 
          outside her home, and minutes later, saw a short humanoid. In <b>1970</b>, Mrs. 
          Desneige described a UFO which hovered directly above her neighbor’s home. In 
          <b>2013</b>, another witness saw a strange cylindrical object moving overhead at 
          high speed.</p>

          <p><b>DALLAS-FORT WORTH, TX</b>. In <b>1947</b>, a woman saw a UFO with occupants who 
          stopped their craft to wave at her. In 1958, a young girl said a gray-type ET stared at 
          her from her bedroom window. In <b>1972</b>, a family in Dallas saw a 30-foot-wide UFO 
          being chased by jets. In 1974, Dallas-Fort Worth Airport experienced a wave of sightings. 
          More cases, including an onboard experience, an apparent dog-man, and possible ETs walking 
          among us!</p>

          <p><b>ASHEVILLE, NC</b>. In <b>1947</b>, a sighting over a park in Asheville kicked off 
          the modern age of UFOs. Dramatic sightings continued in <b>1957, 1974, 1977, 1987 and 
          1989</b>. These are not just anomalous lights, but solid craft seen by multiple 
          witnesses. In <b>2013</b>, Reverend Michael Carter was visited by a human-looking ET 
          who cured him of a severe blood-clot in his leg. So many cases!</p>

          <p><b>SKAGWAY/JUNEAU, AK</b>. Way back in <b>1916</b>, numerous people saw a UFO from 
          the decks of the Steamer, Georgia. In 1969, two other sailors found their boat, The Teel, 
          disabled by a low flying craft. A sighting in <b>1973</b> impressed several witnesses, 
          and in <b>1980</b> the small town of Kate experienced a dramatic UFO display. In <b>1996</b>, 
          a Skagway woman had a closeup brush with a UFO that resulted in missing time.</p>

          <p><b>BRADENTON, FL</b>. Several military personnel experienced dramatic close-up 
          encounters in <b>1949 and 1955</b>. Very unusual sightings were reported in <b>1957 
          and 1959</b>. In <b>1971</b>, a police officer reported a face-to-face encounter with a 
          humanoid asking about the wars on our planet. More cases in <b>2002, 2003 and 2006</b> 
          make is clear that Bradenton is of interest to the ETs.</p>

          <p>These ten locations, provide by you the viewers, show once again that UFOs are 
          ubiquitous, and that ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity campaign to announce 
          their presence. With so many cases and so much evidence, the time for skepticism 
          is over. The truth can no longer be hidden, distorted, ignored, or denied. UFOs are 
          real and we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          TEN TRUE CASES</a></h2>

          <h5>Nov 8, 2024 (1:06:20)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Thousands of people have had the experience, if not millions: 
          a face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials. Cases come from all over the world, and 
          they share profound commonalities and differences. It appears that the humanoid form is 
          the universal template. And yet, many cases have rare or unique elements of high 
          strangeness that defy comprehension. This article/video presents ten cases of this 
          kind. These cases have much to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and these strange 
          visitors to our planet.</p>

          <p><b>THEY CAME BACK</b>. One <b>night in September of 1951</b>, Louise McDougall, her 
          husband and three friends sat on the lawn of their homes in Bloomington, California. 
          Sensing somebody looking at her, Louise saw a disc-shaped craft with portholes hover 
          overhead. Through the portholes, she saw four human-looking men in jumpsuits looking 
          down at her. She grabbed her flashlight and shone it at the craft, causing it to dart 
          away. But 15 minutes later, it was back again!</p>

          <p><b>“WE RAN AS FAST AS WE COULD.”</b> One <b>summer day in 1958</b>, 11-year-old 
          Hilary Porter and her friend Janet were walking near their homes in Farnborough, UK 
          when a  silver craft appeared overhead. It promptly descended, a door opened, and a 
          tall humanoid figure appeared in the doorway. After a few moments of shock, the girls 
          fled. Soon, Hilary would learn that she was a UFO contactee.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOIDS IN GOSHEN</b>. On the <b>night of October 19, 1973</b>, Mrs. Wright 
          reported a UFO over her home in Goshen, Ohio. Researcher Charles Wilhelm arrived to 
          visit her, but instead interviewed her neighbor, “Sam,” who described coming upon a 
          landed UFO and humanoids. He wasn’t the only witness. Two weeks later and a short 
          distance away, Don Brandenburg came upon a landed UFO. Later that night, a Mrs. 
          Gilbert saw a strange humanoid in the exact same spot.</p>

          <p><b>THE GOFFSTOWN VISITATIONS</b>. On the <b>afternoon of November 4, 1973</b>, Rex 
          Snow of Goffstown, New Hampshire (and his neighbors) saw a flying saucer. That night, 
          an odd light filled his backyard. Looking outside, he saw two humanoids in silver 
          jumpsuits collecting samples from his yard. Three days earlier and 6 miles away, 
          Florence Dow was scared by the appearance of a faceless humanoid on her porch. Six 
          hours later, Lyndia Morel had a scary encounter with a UFO and humanoid in Goffstown. 
          Meanwhile, police stations across the state were flooded with UFO calls.</p>

          <p><b>THE MONK-LIKE ALIENS</b>. On the <b>night of November 13, 1973</b>, Ann Dolphijn 
          Vermeulen woke to see three strange humanoid figures outside the window of her home in 
          Uden, Netherlands. She watched them for five minutes as they walked down the street and 
          move away. Returning to her bedroom and looking out the window, she saw a large glowing 
          red sphere.</p>

          <p><b>THE GLOWING MEN</b>. At <b>6:30 on August 15, 1981</b>, more than twenty people 
          who worked at the La Rochelle estate in Zimbabwe were amazed by the appearance of a 
          glowing sphere and two to four glowing humanoid figures in white jumpsuits. Panic 
          reigned as several witnesses fled into the forests. Others stayed to see the sphere 
          move around the estate. Soon the figures left, leaving behind an enduring mystery.</p>

          <p><b>IT CAME FROM THE SKY</b>. One day in <b>spring 2003</b>, three cement truck 
          drivers arrived at their destination in Reinoso de Cerrato, Spain just in time to see 
          a bizarre-looking humanoid descend from the sky and stand on the ground 30 feet away. 
          The being was 5 feet tall, dressed in a jumpsuit, but its head appeared to be composed 
          only of a hollow transparent ring. After a few moments, the figure flew back upwards 
          and disappeared into the distance.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS BY THE MEGALITHS</b>. One day in <b>February 2008</b>, two women were 
          visiting Ile de Berder, France to see the many mysterious megalithic structures at this 
          location. Instead they saw a strange glowing sphere followed by the appearance of four 
          gray ETs. One of the witnesses was left with the impression that she was being warned 
          about the dangers of nuclear power.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN MY BEDROOM</b>. On the <b>night of November 9, 2013</b>, “Melissa,” 
          was in the bedroom of her home in Virginia Beach, VA when a strange feeling overcame 
          her. Looking up, she saw a tall gray-skinned humanoid appear in her room. She was unable 
          to move as it approached. She felt herself being drawn upwards and blacked out. The next 
          morning, her brother complained about the dogs barking furiously and a brilliant light 
          appearing outside the home.</p>

          <p><b>THE WITHLACOOCHEE ET</b>. On the <b>night of April 2, 2015</b>, “Philip” was 
          driving an 18-wheeler truck on State Road 41 in the Withlacoochee Forest in Florida 
          when he noticed a short, uniformed figure holding a strange device standing alongside 
          the road. As he passed by, he saw that it did not appear to be human. This turned out 
          to be one of several encounters occurring in this area.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, each providing more evidence of the extraterrestrial presence on our 
          planet. The truth can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. We are being 
          visited by ETs.</p>

          SHOCKING CASES</a></h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Nov 1, 2024 (0:56:46)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It has been called the ultimate UFO encounter, the closest 
          of all encounters: an onboard UFO experience. There are thousands of well-documented 
          cases, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. These cases of 
          direct contact with ETs involve extensive interactions and contain more information 
          about the extraterrestrials than any other kind of encounter. Here are six shocking 
          cases from across the world: Australia, Canada, France and three from the United States. 
          The UFO phenomenon is so much more than just simple sightings of unexplained lights in 
          the sky. It’s about meeting people from other worlds.</p>

          <p><b>“I WAS IN A UFO.”</b> In <b>1972</b>, “Steve” (age 24) was staying in a cabin in 
          the wilderness of Cariboo, British Columbia, Canada. One summer day, he stepped outside 
          and was amazed to see two silver discs fly at treetop level a few hundred feet away. 
          He somehow knew they were going to land and that he had to go meet them. He asked his 
          girlfriend to join him, but she strangely refused. Steve went alone and came upon the 
          two craft, landed on the ground. One had an open door and a ramp leading to the ground. 
          Curious, Steve approached and entered. Inside he saw two short humanoids with gray 
          wrinkled skin, wearing white doctors’ smocks. Afraid, he was about to run when one spoke 
          telepathically in perfect English, “It’s okay, come on in.” So began an extensive onboard 
          experience that Steve would keep secret for most of his life.</p>

          <p><b>TAKEN IN TARBORO</b>. James Howard (age 15) and his friend Brian Hollis (age 14) 
          had been seeing odd lights near their homes in Tarboro, NC for a few weeks. Then, on 
          the <b>night of November 12, 1976</b>, they saw a metallic, disc-shaped craft with 
          colored lights land in the forest nearby. Going to investigate, they became frightened 
          when a glowing, white-suited humanoid figure appeared. When they arrived home, more 
          than an hour had passed. James began having nightmares of being onboard. Later, under 
          hypnosis, he recalled that both he and Brian were floated up into the craft, separated 
          and given medical exams.</p>

          <p><b>YURANI</b>. It was a <b>warm night in July 1981</b> as “Robert” (age 16) played 
          frisbee with his dog outside his home in Seattle, Washington. Suddenly, clouds rolled 
          in and Robert saw colored lights overhead. He now found himself unable to move as a 
          warm beam of light pulled him up into the craft. He recalled seeing a being with cat-
          like eyes, then woke up the next morning in bed. Years later, he recalled a long onboard 
          experience where he was met by a hybrid human-gray who introduced herself as Yurani. She 
          told him that she was more than 200 years old, and began to impart a lot of information 
          about why the ETs were visiting Earth. At one point, Robert was taken to their home 
          planet.</p>

          <p><b>SEVEN HOURS ONBOARD AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT</b>. Eduardo Pons Prades was a famous 
          political author in Spain when, on the <b>night of August 31, 1981</b>, his life changed 
          forever. He was driving through the Pyrenees in France when he became weirdly lost and 
          his car mysteriously stalled. Walking down a narrow country road, he came upon a large 
          craft landed in a field. A door opened and a commanding voice spoke to him telepathically: 
          “Don’t be afraid. Please approach…Come up to our ship. We wish to speak with you.” Unable 
          to resist, Eduardo went onboard and was greeted by a group of beautiful human-looking 
          people in white jumpsuits. They told him that they had contacted him because of his 
          expertise in human violence, and that he needed to give the world a message.</p>

          <p><b>“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.”</b> One <b>night in March 1982</b>, an anonymous woman 
          driving near Springfield, Missouri noticed a strange light at treetop level ahead of 
          her car. At that moment, she seemed to lose control of the steering wheel and felt like 
          her car was floating. The next thing she knew, she was parked next to a huge craft 
          landed in field. She was drawn onboard and was greeted by six tall, strong, human-
          looking figures with blue eyes and blonde hair. They examined her and said that they 
          were researching human reproduction. They said that they were her friends and would 
          see her again.</p>

          <p><b>“WHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR?”</b> One <b>night in 1986</b>, three young men were 
          camping in the wilderness outside of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia when they heard 
          a strange noise overhead. Looking up, a brilliant light approached and descended, 
          revealing itself to be a silver disc-shaped craft. Two little beings appeared underneath 
          and approached the men, who found themselves now unable to move. All three men were 
          floated up into the craft and subjected to a strange examination involving lights. The 
          ETs were friendly and smiling as the witnesses were given a tour of the craft and soon 
          saw something which left them speechless with wonder.</p>

          <p>Six shocking onboard UFO encounters, each providing profound insights into the 
          nature and origins of extraterrestrials, each providing answers about the ET agenda 
          on our planet. We are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While there are still those who remain skeptical of UFOs 
          and extraterrestrials, there are many who not only believe, they KNOW. They have moved 
          beyond belief to actual experiential knowledge. A firsthand encounter with extraterrestrials 
          changes the way a person views the universe. They know beyond doubt that we are not alone 
          in this universe. And a lot of people have had this kind of experience. This video presents 
          ten firsthand accounts of people who have met humanoids face-to-face. These cases come from 
          all over the world. They show that we are not the only people in this universe. We are one 
          of many!</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS AND THE SHEPHERD BOY</b>. In the <b>Summer of 1938</b>, Mariano Melgar, 
          a seven-year-old shepherd boy from Munico, Spain was minding his family’s herd of cows 
          when an ET craft landed nearby. A door opened and three men stepped out. Mariano approached 
          to get a closer look and one of them shot him with a beam of light. Mariano thought they 
          might be from another country. Later he would change his mind.</p>

          <p><b>USO AND HUMANOID AT LAKE LANGELMAVESI</b>. When Ilona Johansson-Paasonen went to 
          enjoy a vacation in <b>August 1945</b> at Lake Langelmavesi, Finland, she was awakened 
          one morning by light blazing into her room. Looking outside, she saw a fiery object zoom 
          towards her. She dove to the ground in fear. Peering outside again, she saw two figures 
          in a boat that clearly was not normal. Weirdly, she passed out.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS AT THE WATER FOUNTAIN</b>. On the <b>night of December 24, 1950</b>, 
          ten-year-old Antonietta Chiara was sent outside her home in Cossoine, Italy to fetch a 
          pail of water. Going to the nearby fountain, she saw three thin humanoid figures with 
          oversized heads and big dark eyes, and all three were staring right at her. Realizing 
          they were not human, she panicked and fled.</p>

          <p><b>THE MEN IN THE TRANSPARENT SPHERE</b>. On the <b>night of October 18, 1968</b>, 
          three people were enjoying dinner in their home in Medulla, Florida when suddenly the TV 
          quit and the dog freaked out. Looking outside, they saw a transparent sphere floating 
          near their house. And inside it were two short men working a strange device. Little did 
          they know, people all over the area were seeing UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO REPAIR CASE</b>. One <b>night in February 1970</b>, Leona Nielsen and her 
          friend were staying in a cabin near Coram, Montana when a light outside caught their 
          attention, and they saw a classic flying saucer landed along the river shore. It seemed 
          to be in trouble and was shooting out colored sparks over a wide area, while two human-
          looking figures rushed around it. Leona had the impression that the craft was damaged.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS ON THE SIDEWALK</b>. It was <b>11pm on June 18, 1980</b> as Antonio D’Amico 
          walked along a sidewalk in the small village of Barrancas, Argentina. Suddenly he noticed 
          two short humanoids wearing skintight luminous jumpsuits standing a short distance away. 
          Both were staring at him. Fearful, Antonio decided to leave. But to his shock, the 
          strange figures followed.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN ROBOT ON THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND</b>. One <b>afternoon in mid-April 1990</b>, 
          five children were on the playground of the Yerevan Primary School #111 in Yerevan, 
          Armenia when a spherical object landed behind the school. Three robotic beings came out. 
          One approached the students and spoke to them about the future of their country, but not 
          before striking one with a beam of light and levitating another boy.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS AT SUMMER CAMP</b>. It was <b>1991, the last night at summer-camp</b> for a 
          group of girls in Pelrhimov, Czech Republic. As they sat around the bonfire, a brilliant 
          beam of light shone down on them. It was a UFO! The camp leaders ordered all the girls to 
          their tents. But shortly later, a few of them sneaked out and came face-to-face with three 
          tall humanoids in divers’ suits. The UFO remained overhead.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS BY THE CHAPEL</b>. On the <b>night of December 27, 2006</b>, a college 
          student was walking by the chapel at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, Africa when a 
          glowing egg-shaped craft dropped from the sky and landed in front of her. Moments later, 
          an ET emerged. The student was unable to move as two more figures appeared, then one of 
          them approached her. Thankfully, two other students came on the scene.</p>

          <p><b>THE HUNTERS BECOME THE HUNTED</b>. It was <b>3am on December 12, 2011</b>, as three 
          hunters and one of their sons were hiking back to their car after hunting in Kaimai Ranges 
          of New Zealand. When a glowing object appeared overhead, they became puzzled. When it 
          moved closer and revealed itself to be a craft, they became concerned. Shortly later, 
          they came face to face with a strange humanoid that would leave them all shaken.</p>

          <p>These ten cases provide just a brief glimpse into the nature of contact with UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials. The truth is that there are thousands upon thousands of cases, each 
          of them unique, each providing another piece of the puzzle that is the UFO mystery. The 
          only thing we know for sure is that UFOs are real, and we are not alone in this universe.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are ubiquitous! They are seen everywhere on our planet. 
          Every town, every city, everywhere! In Part Five of this ongoing you the viewers have 
          provided nine new locations to investigate and find UFO cases. And once again, research 
          shows that UFOs have left no place behind. Eugene, Oregon----Homewood, Illinois----
          Niagara Falls, New York & Ontario Canada----Glenwood, MN----Helena, MT----Tucson, 
          Arizona----Monterey, CA---Rotherham, UK: all of them have been visited by extraterrestrials. 
          That includes sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences, with many cases 
          supported by evidence including photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects, 
          electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more. We are not alone!</p>

          <p><b>EUGENE, OREGON</b> shows a long UFO history. In <b>1947</b>, a married couple had 
          a dramatic encounter with a low-level UFO. In <b>July of 1955</b>, the audience of a 
          drive-in movie theater in Eugene witnessed a dazzling UFO display. Cases in <b>1959, 
          1960, 1971 and 1976, 1982, 1986, 1986</b> most involving multiple witnesses, including 
          police. In <b>2015</b>, a Eugene woman saw gray aliens in her bedroom. In <b>2016</b> a 
          witness captured startling photos of a UFO.</p>

          <p><b>HOMEWOOD, ILLINOIS</b> is a suburb of Chicago with a few impressive accounts. On 
          <b>April 28, 1952</b>, two witnesses observed a silver-white dome-shaped object flying 
          circles around an airplane. They called the US Army Regional office who routed the case 
          to Blue Book. But the Air Force wasn’t interested! On <b>November 8, 1973</b>, three 
          sightings hit the Chicago area, including Homewood, and then moved over a shopping 
          center!</p>

          <p><b>NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK & ONTARIO, CANADA</b> have been visited many times. A very 
          early and impressive sighting occurred in <b>1833</b>. All throughout the <b>1950s</b> 
          numerous sightings occurred , many involving military witnesses. In <b>1955</b>, two 
          families picnicking near the falls saw a USO emerge from Lake Erie. They all saw humanoids 
          inside the craft. In <b>1958</b>, a woman saw a UFO landed by the highway, leaving landing 
          traces. In <b>1960</b>, a young man had a UFO talk to him, then follow him home and take 
          him onboard. In <b>1963</b>, airport tower personnel saw a UFO which Project Blue Book 
          said was just a balloon! More cases throughout the <b>1970s to the 2000s!</b></p>

          <p><b>GLENWOOD, MINNESOTA</b> was visited on <b>September 25, 1954</b> when dozens of 
          people over a wide area reported UFOs. In 2003, Cindy Lou Schmidt not only saw a UFO 
          from the porch of her Glenwood home, she managed to capture a photograph of it. MUFON 
          field investigators declared the case unknown.</p>

          <p><b>HELENA, MONTANA</b> had sighting way back in <b>1947</b> when a massive fleet of 
          12 objects flew over the city. In <b>1973</b>, cement truck driver John Struble was at 
          Flesher Pass when a UFO sent down a beam of light disabling his truck and scaring the 
          daylights out of him. In <b>1976</b>, numerous people across Helena called the police 
          to say that UFOs were zooming over the city.</p>

          <p><b>TUCSON, ARIZONA</b> is the location of hundreds of encounters. Here we look at 
          nearly a dozen cases involving humanoids and onboard encounters. In <b>1952</b>, a 
          woman hiking outside of Tucson saw a UFO, then a gray walk up to her and she then 
          found herself inside a craft. In <b>1960</b>, Charlie Green was pulled out of his home 
          by four grays. Unknown to him, someone outside his home watched him being taken. In 
          <b>1977</b>, a woman saw a UFO land next to the Veterans Hospital. A silver-suited 
          humanoid came out and pulled her onboard, holding a long conversation with her. In 
          <b>1981</b>, a woman saw a UFO outside her home, was taken onboard and saw three 
          different types of ETs. In <b>2001</b>, a teenage boy made a wish to see an alien, 
          and moments later saw a flying humanoid. In 2007, a woman sent a telepathic hello to a 
          UFO. That night, she found herself being visited by humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA</b> has several impressive encounters. In <b>April 10, 1950</b>, 
          numerous policemen saw had a daylight encounter with a shiny silver disc. Even a 
          prisoner saw it! In <b>1950</b>, a train engineer had a dramatic encounter as a UFO 
          paced his train. In <b>1967</b>, a UFO hovered 100 feet over a farmhouse. In <b>1973</b>, 
          a low-level UFO was viewed by police. That same year, Fort Hunter-Liggett Army base had 
          a very dramatic encounter and also possibly a UFO crash with bodies. In <b>1974</b>, 
          several residents of an apartment building all called the police to report a fast-moving 
          egg-shaped object. In <b>2017</b>, a “cloaked” cylindrical craft moved over the city.</p>

          <p><b>ROTHERHAM, UK</b> was the location of a spooky humanoid goat-man seen back in 
          <b>1937</b>. The years of <b>1977, 1981, 1987, 1988 and 1997</b> produced many 
          spectacular cases. More cases occur, even as late as 2001 when witnesses reported a 
          craft moving with a strange pendulum motion.</p>

          <p>The cases speak for themselves. All over the world UFOs are being seen. UFO activity 
          is far more common and widespread than previously thought. It appears that the ETs want 
          us to know they are here! The truth is obvious: UFOs are seen all over the planet, 
          including your own hometown.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While there are still many questions surrounding the origin 
          of UFOs and their occupants, the most popular theory is that they are from the stars, 
          in other words: extraterrestrial. This video presents twelve cases from across the world 
          involving a wide variety of ETs. These reports are supported by a wide variety of 
          evidence: photos, medical effects, landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic 
          disturbances and more. It’s time for this subject to be taken seriously by everyone on 
          this planet.</p>

          <p><b>THE HUMANOID IN THE FIREBALL</b>. One <b>evening in the Summer of 1961</b>, 
          “Mike” (age 7) was camping with his buddy in the backyard of his home in Anaheim, 
          California. Suddenly a fiery object swooped down and hovered overhead. Inside, he 
          saw a humanoid figure looking down at him.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN UNDER THE BRIDGE</b>. A <b>summer day in 1963</b>, a group of children 
          were playing in a park in Lesnica, Poland when a silver-suited short humanoid appeared 
          next to them. Time seemed to move in slow motion as the figure gestured at them to come 
          closer. The children fled, and refused to return to the park again.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE ETS IN THE TINY UFO</b>. On <b>November 15, 1969</b>, Madame X looked 
          out the window of her apartment in downtown Nancy, France and saw a tiny UFO glide 
          towards her window, stop and hover. Inside she saw two tiny little ETs smiling and 
          looking right at her. It zoomed away. Afterward, the witness discovered her face had 
          been slightly burned.</p>

          <p><b>VISITORS TO EARTH</b>. One <b>summer night in 1972</b>, a lady from Oslo, Norway 
          saw a large saucer-shaped craft with big picture windows hovering at treetop level. Even 
          more shocking, she saw humanoid figures bustling about inside. Oddly, although other 
          people were around, she seemed to be the only one to see it!</p>

          <p><b>A UFO PARKED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD</b>. <b>Late at night on September 6, 1973</b>, 
          two people drove along the Eyre Highway near Penong, South Australia. The passenger was 
          asleep when a telepathic voice woke her up. Looking outside, she saw a UFO parked 
          alongside the road. One humanoid stood next to it, and another was visible through a 
          window.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS ON THE BEACH</b>. One day in <b>June 1975</b>, a couple walked along 
          Playa de Marin Beach in Spain when three UFOs appeared, landed on the beach, and out 
          came three short humanoids dressed in jumpsuits. The three beings converged and then 
          returned to their craft. One of the witnesses tried to communicate telepathically, but 
          got a bad headache.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MAN IN THE SILVER SUIT</b>. One <b>night in October 1977</b>, Jose 
          Benedito Santos (age 78) was hunting near Chapada das Mesas, Brazil when a glowing 
          object landed near him. He approached and saw a short humanoid wearing a silver suit 
          and helmet. It walked right up to him, and Jose promptly fainted. When he awoke, he 
          found a weird mark on his neck.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS ON THE BALCONY</b>. When four people drove near Danville, California one 
          evening in <b>summer of 1979</b>, they were amazed to see a glowing object pace their 
          car. They stopped and watched as the object came lower, revealing itself to be a saucer-
          shaped craft. On a balcony surrounding the craft, they saw several very tall humanoid 
          figures. Later, they learned many people saw UFOs in that area on that night.</p>

          <p><b>CONVERSATION WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL</b>. On the <b>night of August 24, 1985</b>, 
          a couple (both doctors) drove along Route 12 near Ituzaingo, Argentina when a UFO blocked 
          the road. A beautiful man dressed in a jumpsuit walked up to their window and held a long 
          conversation with them. He told them he was from another planet, and that the people of 
          Earth needed to know that we are not alone.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN FROM THE BLACK SPHERE</b>. Throughout <b>1988-1989</b>, a farming couple 
          from San Piero a Sieve, Italy experienced repeated visits by a flying humanoid which 
          would arrive in black sphere. It warned them to keep away, but then damaged their crops. 
          After several visits, the husband rushed forward to stop the ET. It quickly struck him 
          with a beam of light. That was the final visit.</p>

          <p><b>A NIGHT IN THE TREE WITH ALIENS</b>. On <b>May 17, 1997</b>, three teenage boys 
          became lost in the wilderness of La Rumorosa, Mexico. Taking refuge in a tree for the 
          night, a saucer appeared overhead, followed shortly by several glowing short humanoids. 
          The humanoids soon discovered the boys and actually climbed the tree to observe them. 
          The witnesses' lives were profoundly changed forever.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET WHO WALKED ON WATER</b>. One day in <b>1999</b>, a man was hiking next to 
          a pond in a natural area near Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada when he saw a tall 
          humanoid figure in a white jumpsuit and helmet floating inches above the water. 
          Suddenly it noticed him and glided across the surface of the water, running off into 
          the forest.</p>

          <p>These 12 cases alone make it undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials, 
          but the truth is that there are thousands of more cases. It is no longer possible to 
          deny the truth of the ET presence on our planet. The evidence is clear: we are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Oct 4, 2024 (1:10:18)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Some UFO encounters are so incredibly weird, that after it 
          occurs people can hardly believe that it actually happened! This episode presents eight 
          cases from across the world of truly high strangeness, each involving close encounters 
          of the second kind, in which the environment is affected in some way. Many of these cases 
          have multiple witnesses, and virtually all of them involve some form of evidence: radar 
          confirmation, photographs, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, 
          electromagnetic disturbances. These are the kinds of cases that simply cannot be denied.</p>

          <p><b>UFO COLLIDES INTO A HOUSE</b>. On <b>April 23, 1966</b>, Jeanne Kalnicki and her 
          six kids were shocked to see a UFO hovering right outside their home in Dorchester, 
          Massachusetts. It fact, it was so close, they thought it might hit them. It moved off, 
          but just a few hours later, it was back, and this time it ran right into the side of 
          their apartment building, causing the whole structure to vibrate and the power to go 
          out. And this was just one of many sightings occurring in this area at that time.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO WITH A MESSAGE</b>. The <b>night of December 12, 1967</b> would change the life 
          of Rita Malley forever. As she drove with her young son near Ithaca, New York, a UFO began to 
          follow her down the highway. Suddenly it struck her car with a beam of light, pulling it off 
          the road. Then chorus of voices spoke to her, delivering a message that would chill her to 
          the bone. The very next day, Rita learned that the message from the UFO was absolutely 
          accurate. This case was just one of hundreds in the same area around the same time.</p>

          <p><b>A VERY HOT UFO</b>. Around <b>10:50 pm on August 13, 1970</b>, patrolman Evald Maarup 
          was driving near Haderslev, Denmark when his car and the surrounding area became illuminated 
          by a blindingly brilliant light. As the engine and electrical system failed, Evald looked up 
          and saw a UFO right above his car. Suddenly the interior of his vehicle became hot as a summer 
          day. As it finally darted away, he managed to capture three photos of the object. Soon the 
          UFOs would return, not only to him, but to others!</p>

          <p><b>A SILVER UFO WITH PRONGS</b>. One <b>evening in October 1973</b>, Mary Rose and her 
          11-year-old son Teddy were walking near their home in Wilcoe, West Virginia when a UFO 
          dropped down and hovered a telephone-pole height overhead. Fear filled them as they watched 
          two prong-like things come out from the bottom of the craft. Both could feel a weird sensation 
          of heat and electricity, and thought that they were about to be taken into the craft. They 
          ran and hid, and to their relief, the UFO darted away.</p>

          <p><b>STRUCK BY A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM A UFO</b>. Around <b>dusk on June 17, 1977</b>, Dale 
          Schexnaider, and two children, Jena (age 14) and Krissy (age 11) were walking to their car 
          at Cotile Lake in Louisiana when a UFO appeared. Suddenly it came right over their heads, 
          sending down multiple beams of light which struck them on the solar plexus. They were unable 
          to move and saw with shock that their entire bodies were glowing with electric-blue light. 
          Hours later, a tragic event occurred which seemed connected to their sighting in some 
          indefinable way.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN FOOTPRINTS?</b> On the <b>night of September 4, 1979</b>, Jerzy Wasilewski 
          left his 4th floor apartment in Wroclaw, Poland to take a short walk. He left his kitchen 
          window open. Returning later, he was shocked to see 17 strange footprints leading from the 
          open window, meandering around his kitchen and hallway, and going back to the open window. 
          The prints looked like burn-marks from some strange creature. But a later analysis revealed 
          that these prints were something much more strange and inexplicable.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS TRYING HARD TO HOLD ONTO REALITY</b>. On the <b>night of March 8, 1982</b>, 
          “John” and his wife were in their home in Bethel, Connecticut when the whole house began 
          to shake. Fearing an earthquake, they ran outside only to be confronted by a massive 
          shadowy object with scores of tiny red lights lining its edges. John later found out that 
          there were dozens of other witnesses in the area, some who saw the same object and also 
          reported very strange effects.</p>

          <p><b>HIGH STRANGENESS IN SLOCINA</b>. At <b>10:42 pm on December 27, 2013</b>, Ewa looked 
          outside the window of her home in Slocina, Poland and saw a huge glowing UFO at treetop 
          level. She called to her mother, Anna and both watched the object approach. Suddenly the 
          sound from their loud radio disappeared and time seemed to move in slow motion. As the craft 
          passed over a streetlamp, it pulled the light away from the streetlamp, as if it had some 
          kind of forcefield that could bend light.</p>

          <p>These eight case, all close encounters of the second kind, show that UFOs can affect 
          the environment (and the witnesses) in weird and unusual ways that defy comprehension. 
          Cases like these have much to teach us about these strange craft visiting our planet, 
          and the behavior of the occupants inside them.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A close encounter of third kind: meetings with humanoids. 
          This happens more often than most people think. There are thousands upon thousands of 
          cases on record, coming from all over the world. This episode presents ten cases of 
          extraterrestrial humanoid encounters you probably haven’t heard before. Short and tall 
          humanoids, human-looking ETs, robotic beings, grays…and more. Each case reveals 
          remarkable insights into the nature of UFO contact, what they are doing, and why they 
          are here.</p>

          <p><b>PLANT-PICKING ETS</b>. One <b>morning in July 1954</b>, Harold Carpenter woke up 
          to hear a buzzing noise coming from the woods near his home in Temple Ewell, England. 
          When it happened several times, he went to investigate, and came upon a landed UFO and 
          five short humanoids. They were using tweezer-like instruments to place twigs and leaves 
          in small jars. Seeing Harold, they fled into their craft, and flew off.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING ABNORMAL</b>. Driving near Girona, Spain one <b>night in October 
          1958</b>, Jose Luis Angelo observed a UFO descend into the forest. Suspecting a plane 
          crash, he pulled over and ventured into the forest. Instead, he came upon a UFO 
          hovering above the ground. Next to it were two short, large-headed humanoids wearing 
          jumpsuits. He watched for 15 minutes until they returned to their craft and departed.</p>

          <p><b>I WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE!</b> As 13-year-old Maria Ivanovna returned to her home 
          in Vitebsk, Belarus one day in <b>July of 1963</b>, she saw two metallic discs overhead. 
          Suddenly her 4-year-old brother ran towards them, and one of the discs swooped down 
          apparently to pick him up. Maria’s sister grabbed him and pulled him away just in time. 
          But they were all close enough to see a four-foot-tall humanoid sitting inside a 
          transparent dome on top of the craft.</p>

          <p><b>THE WINSTED ENCOUNTERS</b>. On the <b>night of September 15, 1967</b>, two 
          teen-age girls looked out the window and saw a glowing UFO crisscrossing the fields 
          behind one of their homes in Winsted, Connecticut. Moments later, they heard a noise 
          in the barn, and saw two short humanoids with big heads run across their yard. Soon 
          a third one appeared. This was just the first of a wave of encounters that put 
          Winsted on the UFO map.</p>

          <p><b>BLUE RIDGE HUMANOID</b>. On the <b>night of March 1, 1974</b>, Billy Wayne 
          Plasters saw an odd glow on the hill near his farm in Vesta, Virginia. Alerting his 
          family, they all observed a strange craft ascend and dart away. When the strange glow 
          remained, Billy and his brother-in-law drove to the area and came upon a landed craft 
          and a tall “well-built” humanoid. They tried to talk to it, but when it moved towards 
          them, they panicked and fled. Later, they found a huge burned spot.</p>

          <p><b>THE SHINY SILVER SEWICKLEY HUMANOID</b>. In <b>January of 1974</b>, numerous 
          people across central Pennsylvania reported UFOs. Many reported that they were chased 
          down the highway by strange craft. But events came to a climax on the <b>night of March 
          24</b> when a young man was motorcycling in a rural area of Sewickley and caught a tall, 
          silver-clad humanoid figure by surprise. The figure crouched and then darted away, 
          leaving behind strange footprints.</p>

          <p><b>THE SWEET-SMELLING ALIEN</b>. Hearing footsteps outside his home in Villorba, 
          Italy on the <b>night of June 25, 1974</b>, Mr. DP went outside and saw his cat was 
          bristling with fear. He also smelled a strange sweet odor. Sensing a presence, he was 
          then shocked by the appearance of a glowing humanoid in a shiny skin-tight jumpsuit. 
          The strange being quickly floated up into the sky and was gone. Mr. DP was stunned 
          and after his encounter, had a headache that persisted for a full week.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET WITH THE FLASHING EYES</b>. At <b>9pm one evening in July 1975</b>, Carmen 
          B stepped outside of her home in St. Dizier, France to hang her laundry. Without 
          warning, the yard was flooded with light. Turning around, she saw a short humanoid 
          staring at her. It had a huge head and large flashing eyes that left her hypnotized 
          and paralyzed with fear. She almost fainted from shock, but managed to break free and 
          flee into the house.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS IN THE FOREST</b>. On the <b>afternoon of February 14, 1984</b>, a group 
          of young children playing in the Tuchola Forest near their homes in Linowek, Poland saw 
          a small craft descend downward. At least two metallic-looking short humanoids frightened 
          the children who fled to their homes. Investigators had the children draw what they saw. 
          Later, landing traces were found.</p>

          <p><b>AN INTERRUPTED JOURNEY</b>. At <b>4:30 pm on August 25, 1999</b>, mechanic Carlos 
          Colon’s truck mysteriously stalled along National Route 5 near Trenque Lauquen, 
          Argentina. Five tall figures in a glowing dome appeared in front of him. Suddenly, the 
          beings turned away and they disappeared. Carlos found himself standing in a field some 
          distance away. After the encounter, numerous psychic and paranormal events occurred.</p>

          <p>Ten more cases showing once more that we are not alone in the Universe. It’s time for 
          the world to face this fact. UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are here!</p>

          <h5>Sep 20, 2024 (1:14:12)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to Episode Four of my ongoing series of “UFOS IN YOUR 
          HOMETOWN.” I have put out a challenge to anyone interested in this subject: name any 
          location, such as your hometown, and I bet I can find a UFO encounter there. Hundreds 
          of people responded. I am working my way down the list of locations. In this episode 
          I investigate eight places: Fort Wayne, IN - Greenock, Scotland - Warsaw, Poland - 
          New Paltz, NY - St Charles, MO - Boston, MA - Van Horn, TX - Grand Junction, CO. 
          And guess what? There are cases in each of these areas! Sightings, landings, humanoids, 
          onboard encounters…supported by eyewitness testimonies, photos, radar-returns, landing 
          traces, medical effects and more. Has your hometown been visited? The answer is probably 
          YES!</p>

          <p><b>FORT WAYNE, INDIANA</b>. On <b>February 7, 1955</b>, American Airlines Flight 266 
          had a dramatic encounter with five UFO. In <b>1955</b>, the Freeman family of Fort Wayne 
          all watched a classic flying saucer. In <b>1967</b>, minister Allen Federspiel reported 
          his amazing sighting to NICAP. That same year, dozens of people saw a UFO hovering over 
          Fort Wayne for four hours. In <b>1979</b>, Sally Collet saw a UFO with a humanoid inside 
          it right outside her home, and she wasn’t the only one. In <b>1991</b>, a lady in Fort 
          Wayne was chased by a UFO for 25 minutes. In <b>2005</b>, another witness had a dramatic 
          missing time encounter. The cases continue!</p>

          <p><b>GREENOCK, SCOTLAND</b>. Sightings, UFO fleets, humanoids, UFO photos…Greenock has 
          them all. Back in <b>1948</b>, two schoolgirls saw multiple UFOs hover overhead. One 
          hovered so low, they could see a humanoid figure inside. They waved at it, and it waved 
          back! Truly dramatic low-level sightings occurred in <b>1973, 1978 and 1999</b>, 
          including a case involving a fleet of UFOs. In <b>2005</b>, Jonathan Smith heard 
          shouting in the street and looking out his window, saw a group of colorful objects. 
          He grabbed his camera and snapped an amazing photograph. These are just a few of the 
          many cases in Greenock.</p>

          <p><b>WARSAW, POLAND</b>. Warsaw has an astonishing number of close encounter cases. In 
          <b>1922</b>, a Warsaw family observed a silver craft hover 400 feet away, so close, 
          they thought they were about to be taken onboard. In <b>1959</b>, an engineer observed 
          a craft hovering over the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science. In <b>1975</b>, a man was 
          in the forests outside of Warsaw when he saw two gray-type ETs who rendered him 
          temporarily paralyzed. In <b>1979</b>, a man came so close to a landed craft, it 
          burned his face. In <b>1986</b>, a plumber was taken onboard a craft where he saw 
          froglike beings. So many other cases!</p>

          <p><b>NEW PALTZ, NEW YORK</b>. Per whistleblower Robert S. Carr, a UFO landed in New 
          Paltz, and a humanoid was captured by a game warden, and was taken alive to CIA 
          headquarters in Langley, Virginia until it died. This is one of many New Paltz cases. 
          In 1970, a woman and her boyfriend had a dramatic missing time encounter. Another 
          dramatic case occurred in 1978 when three separate groups of witnesses observed a 
          strange triangular craft over the city.</p>

          <p><b>ST CHARLES, MISSOURI</b>. One <b>morning in 1971</b>, three people, including 
          a doctor, observed a low-level cone-shaped craft with a humanoid inside it. In 
          <b>1973</b>, the police received a call from a UFO witness. They sent out an officer, 
          and he saw it himself. Soon many other witnesses saw it. In <b>1998</b>, a witness 
          described his sighting of a cigar-shaped craft with portholes on it.</p>

          <p><b>BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS</b>. Sightings here reach back to <b>1638</b>, when a 
          group of witnesses saw a UFO for three hours. In <b>1950</b>, a dramatic UFO display 
          involving multiple craft occurred over Logan International Airport. In <b>1955</b>, a 
          man reported his sighting of a craft as big as a 10-story building. In <b>May 1963</b>, 
          a group of witnesses witnessed a fleet of UFOs over a drive-in theater. In <b>2024</b>, 
          a boyfriend and a girlfriend were stunned when a UFO shined a beam of light on their 
          car, causing it to noticeably shake.</p>

          <p><b>VAN HORN, TEXAS</b>. This small town had an undeniable encounter with a classic 
          flying saucer when, on <b>July 23, 1999</b>, truckers driving along Interstate 10 
          observed a craft with blue and white lights zigzagging at low level alongside the 
          highway.</p>

          <p><b>GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO</b>. In <b>1956</b>, four people were shocked by the 
          appearance of metallic discs flying only 1500 feet overhead. In <b>1968</b>, a man 
          driving near Grand Junction saw a UFO that was so bright, it hurt his eyes to look 
          at it. In <b>1969</b>, two young men were walking down Main Street when a silver 
          saucer with windows hovered for two minutes in view of hundreds of people. In 
          <b>1985</b>, Bob White was driving outside of Grand Junction when a UFO ejected a 
          piece of metal right in front of him. He scooped it up, and had it studied by 
          metallurgists who were unable to account for its composition. These are just a few 
          of the many fascinating cases in Grand Junction.</p>

          <p>It appears that every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO 
          encounters. The evidence speaks for itself. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <h5>Sep 13, 2024 (0:59:47)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">An onboard UFO encounter is the most extensive of all UFO 
          cases, and there are a lot of them. According to the Roper Polling organization, as 
          many as one in fifty people show the markers of being UFO contactees. An onboard 
          experience is far more common than most people know, and the fact is, most people 
          remain silent about their encounters. This video presents six incredible accounts 
          from across the world of people who have been onboard an extraterrestrial craft. 
          These cases are not only fascinating, they have a lot to teach us about the ET 
          agenda.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN CALGARY</b>. At <b>5:45 pm on November 16, 1967</b>, fourteen-year-old 
          David Seewaldt was walking to his home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It should have been 
          a three-minute walk. But suddenly a craft covered with colored lights appeared overhead 
          and struck him with a beam of light. Running home, he realized he was missing forty 
          minutes of time. Then, six months later, he had a dream where he remembered what 
          happened during the missing time: he was taken onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he 
          recalled all the details, including being pulled onboard and being examined by reptilian-
          like entities.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN LOXLEY</b>. On <b>October 17, 1973</b>, Clarence Ray Patterson (a 31-
          year-old electrician) was driving his pickup truck eastbound on Highway 10 near Loxley, 
          Alabama when a cigar-shaped craft appeared overhead. It sent down a beam of light and 
          pulled Clarence and his truck onboard. Inside the craft, Clarence was confronted by six 
          robotic-like entities who pulled him from the truck and proceeded to examine him. 
          Twenty minutes later, Clarence and his truck were set down 29 miles away, now in 
          Florida. Unknown to Clarence, scores of people across the southwest saw UFOs and 
          humanoids on that same night.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN VENADO TUERTO</b>. At <b>6:45 am on September 6, 1978</b>, twelve-year-
          old Juan Oscar Perez exited his ranch-house in Venado Tuerto, Argentina to round up the 
          family’s horses. Suddenly a UFO appeared overhead, spooking the horses. Juan fled home 
          in fear, but his father made him return to the area to collect the horses. Going to the 
          horse pasture, Juan came upon a landed craft. A door opened and out stepped a tall 
          robotic figure who invited Juan onboard the craft. Juan accepted the invitation and saw 
          strange instruments and panels and another short robotic figure. As Juan left, he asked 
          for an artifact to prove his encounter. The ET gave him a glove, but as he fled, they 
          took the glove back. Both before and after Juan’s encounter, others in the area also 
          had encounters with UFOs and humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN SOMMERECOURT</b>. On <b>July 8, 1983</b>, Stefan Gasparovic and his 
          family went camping in the hills near their home in Sommerecourt, Haute-Marne, France. 
          That night, a brilliant object appeared overhead, coming back three times. The next night 
          it appeared again, frightening the family. But on <b>July 10</b>, Stefan returned alone 
          for a closer look. To his shock, the UFO appeared and dropped down right over his head. 
          He found himself being pulled onboard. The next thing he knew, he was being dropped out 
          of the craft several kilometers away, with vague memories of being examined by short, 
          ugly humanoids. He was so traumatized, he couldn’t recall his own name and had to be 
          hospitalized. Later, landing traces were found in the field where he was taken.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN GOODLAND</b>. On the <b>evening of November 7, 1989</b>, friends Susan 
          and Jennifer were driving between Flagler, Colorado and Goodland, Kansas when a UFO 
          began to pace their car down the highway. At one point, it came close to their car and 
          shone down a beam of light. The women kept driving and arrived at a motel in Goodland. 
          That’s when they realized that a 72-mile trip had somehow taken three hours. Realizing 
          they had missing time, they went under hypnosis, and both independently recalled being 
          pulled from their car and taken onboard the craft, where they were separated and 
          physical examined by gray ETs. Both held conversations with the ETs and learned the 
          reasons behind their encounter.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN DEBRECEN</b>. Late one <b>evening in December 1990</b>, teacher and 
          artist Gabor Molnar was driving along Highway 35 near Debrecen, Hungary when his engine 
          mysteriously quit and his car stopped. Suddenly he saw a “little green being” facing 
          him from the roadside. The next thing he knew, he found himself inside a craft being 
          examined by these beings with large black eyes. He blacked out and woke up back on the 
          road with his car facing the wrong direction. His life would never be the same.</p>

          <p>These six cases show what it’s like to be taken onboard a craft and examined by ETs. 
          They provide some answers as to what happens inside a UFO, and why people are being 
          taken onboard. They show how profoundly an encounter can affect a person in many ways. 
          And most importantly, they add to our knowledge of this subject and provide further 
          evidence that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

          <h5>Sep 6, 2024 (1:01:15)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Seeing a UFO is an incredible experience. But far more 
          shocking is having a very close encounter with a humanoid extraterrestrial. When 
          someone has very close face-to-face contact, there is no chance of misperception. It 
          is an undeniable experience that instantly changes a person’s worldview. This video 
          presents ten shocking cases of people who have had direct contact with UFO occupants. 
          The cases span from 1923 to 2012, come from across the planet, and involve a wide 
          variety of humanoids. These cases are supported by multiple eyewitness testimonies, 
          radar returns, photographs, landing traces and more.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS</b>. One <b>summer morning in June 1923</b>, ten-year-old 
          Norman Wilson Massie went outside his home in Mount Erie, Illinois to check on the 
          family’s horses. To his shock, he came upon a landed UFO with five little blond men, 
          each about four feet tall. They rushed back and forth, apparently repairing their 
          craft. After five minutes, the craft flew away. Norman told his family, but nobody 
          else for many years.</p>

          <p><b>MANY SURPRISES AWAIT TERRESTRIALS</b>. It was a <b>summer morning in 1945</b> 
          when nine-year-old I. Chebotaryov went fishing along the shores of Taganrog Bay in 
          the Sea of Azov, Russia. He was about to return home when a silver craft dropped from 
          the sky and landed in the water just off shore. A silver-suited humanoid exited and 
          approached the witness, saying that he came from another planet, and invited the 
          witness to come onboard.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOIDS VISIT A NAVY SHIP</b>. In <b>1952</b>, the USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
          aircraft carrier had the first of what would be ten separate visitations by UFOs. This 
          first encounter involved a metallic disk, as did a second and third encounter in 1956. 
          In 1958, Navy officer Chester Grusinski was on deck when another craft appeared, and 
          through the portholes he and many others saw alien figures looking down at them. The 
          event was covered up as were the previous and future encounters.</p>

          <p><b>THE DOCTOR AND THE ALIEN</b>. On <b>August 26, 1966</b>, Dr. Juan Jose Rivera 
          was driving his motorbike near Punta Carnero, Spain when he saw a monkey-like figure 
          wearing a jumpsuit float across the road ahead of him. He chased it down a hill to a 
          landed flying saucer. He snapped one quick photograph before fleeing the scene in panic.</p>

          <p><b>THE HUMANOIDS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW</b>. At <b>10pm on January 29, 1967</b>, Enid 
          Campbell looked out the window of her home in Knox City, Missouri to see a white 
          spherical-shaped object approach her home and hover in her backyard. Looking inside, 
          she saw two beings wearing “shiny silvery wetsuits.” She alerted her two children who 
          also saw the craft. Afterward, they found burned vegetation in the backyard.</p>

          <p><b>UFO AND HUMANOIDS LAND BY A TRAIN</b>. On <b>April 20, 1967</b>, several railway 
          employees riding past the Casalegno Station in Argentina were shocked to see a strange 
          craft with multicolored lights and tiny three-foot-tall humanoid alongside the railroad 
          tracks. They slowed down the train and watched in shock as these beings moved hastily 
          around the craft. They discovered that an earlier train had also seen the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>WE DID NOT LOOK BACK</b>. At <b>3am on September 30, 1968</b>, two young men were 
          walking along a rural road near Roncenay, France when a glowing red UFO flew across the 
          sky ahead of them. Coming around a corner, they saw that the craft had landed and two 
          little humanoids were floating around it, shining flashlights on the ground. Then one 
          of the humanoids approached to within 15 feet. The men fled in fear.</p>

          <p><b>ROCK COLLECTING ALIENS</b>. Around <b>dusk one evening in 1976</b>, nine-year-old 
          Hercilio da Costa was walking to her home in rural San Goncalo do Amarante, Brazil when 
          she walked right up to a landed UFO. Seven human-looking figures in dark jumpsuits stood 
          around it. One was collecting small stones and putting them in a sac. When one of the 
          beings spoke, Hercilio fled in fear. Later, landing traces were found.</p>

          <p><b>THE FLOATING HUMANOID</b>. At <b>1:30 am on December 30, 1979</b>, Sebastiano 
          Pannitteri woke up in his home in Sicily, Italy to his dog barking and his bedroom 
          filling with light. Rushing to the window, he was awestruck to see a short humanoid 
          dressed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, floating in his yard. It remained there for 
          five minutes before gliding away and disappearing behind a wall.</p>

          <p><b>TWO ALIENS ABOVE SECOND STREET</b>. On the <b>night of May 25, 2012</b>, six people 
          in two cars were traveling west on Highway 7 in Clinton, Missouri when their journey was 
          interrupted by an unusual sight: a large craft with glowing portholes was hovering just 
          above 2nd Street. The witnesses were frightened to see two skinny humanoids looking out 
          the window. More sightings soon followed.</p>

          <p>So many cases of humanoid encounters! These ten cases may be shocking, but they are 
          just the tip of the iceberg. These kinds of events are much more common than most people 
          know. And they have lots to tell us about what’s out there beyond Earth. Are we ready to 
          learn?</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Despite what skeptics may claim, or any denials from our 
          own govts, the thousands of firsthand cases of close encounters with humanoids speak 
          for themselves: we are being visited by extraterrestrials. These visitors to Earth 
          have been coming for a very long time. This video presents ten incredible humanoid 
          encounters from many locations including France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Indonesia, 
          Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States. Evidence such as landing traces, 
          medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and radar returns 
          prove that these visitors to Earth are very real indeed.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT</b>. At <b>6:35 am on April 3, 1948</b>, driver 
          Giuseppe Lanciano waited for the arrival of a train at San Martino, Italy. Suddenly 
          his attention was drawn to a disc-shaped object, glowing orange, which zoomed silently 
          overhead. He was joined by another witness and both watched as a beam came out of the 
          bottom, carrying a short robotic-looking humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>WENDY AND THE ALIENS</b>. Early one <b>morning in June of 1949</b>, Wanda M’s 
          father came running into their home in Dunino, Poland shouting that a strange craft 
          had landed in their yard. He, their neighbors, and Wanda ran outside to see two 
          humanoids in jumpsuits standing next to a large silver-brown, cone-shaped object. 
          The beings spoke a strange language, gestured, and then returned to their craft. It 
          took off, leaving behind landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>ALMOST ABDUCTED</b>. On the <b>night of February 5, 1967</b>, Timothy J. (age 15) 
          was drawn outside his home in Hilliard, Ohio by a weird sound, and the barking of his 
          dog. He was shocked to see a 75-foot-long craft fly by and land in a field. He watched 
          as several figures came out and placed small spheres on the ground. Then Timothy stepped 
          on a twig and the men heard him, came running and tried to pull him onto the craft.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO IN THE BACKYARD</b>. At <b>8:15 pm on July 20, 1967</b>, Elizabeth Douglas 
          stepped outside her home in Titusville, Florida and saw a 60-foot wide, bell-shaped 
          craft floating silently overhead. Looking through one of the windows, she saw the 
          silhouette of a large-headed, skinny figure looking down at her. She called out her 
          daughter who also saw it. Inside, her son Steven wondered why his TV suddenly 
          malfunctioned.</p>

          <p><b>I KNOW WHAT I SAW</b>. One <b>morning in the summer of 1972</b>, “Patricia,” (age 
          13,) was sitting in the backseat of the family car as they drove south of Molong, 
          Australia when she saw a saucer-shaped craft sitting alongside the highway. Three 
          7-foot-tall silver-suited humanoids stood next to it, collecting samples. One looked 
          directly at her as their car drove by.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN AND THE SNOWMOBILER</b>. On the <b>evening of February 26, 1973</b>, 
          Helene R, her brothers and friends were finishing up a day of snowmobiling in the 
          McWatters area of Quebec, Canada, when a brilliant object zoomed overhead. While the 
          others raced off, Helene was left alone. The strange craft returned and apparently 
          landed. Helene then had a very scary encounter with a short humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>THE GIANT HUMANOID</b>. On the <b>night of July 1, 1979</b>, four teenage boys 
          went hunting in the mountains near their homes in Sangonera La Verde, Spain. Suddenly 
          a UFO blocked their way. They watched it for an hour when suddenly a 7-8 foot-tall 
          humanoid wearing shiny tight-fitting clothes began to approach. The boys zoomed away 
          in fear. They returned to town as they and others watched the UFO dart away.</p>

          <p><b>“I AM CERTAIN THAT I SAW AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT.”</b> On the <b>night of 
          January 4, 1994</b>, the Noel family of Evreux, France reported their encounter with 
          a black, triangular object. A few hours later, Didier Maury of Bacqueville had a scary 
          encounter with a glowing cone-shaped object and an apparent humanoid. Hours after that, 
          the Lopez family watched a UFO land next to their home and humanoids come out of it. 
          These are only a few of an amazing series of events that occurred on that night and 
          afterward.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE PALM PLANTATION</b>. One <b>evening in April 2008</b>, a man saw a 
          UFO drop from the sky and into the Palm tree plantation near his home in Bankinang, 
          Indonesia. Hopping on his motorbike to investigate, he was shocked to come upon a 
          6-foot-tall humanoid with a bald head, pointed ears, a skinny body and long arms 
          dressed only in underwear and standing a short distance away. It quickly vanished.</p>

          <p><b>THE MAGNETIC MAN</b>. On the <b>night of May 21, 2008</b>, Walter Lopez and Omar 
          Ferlatti were in a field near San Carlos, Salta, Argentina when they saw a tiny 
          two-foot-tall humanoid figure wearing strange clothes standing nearby. They tried to 
          get closer but were repelled by some kind of magnetic field. It turned out another 
          person also saw the humanoid, and numerous people in the area were reporting UFOs.</p>

          <p>Ten humanoid encounters, each adding to the catalog of thousands of similar cases, 
          each providing more evidence that our planet is being visited by a wide variety of
          extraterrestrial humanoids.</p>

          <h5>Aug 23, 2024 (1:10:16)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Has every location on our planet been visited by UFOs? The 
          answer appears to be a resounding: yes! I put out a challenge to anyone interested in 
          this subject: name a town or city anywhere on this planet, and I will find a UFO case 
          there. Hundreds of people have responded, and so far, every place I have investigated 
          has a history of UFOs and extraterrestrials. In Part Three of this series, “UFOs in 
          Your Hometown,” we continue the search for UFOs across planet Earth, covering nine 
          different locations, including Ealing, London (UK,); Frankfort, IN; Warrenton, MO; 
          Santa Clarita, CA; Milwaukee, WI; Roseville, CA; Show Low, AZ; Littleton, MA and 
          Bastrop, TX. These cases include the full range of UFO activity: sighting, landings, 
          humanoids, onboard encounters, even a possible UFO crash.</p>

          <p><b>EALING, LONDON, UK</b>. Way back in <b>1845</b>, numerous people reported seeing 
          a humanoid wearing skintight overalls and a transparent helmet leaping over walls far 
          faster than a human. There’s also the <b>1978</b> sighting of a classic flying saucer that 
          the witness felt was meant for him to see. Or the gentleman who saw a boomerang-shaped 
          craft during a lunar eclipse in <b>2015</b>. And more!</p>

          <p><b>FRANKFORT, INDIANA</b>. Starting in <b>1953</b>, Frankfort has been the location 
          of constant UFO activity. Sightings continued throughout the <b>1950s</b>, culminating 
          in a fantastic encounter in <b>1958</b> when four UFOs played hide-and-seek with a 
          diesel train for over an hour. In <b>1977</b>, four people reported a scary encounter 
          where they were followed by a UFO. In <b>1981</b>, numerous people throughout Frankfort, 
          including police, had amazing encounters, showing once again that UFOs are very 
          interested in Frankfort.</p>

          <p><b>WARRENTON, MISSOURI</b>. An incredible <b>1969</b> encounter by a technical 
          illustrator in Warrenton, MO is only one of several amazing cases. Another case 
          involved a couple who had a very close encounter with a craft that hovered right 
          above a highway overpass. In <b>2019</b>, a couple were shocked to see a UFO cloaked 
          inside a cloud come right over their home. They may have also seen humanoids!</p>

          <p><b>SANTA CLARITA, CALIFORNIA</b>. This town outside of Los Angeles, CA has some 
          very dramatic cases. On July 13, 1979, Ed and Gloria Towers were shocked to see a 
          metallic saucer target their home, hovering only 50 feet overhead. A very similar 
          case happened to another Santa Clarita family in <b>2015</b> when a giant boomerang-
          shaped craft went right over their house. And more!</p>

          <p><b>MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN</b>. Sightings in this city reach back to <b>1896</b> with 
          the famous airship wave. Throughout <b>1952</b>, numerous city officials reported very 
          dramatic sightings of solid craft darting around in the sky in some cases for hours at 
          a time. More dramatic sightings occurred throughout the <b>1960s</b> and <b>1970s</b>. 
          In <b>1980</b>, an attorney reports that he was taken onboard a craft and met human-
          looking ETs. Sightings continued up to the present day, including a case of a UFO 
          photograph in 2022.</p>

          <p><b>ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA</b>. Several amazing multiple-witness sightings of disc-shaped 
          craft have occurred in this town. There’s also the case of a lady who was taken onboard a 
          craft in <b>2004</b>. In <b>2016</b>, a highway patrol officer reported a dramatic 
          encounter with a low-flying triangle. In <b>2022</b>, a woman was puzzled by two 
          objects hovering outside her home and managed to take two photos!</p>

          <p><b>SHOW LOW, ARIZONA</b>. In the <b>summer of 1988</b>, a woman woke up in her hotel 
          room to see two unusual-looking ETs come through the wall, stand at the foot of her bed, 
          and communicate telepathically with her. Just north of Show Low in the small town of 
          Concho, a woman and her friends saw a UFO drop from the sky. They drove to the location, 
          and came upon what appeared to be the craft stuck in a ravine.</p>

          <p><b>LITTLETON, MASSACHUSETTS</b>. Amazing sightings occurred here, including a <b>1954</b> 
          low-level sighting of a Saturn-shaped object, a multi-witness sighting of a classic saucer 
          in <b>1964</b>, a sighting by two men of an object over a highway involving the strange 
          “Oz Factor,” and a <b>2015</b> sighting directly over the local police station.</p>

          <p><b>BASTROP/BERGSTROM AFB, TEXAS</b>. In <b>1947</b> two Air Force officers at 
          Bergstrom saw a silver saucer flying at 1,400 mph, overtaking their plane. In <b>1965</b>, 
          two Bergstrom officer with Top Secret clearances saw a craft with portholes right over the 
          base. They told nobody. In <b>1980</b>, a newsman and his wife had a dramatic sighting 
          right outside Bastrop. In <b>1988</b>, a UFO came so close to a Bastrop man that he shot at 
          it with his gun. More dramatic cases continued in <b>2013 and 2014</b>.</p>

          <p>These are just some of the many amazing encounters that have occurred in these nine 
          locations. Firsthand cases reaching back a hundred years up to the present day, multiple 
          witnesses, a wide variety of evidence to support them: the truth can no longer be denied. 
          The cases speak for themselves. We are not alone. Our planet is being visited; apparently 
          every location on our planet! Including your own hometown!</p>

          <h5>Aug 16, 2024 (1:02:16)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Few experiences are as astounding as a direct face-to-face 
          encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid from another world. And yet, the number 
          of cases is far greater than most people think. They have been reported for well over 
          a hundred years and probably into antiquity. Cases come from all over the world. This 
          video presents ten little known cases, each one adding to our knowledge of ET contact. 
          There are far too many cases to be explained away as hoaxes, hallucinations, or 
          misperceptions.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ETS AND THE SAUCER</b>. On the <b>afternoon of May 5, 1954</b>, eight-year-old 
          Arnaldo Ribeiro de Freitas was goat-herding near his home in Fregim, Portugal when 
          an odd sound alerted him to two UFOs hovering nearby. One flew off, but the other 
          remained, and Arnaldo could see two big-headed humanoids sitting inside it. And one 
          was looking right at him! After it departed, it left weird landing traces on the 
          ground.</p>
          
          <p><b>ANOTHER ALIEN MICHELIN MAN</b>. One <b>afternoon in May of 1960</b>, Professor 
          Miguel Timermans Ceballos was driving his motorcycle near Cadiz, Spain. Looking ahead, 
          he saw a strange humanoid figure which looked very much like the famous Michelin Man. 
          Seconds later, a second figure appeared. Both walked clumsily across the road before 
          disappearing into the brush. Miguel was convinced they were not human.</p>
          
          <p><b>IT WASN’T ANYTHING HUMAN</b>. Late in the <b>evening of October 23, 1963</b>, 
          Robert W. Smith drove in a rural area of South River, NJ when he saw something odd in 
          the beams of his car headlights: three very short humanoid figures dressed in tight-fitting, 
          silver, one-piece suits. They darted across the road far faster than a human could move. 
          Robert was too frightened to stop. It was an experience he would never forget.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE FLOATING HUMANOID OF COFICO</b>. On <b>July 2, 1968</b>, numerous residents of 
          Cofico, Argentina observed UFOs and/or humanoids hovering overhead. Three witnesses at 
          one home described a glowing humanoid figure floating in the air. Another witness 
          described a 9-foot-tall robotic figure, also floating in the sky. Another witness in 
          a different home described the same thing. Even policemen witnessed strange activity.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE JAY-WALKING ALIENS</b>. In <b>early May of 1969</b>, numerous residents in 
          Rockville, Virginia started seeing UFOs darting around overhead. But on the <b>night 
          of May 11, 1969</b>, Mike Luczkowich saw actual humanoids. Driving along Route 622, he 
          saw what he first thought were two deer. Instead, he realized they were four-foot-tall 
          humanoids with giant heads. They crossed the road in front of him, followed by a third 
          one.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE DUMBBELL ETS</b>. On the <b>night of October 24, 1976</b>, Romeo Lucarelli and 
          his young daughter were driving to their home in Hobling, France when a brilliant light 
          appeared ahead of them. It zoomed towards them and revealed itself to be a dumbbell-shaped 
          object with two humanoid figures inside. To Romeo’s fear, the craft followed them home. 
          His wife ran out just in time to see the UFO dart away.</p>
          
          <p><b>IT DIDN’T SEEM LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.</b> On the <b>night of January 21, 1977</b>, 
          Juan Pedro Hernandez of Camuy, Puerto Rico was shocked to see an ET craft hovering at 
          low altitude overhead. Inside he saw a skinny figure with a big head and dark eyes 
          looking at him. Suddenly he was struck a beam of light from the UFO. The beam 
          retracted and the UFO departed. Juan followed, but govt agents appeared, blocking his 
          way.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE UFO GNOME</b>. In <b>late March of 1978</b>, Constantina Imbibos and her 
          husband began seeing UFOs behind their home in Villamare Di Sapri, Italy. After 
          several sightings, on <b>April 25,1978</b>, Constantina saw another UFO, and seconds 
          later, a strange gnome-like humanoid wearing an orange suit and pointed hat. It bounced 
          around like a gnome. Soon more UFOs would be seen, and more gnome-like entities.</p>
          
          <p><b>AN 8-FOOT-TALL GRAY</b>. On the <b>night of July 31, 2018</b>, a military veteran 
          with a Top Secret clearance was driving on State Route 13 just north of Mount Vernon, 
          Ohio when an eight-foot-tall, incredibly thin, hairless humanoid crossed the road in 
          front of him. It had black eyes, a small mouth and four fingers on each hand. It was 
          not human. Truly frightened, the witness decided not to stop.</p>
          
          <p><b>I SAW SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET</b>. Around <b>5am on July 16, 2020</b>, 
          Paul Froggatt was bicycling home from work in Warwick, UK when a UFO appeared. He 
          snapped two photos with his camera, but became frightened when the craft seemed to 
          follow him. Moments later he came face-to-face with a 7-foot-tall, praying mantis 
          humanoid. He was so frightened he began to cry. He fled the area, thoroughly 
          traumatized.</p>
          
          <p>As hard as it might be for some people to believe, the growing number of cases 
          involving humanoid encounters make it undeniable that we are being visited by 
          extraterrestrials. Thankfully, as the government UFO coverup collapses, and as 
          more people reveal their encounters, the truth is coming out. ETs are real! And 
          it’s time that all of humanity knows it.</p>

          <h5>Aug 9, 2024 (1:07:09)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A close encounter with a UFO, and especially humanoids, 
          challenges a person on multiple levels: physically, emotionally, mentally, and 
          spiritually. Almost without exception witnesses are left stunned, surprised, 
          bewildered. The ten cases presented in this video come from across the world and 
          involve a wide variety of humanoids. They contain a wide variety of evidence. And 
          each case shows how the witnesses are deeply and profoundly affected to a degree 
          that their lives are never the same.</p>
          
          <p><b>BLACK HOLE ALIENS</b>. On <b>August 26, 1974</b>, Jean Marie Bigorne stepped 
          outside his home in Feignies, France and saw a black hole in the gray night sky. As 
          it started to descend, he rushed inside, got his wife, and together they watched it 
          split into two half-circles. The right side disappeared, but the left side suddenly 
          revealed two robotic-looking humanoids. The witnesses became entranced and watched 
          it for 45 minutes until going inside. They never saw it leave.</p>
          
          <p><b>ALIENS IN THE ANDES</b>. On the <b>evening of February 17, 1981</b>, cattleman 
          Jose Fermin Albornoz was sleeping after protecting a herd of sheep in the Manzano-
          Amargo area of the Argentinian Andes. A brilliant light and buzzing noise woke him 
          up and he saw a saucer land next to his campsite. As the animals scattered, two 
          strange humanoids appeared and spoke to him in a strange language. Jose fainted in 
          fear.</p>
          
          <p><b>HUMANOIDS AT THE CAMPGROUND</b>. On <b>evening in 1981</b>, a group of people 
          were camping at Laguna Sofia National Park in Puerto Natales, Chile. One of the 
          campers stepped outside her tent and saw a strange craft drop from the sky and 
          land nearby. As she approached, a door opened and three tall humanoids exited and 
          began taking soil samples. She fled and woke everyone up in time to watch the craft 
          dart away.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE LIGHT-HEADED ALIEN</b>. On the night of October 9, 1984, doorman Isidoro 
          Ferri was woken up in his bedroom at the Villa La Radicchia in Polcanto, Italy by 
          a brilliant light streaming in through the window. Paralyzed, he saw that the light 
          was coming from the head of a humanoid standing outside. Shortly later, he saw a 
          craft. The light flashed and fluctuated, causing alarming physiological effects. 
          Afterwards, landing traces were found, and researchers found many other witnesses.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ALIENS AT SCHOOL</b>. One day in <b>June 1986</b>, “Leif” was parked next to a 
          school in Ytteroya, Norway when he noticed a three-foot-tall figure with a bald head and 
          huge dark eyes approach. It wore a shiny blue jumpsuit. Fifteen feet behind it was a 
          landed UFO. Leif hid behind the truck as the being turned around and re-entered the 
          craft. Two of the figures turned and stared at Leif as the craft rose into the sky and 
          departed.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE HUNTERS AND THE ALIENS</b>. On the <b>night of June 26, 1987</b>, three men 
          were hunting in the countryside near Badajoz, Spain when a brilliant light appeared in 
          the sky. It zoomed towards them and landed, disgorging two tall, strong-looking figures. 
          The two humanoids approached the hunters, who panicked and fled the scene. Moments later, 
          they saw the craft depart. Later, landing traces were found.</p>
          
          <p><b>KT & THE GRAYS</b>. One day in <b>May 1992</b>, wildlife researcher K.T. Frankovich 
          was walking her dogs through a lime grove next to her apartment in Miami-Dade, Florida. 
          Suddenly a gray alien appeared. K.T. watched it for several minutes, receiving several 
          telepathic messages before fleeing the scene. A few nights later, two grays appeared 
          outside her apartment with another profound message.</p>
          
          <p><b>HAVANA HUMANOID</b>. On the <b>morning of November 27, 1995</b>, security guard 
          Samuel Rodolfo Barreras was shocked to see a flying saucer approach and land next to 
          the buildings he was guarding outside of Havana City, Cuba. A door in the craft opened 
          and out stepped a robotic-looking humanoid who approached Samuel (who was now paralyzed.) 
          The being scanned the area for 15 minutes before returning to the craft, which promptly 
          departed.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE HUMANOID IN THE BATHROOM</b>. Late on the <b>night of June 24, 2001</b>, 
          Mr. G.H. a university professor from Patras, Greece, walked into his kitchen and was 
          confronted by a tall faceless humanoid wearing a shiny blue coverall. It ran into his 
          bathroom and disappeared. For the next few minutes, he chased it around the house, 
          back into the bathroom twice more until it was gone, leaving the witnesses utterly 
          bewildered.</p>
          
          <p><b>IT APPEARED THREE TIMES</b>. One <b>night in December 2001</b>, a young man was 
          watching TV alone in his family’s home in Tampa, Florida. Hearing an odd crinkling 
          sound outside, he looked and saw a gray ET standing in his backyard. It quickly 
          disappeared. Later, the witness heard the same sound again and saw that the ET had 
          returned to his backyard. Then the gray-skinned humanoid returned a third time.</p>
          
          <p>These ten cases show how incredibly strange a UFO/humanoid encounter can be, and how 
          profoundly it changes a person. Nobody but a firsthand witness can ever know what it’s 
          truly like to have an encounter with a humanoid from a UFO.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Humanoid encounters are far more numerous than you might 
          think. Cases come from across the world and have been occurring for a very long time. 
          It can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime! These cases make it clear that we still 
          have much to learn about the Universe we live in. This video presents ten cases of 
          people who have had face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials of many different 
          kinds.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MAN IN THE UFO</b>. One <b>night in December 1951</b>, the Coley family 
          of Red Springs, NC were amazed to see a UFO hovering near their home. More amazing, they 
          could see a humanoid figure inside. This was just the beginning. On <b>August 6, 1952</b>, 
          James J. Allen saw a craft land next to his home in nearby Lumberton. A short humanoid 
          figure emerged, quickly returned into the craft which took off. In 1975 a huge wave of 
          sightings occurred, and was observed by dozens of police officers. Along with it came 
          several more humanoid encounters.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE BLACK ALIENS</b>. On the <b>afternoon of October 9, 1957</b>, Marie 
          Yeager sat in her home in Mariaville, NY when a UFO landed in the forest near her home. 
          Moments later, it departed. But the next day it was back, and this time she saw little 
          black humanoids come out of it. She fled her home in fear. But soon she discovered that 
          other people in her area had also seen UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>FIVE SAUCERS AND SIX ALIENS</b>. On the <b>morning of November 18, 1957</b>, 
          tobacco farmers Pedro Zilli and Joao Ermani of Maracaja, Brazil were amazed to see 
          two silver craft landed in the fields next to their farm. As they approached, they 
          saw six tall humanoids dressed in skintight jumpsuits running inside the craft, which 
          promptly took off. Unknown to them, many other people in the area were also seeing 
          UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING WEIRD OVER DENMARK</b>. On <b>November 21, 1957</b>, grocer Hans 
          Haugaard Hansen was driving near Gesten, Denmark when he noticed a strange craft 
          hovering over a nearby turnip field. He stopped his car and was amazed to see two 
          human-looking figures inside a transparent cockpit. The craft quickly took off. He 
          called the police who investigated and learned that other people in the area were 
          also seeing UFOs and humanoids. In fact, these events took place during a huge wave 
          across the entire country which caused concern at the highest levels of government.</p>

          <p><b>I CAN STILL FEAL THE FEAR</b>. One <b>afternoon in June of 1963</b>, an anonymous 
          woman and her 7-year-old son were vacationing on the small island of Storholmen in 
          Sweden. As they stood by the shore, a strange feeling overcame her, and looking out, 
          she saw a silver craft approach. Inside and on top of it, she saw two perfect-looking 
          muscular men dressed in tight jumpsuits. The craft approached so close that she and her 
          son hid in fear. Then it sped away so fast it disappeared from view in seconds.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN STREET SWEEPER</b>. On the <b>evening of November 18, 1973</b>, four ladies 
          were driving outside Montreal, Canada, when a UFO began to pace their car. After several 
          miles of being followed, they drove through a weird “pink cloud.” Moments later, they 
          saw a short humanoid figure standing in the middle of the road. Unknown to them, many 
          people in the area were seeing UFOs on the same night.</p>

          <p><b>“DON’T YOU WANT TO COME ONBOARD?”</b> It was a <b>Summer morning in 1974</b> as 
          “Mrs. N.” took a walk near her home in Oslo, Norway. Suddenly beautiful music began to 
          play, a glowing craft approached and began to follow her. Inside she saw three figures 
          in dark jumpsuits. One of them stood up, smiled, and gestured to her. She had the 
          impression it was inviting her to come onboard. Filled with fear, Mrs. N ran, and the 
          craft followed.</p>

          <p><b>LANDING AT A FRENCH FARM</b>. At <b>6:30 pm on December 9, 1977</b>, Chanta L of 
          Fonforet, France was amazed to see a glowing craft land outside her farmhouse. Moments 
          later, a 7-foot-tall being floated out of the craft and explored around before returning 
          inside it. Later the craft took off and landed again, leaving strange traces on the 
          ground. At this time, many people in the area were reporting UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>I HEARD A PIERCING SCREAM</b>. One <b>night in March 1978</b>, rancher Monte 
          Brinsmead saw a classic flying saucer with colored lights outside his farm near Lake 
          Sorell, Tasmania. He grabbed his rifle to shoot at it when it took off. He learned 
          that many of his neighbors had been seeing UFOs. Soon numerous events of high 
          strangeness occurred, including an encounter with an apparent humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN AT THE BEACH</b>. At <b>9am on February 3, 1994</b>, six witnesses at 
          the beach in Ancona, Passetto, Italy saw a weird humanoid figure wandering among the 
          rock formation known as “Pope’s Chair” along the beach. Suddenly it flew up into the 
          air and off into the distance.</p>

          <p>These ten cases show that a UFO and humanoid encounter can happen to anyone, 
          anywhere, anytime. While there are those who remain skeptical, there are too many 
          cases to deny, dismiss or debunk. The accounts speak for themselves. We are being 
          visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <h5>Jul 26, 2024 (1:20:54)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Ask and ye shall receive! I recently put out a challenge 
          on my YouTube channel, name any location on Earth, such as your hometown, and I bet 
          I can find a UFO encounter that occurred there! I received more than 150 responses. 
          Challenge accepted! And guess what? I was right! So far, I have been successful in 
          locating UFO cases in every location provided. UFOs are seen everywhere. Pick a 
          location and the chances are it has a long history of UFO encounters.</p>
          
          <p>This video is Episode Two of an ongoing series I call “UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN.” For 
          this episode, by special request from you, the viewers, I cover the locations: Locust 
          Grove, Oklahoma; McMinnville, Oregon; India (yes, the country!); Berkshire Mountains, 
          Massachusetts; Sacramento, California and Nova Scotia, Canada. The encounters in these 
          locations include sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard encounters. The evidence 
          supporting these cases includes multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs, radar-
          returns, landing traces, animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic 
          disturbances and more. Have UFOs visited your hometown? Likely, the answer is yes!</p>
          
          <p><b>LOCUST GROVE, OKLAHOMA</b>. This is a very small rural town with a population of 
          less than 1400 people, and yet, there is a UFO case involving multiple sightings of 
          strange orbs along with strange animal reactions.</p>
          
          <p><b>MCMINNVILLE, OREGON</b>. On <b>May 11, 1950</b>, the town of McMinnville earned 
          international headlines when Paul and Evelyn Trent captured two photographs of a metallic 
          saucer hovering over their farmhouse. Today, the photos are considered among the best on 
          record. But McMinnville has many other cases. In <b>1957,</b> the Kelchner family viewed 
          a glowing egg-shaped object over their poultry farm for 30 minutes. In <b>1976</b>, a man 
          called the National UFO reporting Service (NUFORC) to report his sighting of a UFO being 
          chased by jet fighters. In <b>1991</b>, Susan Wold called the newspapers about her 
          sighting of a solid object in view for 45 minutes. There are more incredible sightings, 
          including a report of a strange humanoid seen by campers at an isolated McMinnville Ranch.</p>
          
          <p><b>INDIA</b>. With a population well in excess of one billion people, India has 
          countless UFO cases. For this reason, only humanoid cases are presented. In <b>March 
          of 1931</b>, a 14-year-old boy from the Andhra Pradesh area of India says he met a wise 
          old Sage who took him onboard a craft where he was given predictions of future disasters. 
          Other cases include a <b>1954</b> landing with humanoids near a beryllium mine; a <b>1976</b> 
          encounter between a woman and an eight-foot-tall humanoid; a family’s multiple encounters 
          with a UFO and entities with the appearance of Hindu Gods, and more. In <b>1985</b>, a 
          girl from Bihar was taken onboard and examined by ETs. In <b>2001</b>, a group of boys 
          from Ahmedabad reported their encounter with two short pale beings. One amazing account 
          includes a UFO and humanoid encounter by a group of scientists in the Indian Himalayas, 
          involving an actual photograph of the humanoid. And many other cases.
          
          <p><b>BERKSHIRE MOUNTAINS, MASSACHUSETTS</b>. This area in the western part of the state 
          contains many cities, so in this episode I cover a few famous accounts, including the 
          alleged onboard experience of talk show host, Morton Downey Jr. Another very famous case 
          is that of Thom Reed, who in <b>1967</b> along with his family, had a very close encounter. 
          Other sightings occurred in <b>1973, 1978</b> and more.</p>
          
          <p><b>SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA</b>. This city contains more than a half million residents, 
          and has a long and rich history of sightings, landings, and humanoids. The earliest 
          occurred in <b>1896</b> with the famous airship wave. Classic saucer sightings were made 
          in <b>1947, 1950, 1952, 1955, 1957</b> and more. One of the strangest UFO cases on record 
          occurred to a paperboy on <b>July 11, 1961</b> that must be heard to be believed. A truly 
          astonishing case involves a witness who saw a landed UFO and humanoids near McClellan AFB. 
          Encounters continue, with some as recent as <b>2018</b>.</p>
          
          <p><b>NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA</b>. This area contains many towns and cities and a huge 
          variety of encounters. In <b>1952</b>, the crew of the Marcala reported their close encounter 
          with a silvery UFO. In <b>1952</b>, a trained weather observer had an amazing encounter 
          with a disc. An amazing humanoid encounter occurred in <b>1953</b>. A harrowing USO 
          encounter occurred in <b>May 1963</b>. Nova Scotia’s most famous case by far is the 
          Shag Harbor incident of <b>October 4, 1967</b>. More landings, USOs, pilot encounters 
          and more, including an incredible encounter of a UFO over a graveyard.</p>
          
          <p>Six specific locations – all with a history of UFO encounters. As should be obvious 
          by now, UFOs are seen everywhere: sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard experiences 
          and more. Pretty much every location on this planet has a long history of encounters. 
          Those who don’t think UFOs are real have not done their research. It’s that simple. The 
          evidence is undeniable. We are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Jul 19, 2024 (1:13:45)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">When it comes to extraterrestrials, the humanoid form seems 
          to be the universal template. The vast majority of reports involve some kind of bipedal 
          humanoid. And there are sooo many! These accounts come from across the planet, and have 
          been occurring for a very long time. The cases have astounding similarities that point 
          towards the veracity of these accounts, and they are also supported by a wide variety of 
          evidence. This video presents ten cases of face-to-face encounters with humanoids. There 
          are too many cases to ignore, deny or explain away. The evidence speaks for itself. There 
          is life beyond Earth.</p>

          <p><b>ET CONTACTS DEAF-MUTE MAN</b>. One <b>evening in 1950</b>, 13-year-old William Ortiz 
          (who was deaf) saw a gray-type ET outside his home in Floridablanca, Colombia. Moments 
          later, he saw a landed craft and several other figures. The ET closest to him then 
          communicated telepathically and used sign-language. Afterwards, William’s hearing was 
          temporarily restored. It was to be the first of three amazing encounters.

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MAN OF NORBOTTEN</b>. From <b>1970-1972</b>, people over a wide area near 
          Norbotten, Sweden encountered a strange little man that did not appear to be human. The 
          little figure was often seen along highways late at night, and was usually accompanied by 
          blinding lights and mysterious sounds. Some witnesses reported strange medical effects 
          after their encounters.

          <p><b>ALIENS AT A RADIO STATION</b>. In the <b>Spring of 1975</b>, a nightwatchman at 
          the Maribor Radio station in Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) received a series of strange 
          phone-calls at the station. Two months later, he was at work when TV malfunctioned. 
          Then, in walked four tall humanoid figures. One approached the witness (now unable to 
          move) and pressed his thumb against his neck. The high strangeness had just begun.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN OR ESCAPED CIRCUS DWARF?</b> At <b>4pm on May 14, 1976</b>, two men were 
          shocked to see a short humanoid in the wilderness at Monte Parodi, Italy. It wore a 
          strange jumpsuit and floated above the ground. Four months later, on <b>September 17, 
          1976</b>, 15 witnesses saw another short humanoid in the same area. This time, there 
          were landing traces, radiation readings, and one of the witnesses photographed the ET.</p>

          <p><b>A PURPLE-HAIRED ALIEN</b>. On the <b>morning of March 13, 1978</b>, Claudio 
          Franco (age 10) was at school in Vilar Formosa, Portugal. During class, he went alone 
          to the restroom and as he exited, he was pushed down. Then he saw a shocking sight: a 
          humanoid figure with purple hair, a wrinkled and scarred face, wearing a skintight 
          white jumpsuit stared down at him. After 10 minutes, the figure disappeared. Claudio 
          found burn-marks on his back.</p>

          <p><b>WE LOVE YOU</b>. On the <b>evening of October 14, 1978</b>, Peggy Otis and her 
          young granddaughter Jenny were driving to their home in Bear Valley, Colorado when a 
          UFO appeared over their car. Peggy recalls exiting the car, screaming, and seeing what 
          she thought were angels. Later, she sought hypnosis, and recalled having a telepathic 
          conversation with gray aliens who had important messages to share with her.</p>

          <p><b>MY WORLD WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE THE SAME</b>. One <b>evening in August of 1979</b>, 
          Mrs. H.M. Dickinson was in her home overlooking Patten Bay in Surry, Maine when she and 
          a friend saw a small bulb-shaped, transparent craft with a bald-headed creature inside 
          floating a few feet away. The creature turned its head and stared at her as it floated 
          off. A few days later, the being returned!</p>

          <p><b>I NEVER BELIEVED IN ALIENS</b>. Around <b>dusk one evening in February 1981</b>, 
          an anonymous farmer from Westfield, North Carolina went to look for his dog who had run 
          off. He found his dog attacking a small, thin, hairless humanoid with large dark eyes. 
          The humanoid's legs were mangled by his dog. The farmer ran off in fear. When he returned 
          the next day, the humanoid was gone, and his dog was dead.</p>

          <p><b>WE COME FROM VERY FAR AWAY</b>. On the <b>night of February 6, 1991</b>, Sylvia and 
          two friends observed a UFO near Sylvia’s home in Chaville, France. Returning home, Sylvia 
          was struck by a beam of light from the object. That night, strange humanoids visited her 
          in her bedroom. The next morning, she received a telepathic message from the ETs and had 
          a face-to-face encounter with an apparent gray alien.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS FOLLOWED THEM HOME</b>. On the <b>afternoon of December 19, 2015</b>, two 
          brothers (Miguel and Patricio) were hiking in the forests near their home in Auracania, 
          Chile when two tall humanoids wearing white jumpsuits confronted them. The boys ran home 
          and the humanoids chased them. Arriving home, they locked the doors. Their mother also saw 
          the two humanoids, which remained outside for the next two hours.</p>

          <p>These ten cases contain many important insights into the nature of UFO contact. They 
          show how similar ETs can be. They show how contact can be very frightening. They show how 
          truly advanced extraterrestrials are. Most importantly, these cases provide compelling 
          evidence for the reality of visitors from beyond Earth.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different kinds of UFO encounters, but the 
          ultimate experience is being taken onboard a craft and meeting ETs face-to-face. And 
          it happens more often than you might think. In 1991, the Roper Poll Survey found that 
          as many as 1 in 50 people may be UFO contactees, which means that millions of people 
          are having this kind of encounter! This episode presents just a small sample of six 
          cases from around the world. These cases involve both single and multiple witnesses 
          and contain some very compelling evidence such as physiological effects, healings, 
          implants and more. Even more importantly, they answer some of the many questions 
          surrounding this subject.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF BETTY STEWART DAGENAIS</b>. In <b>1925</b>, when Betty Stewart Dagenais 
          of Ontario Canada was only five years old, she was taken onboard a craft and examined by 
          gray ETs. A few months later it happened again. As an adult she had three more encounters. 
          These were primarily recalled under hypnosis, and all she could remember was being physically 
          examined and apparently given an alien implant. This turned out to be true, because later her 
          implant was surgically removed by doctors here on Earth, and it turned out to have some amazing 
          properties that defy conventional explanations.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF SHARON KEEFE</b>. Sharon’s first UFO sighting occurred when she was only 11 
          or 12 years old. Years later as an adult living in Gallup, NM, she started having missing time. 
          In <b>1975-76</b>, while driving with her daughters along the highway at night, she was followed 
          by a UFO and experienced another episode of missing time. She decided to seek hypnosis, and 
          recalled that she and her daughters were taken onboard a craft and examined by tall gray beings. 
          They told her that they were there to test her endurance and give her gifts. She felt love and 
          compassion for the beings and felt that her experience was benevolent.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF HERMINIO & BIANCA REIS</b>. On the <b>evening of January 12, 1976</b>, while 
          driving along a remote highway near Paraibuna, Brazil, Bianca Reis saw a glowing orange object 
          in the sky. She alerted her husband, Herminio, and the next thing they knew, it sent down a 
          beam of light onto their car and sucked them both (with their car) into the craft. Inside they 
          met tall human-looking beings who spoke telepathically with them, engaging them in a long 
          conversation about deep, philosophical subjects. They gave them information about how to 
          teach people to advance their own psychic abilities and learn astral projection. Soon more 
          contacts occurred and even more people became involved and even healed!</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF GHULAM REZA BAZARANI</b>. It was <b>April 2, 1976</b>, the day of 
          “Sizdeh-Bedar,” an Iranian holiday when Gholam Reza Bazargani (age 19) went walking in 
          the forests near his home in Chalus, Iran. Gholam was from a wealthy family, and when he 
          went missing, police organized a massive search. Two days later, Gholam was found 
          hundreds of miles to the south in the city of Isfahan. He had an amazing story to tell. 
          He said that a silver flying saucer appeared overhead and he suddenly found himself 
          inside it being examined by non-human entities. He recalled being examined by 
          instruments with colored lights, and then lost consciousness. When he awoke, his watch 
          was missing. On the day of his return, many people in the area saw flying saucers.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF MIGUEL HERRERO SIERRA</b>. Early on the <b>morning of December 18, 
          1977</b>, Miguel Herrero Sierra (a 37-year-old driver/entrepreneur) left his home in 
          Alcala, Spain to go fishing at the Buendia Reservoir. He never made it. Half-way there, 
          his car engine mysteriously failed. Then he saw a landed flying saucer in the field next 
          to him. Two human-looking figures dressed in white jumpsuits approached and pulled him 
          onboard. The ETs told him that they were contacting many people on Earth and told him 
          many other things before returning him back to his car. While Miguel remembered at least 
          15 minutes of being onboard, the entire experience lasted three hours. Later, under 
          hypnosis, he recalled more incredible details.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF HELEN</b>. On <b>January 24, 1992</b>, “Helen,” (age 50) was with her 
          husband in their home in Mezobereny, Hungary. Suddenly a strange apparition of a woman 
          appeared in her kitchen. Later that night, Helen felt compelled to go into her backyard 
          where she saw a landed flying saucer. She went onboard where she saw many other women 
          and young children. Over the next few nights, she had the same experience. Then she woke 
          up in her bed to find several strange dark marks on her abdomen. Doctors were unable to 
          diagnose or explain them. Then, to Helen’s surprise, she found herself cured of two 
          chronic medical conditions!</p>

          <p>These six cases are just a tiny portion of the actual number of cases of this kind, 
          and yet they provide a representative sample of what it’s like to have the ultimate UFO 
          encounter, an onboard experience and face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials.</p>

          ABDUCT MY DOG: THE<br>
          JOHN TRASCO STORY</a></h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Jul 7, 2024 (1:17:19)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Around <b>6:00 p.m., on November 6, 1957</b>, John Trasco 
          and his wife Ellen were in their home in Everittstown, New Jersey. John had just 
          returned from his job at the local paper mill. He stepped out to feed their dog, King, 
          a six-year-old, charcoal-colored, half-blind, bad-tempered, Belgian police dog, who 
          they kept tied to the side of the house.</p>

          <p>Shortly after John stepped outside, Mrs. Trasco heard King barking furiously. She 
          looked outside and saw a strange reflection in the yard. Staring at it, she was amazed 
          to see it was a glowing egg-shaped object, about nine to twelve feet long, hovering, 
          and bobbing up and down. Meanwhile, John also saw the craft, and approaching him from 
          the direction of the craft was a strange humanoid figure.</p>

          <p>“I looked and I seen a little man,” John says. “…He came down towards me and he said, 
          ‘Don’t be afraid. I don’t mean any harm.’ So, I got a little closer to him and started 
          talking to him about the dog. And he said, ‘Don’t be afraid. We’re friendly people, we 
          don’t mean any harm.’ I started shaking. I was scared. He came up to me and said, ‘Would 
          you like to give us your dog, we’d like to have it.”</p>

          <p>The man spoke very slowly in English, with what sounded like a German accent in a 
          sharp, squeaky voice. “We just want your dog,” he said.</p>

          <p>So began one of the strangest UFO encounters in history. In this episode, you can 
          hear the firsthand audiotape interview with John and Ellen as they describe their 
          unique and bizarre encounter with a short humanoid who tried to abduct their dog. This 
          episode is a sequel or addendum to the episode, “ALIENS ABDUCTED BY DOG," which features 
          more than two dozen cases of this kind. You can learn more about them in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">We all love our fur babies, and dogs are the most popular pet 
          of all. They have been man’s best friend for countless millennia. What many people don’t 
          know, however, is that ETs also show a great interest in canines. There has never been a 
          study of dog-UFO cases until now! This video presents more than two dozen cases in which 
          dogs have been directly and extensively involved with UFOs and extraterrestrials. These 
          cases reach back to the 1940s up to the present day, and they provide some profound 
          insights into extraterrestrials and their agenda on this planet.</p>
          
          <p>These cases come from across the planet, New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Ukraine, 
          England, Wales, Ireland, Spain, Canada, Mexico, and more, including all over the United 
          States. A wide variety of ETs show interest in a wide variety of dogs. The cases include 
          dogs being taken onboard and examined, and even in some cases healed. In some cases, the 
          dogs are taken by themselves. In others, people are taken onboard with their own dogs.</p>
          
          <p>Why are ETs taking dogs onboard? What do these accounts have to tell us about 
          extraterrestrials? The answers are in this unique episode. These cases offer a wide 
          variety of compelling evidence including multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs 
          of UFOs, audio recordings from firsthand witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, 
          electromagnetic disturbances, and of course, animal reaction cases!</p>
          
          <p>With so many encounters like these, the truth cannot be denied. ETs are showing an 
          interest in dogs. If you would like to explore more about cases like these, check out

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are seen all over our planet. It appears that virtually 
          every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. But is this true? 
          Recently a put out a challenge: name a location that you would like to know if UFOs have 
          visited such as your hometown. The response was huge: many people asked if I could find 
          any UFO cases in their hometown.</p>
          
          <p>So, by special request, this episode presents ten locations from across the United States 
          (and a few outside of it,) and the history of UFO encounters that have occurred there. This 
          includes sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids and of course, onboard 
          encounters. Compelling evidence supports many of these cases including multiple eyewitness 
          testimonies, photographs, radar-returns, landing traces, physiological effects, animal 
          reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more.</p>

          <p><b>WENATCHEE, WASHINGTON</b>. This history of UFOs in Wenatchee reaches back to at 
          least <b>1907</b> when a strange airship was seen by multiple citizens. Following this, 
          many other encounters occurred, including star-like objects, multi-colored UFOs, cone-
          shaped objects, shiny silver triangular-shaped objects, craft turning at right angles, 
          and even a large object directly over downtown Wenatchee.</p>

          <p><b>SIOUX FALLS, SD</b>. One of the earlier Sioux Falls cases involved the sighting 
          of a classic flying saucer moving overhead in <b>July 1947</b>. In <b>1954</b>, police 
          officers in Sioux Falls and surrounding areas saw UFOs. In <b>1957</b>, police officer 
          Jack Peters photographed a UFO as people all over the area witnessed strange activity. 
          In <b>1976</b>, UFOs were seen landing in Sioux Falls, and some reported seeing an 
          actual ET. Even as late as <b>2018</b>, UFOs continued to appear.</p>

          <p><b>PAYSON, AZ</b>. In <b>July of 1969</b>, a ranch family had a dramatic sighting 
          of a classic flying saucer outside their ranch home. <b>1981</b>, Sheriff Deputy Loyce 
          Hamlin and 4 other officers reported UFOs. Hamlin had seen one before following a plane 
          taking off from Payson. In the <b>late 1980s</b>, a Payson resident reported missing 
          time while returning to his home. The sightings continued!</p>

          <p><b>ALBANY, GA</b>. In <b>1948</b>, a pilot’s sighting over Albany was declared 
          unidentified by Project Blue Book. More pilot sightings occurred in <b>1953</b> and 
          in <b>1956</b>. In <b>1968</b>, Conway Jones reported a frightening encounter where 
          a UFO disabled his car. In <b>1973</b>, a flurry of encounters over Albany generated 
          national headlines.</p>

          <p><b>AALBORG, DENMARK</b>. In <b>1963</b>, a flying saucer landed next to a farmhouse 
          in Aalborg. A human-looking ET came out and took the farmer onboard, right in front of 
          his amazed wife. In <b>2006, 2009</b>, and <b>2011</b>, three more close encounters were 
          reported, showing that Aalborg has been repeatedly visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p><b>VISALIA/TULARE, CA</b>. In <b>November of 1989</b>, hundreds of residents in the 
          area witnessed the now famous unexplained airships. Following this, encounters occurred 
          regularly, including in <b>1952, 1979</b>, and <b>2010</b>. On <b>January 1, 2022</b>, 
          a family had a close-up sighting of a UFO and captured three photos of the object 
          hovering near their home.</p>

          <p><b>PHILIPPINES</b>. On <b>March 8, 1968</b>, more than 100 passengers on a jet over 
          the Bashi Channel were amazed to see a UFO pacing their plane. A few months later, a 
          mini-wave of sightings were observed by hundreds of people in the city of Manila. In 
          <b>November of 1968</b>, four separate groups of witnesses observed a strange object 
          with two human-looking figures inside. In <b>1979</b>, a UFO was seen by many landing 
          near Mount Apo. In <b>1991</b>, a resident saw a UFO land near her home. ETs came out 
          and started picking flowers.</p>

          <p><b>ST LOUIS, MO</b>. This city has many cases. A chiropractor reports his lifelong 
          experiences with friendly ETs. In <b>1966</b>, a UFO was seen landing at Point Pleasant 
          Elementary school, and several students and one teacher saw an ET. Another case involves 
          a dramatic sighting over a drive-in theater. And there are two other cases, one involving 
          a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid, and another involving a landing.</p>

          <p><b>OCALA, FL</b>. Sightings here reach back to <b>1947</b> and occur regularly, 
          including in <b>1952, 1955, 1957, 1968, 1974</b> and more. On <b>May 14, 1978</b>, 
          a wave of sightings over Ocala was witnessed by dozens and was also seen and caught 
          on radar at the Navy’s Pinecastle Electronic Warfare Range. The wave went on for months 
          and generated national headlines and huge controversy. In <b>April 2003</b>, a woman 
          reported a humanoid in her home which healed her of a problem pregnancy. The sightings 
          continued.</p>

          <p><b>WILMINGTON, NC</b>. On <b>April 6, 1897</b>, hundreds in Wilmington saw the 
          famous unexplained airships. More sightings of UFOs occurred in <b>1977</b> and <b>1980</b>. 
          In <b>1986</b>, a couple had a scary encounter with a giant V-shaped craft. In <b>2001</b>, 
          a gentleman reported his terrifying encounter with humanoids in his Wilmington home.</p>

          <p>These are just a small sample of the actual number of the documented cases coming 
          from these ten locations. And these are just the ones which have been recorded. The 
          fact is, most people don’t report their encounters. Have UFOs visited your hometown?</p>

          <h5>Jun 21, 2024 (1:08:48)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The time for skepticism is over. There are too many cases 
          to ignore, too much evidence to deny. This video presents ten true cases of firsthand 
          extraterrestrial encounters from across the globe, each providing important information 
          and profound insights into the UFO phenomenon. Many have multiple witnesses and 
          compelling evidence in the form of landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, 
          animal reactions and physiological effects. It’s time for all humanity to accept 
          the truth of the ET presence on Earth.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO GOBLINS</b>. On the <b>morning of March 15, 1943</b>, sisters “C,” (10) 
          and Angela (6) were grazing the family goat by their home in the small town of 
          Montecreste, Italy. Suddenly a “great roar” overhead caught their attention and they 
          saw a saucer-shaped craft land nearby. Two figures in white jumpsuits exited and 
          talked in a weird language. Knowing nothing of UFOs and ETs, the girls thought they 
          saw goblins.</p>

          <p><b>FOUR ALIENS IN THE BACKYARD</b>. At <b>2am on October 13, 1975</b>, Mayme H awoke 
          to her dog barking. Looking outside her home in Alton, Illinois, she saw a 3½-foot-tall 
          humanoid in a silver jumpsuit in her backyard. Moments later, it was joined by three 
          others, and all four ran single-file into the forest behind her home. The next morning, 
          they found a circle of crushed grass in a field not far from the location.</p>

          <p><b>HIGHWAY HUMANOID</b>. At <b>9:45 pm, January 26, 1976</b>, Claude Cretin was 
          driving between Madilly-Mandelot and Bouze-les-Beaune in France when a flash of light 
          blinded him. A short distance ahead, he saw a tall humanoid in a fluorescent red 
          bodysuit and helmet with a face-mask standing by the road. He drove off in fear and 
          went to the police. Returning to the site the next morning, they found broken branches 
          10-15 feet high.</p>

          <p><b>THE MEN FROM THE STAR</b>. Just past <b>midnight on January 28, 1976</b>, Miguel 
          Fernandez Carrasco was walking to his home in Benacazon, Spain when a star-like object 
          approached. Suddenly it landed next to him. It was a strange craft. Two 7-foot-tall 
          humanoids exited and approached. Miguel ran in fear. The humanoids went back into the 
          craft and then followed him from above, sending down a beam of light, causing Miguel 
          to pass out. He awoke two hours later in front of his home, with strange marks on his 
          body.</p>

          <p><b>ANOTHER FLYING HUMANOID</b>. At <b>5:00 am on April 7, 1977</b>, former politician 
          Cyril John saw light flood his home in Milford Haven, Wales. Looking out the window, he 
          saw an oval-shaped craft hovering 200 feet away. Then he saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid 
          wearing a silver-gray suit, hovering just 35 feet away. He watched both object and 
          humanoid for the next half-hour until they slowly moved off into the distance.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN MEETING</b>. On the <b>afternoon of Sep 27, 1978</b>, Henryk Marciniak 
          took his motorcycle to a wooded area outside Kanin, Poland to pick edible mushrooms. 
          Suddenly he saw a metallic craft landed in a clearing. Two short humanoids in black 
          jumpsuits exited and approached him. They had greenish-skin, webbed hands, and large 
          bulging eyes. They showed interest in both his motorcycle and the mushrooms, then took 
          off in their craft.</p>

          <p><b>RIGHT OVER THE CAR</b>. At <b>5:30 pm on Nov 13, 1982</b>, two men driving to 
          Port Wakefield in South Australia saw an object pacing their car. Suddenly it was 
          right overhead and looking up, they saw right into the front of the craft. They could 
          see several humanoids inside and all kinds of weird equipment. Frightened, they 
          panicked and drove off. Soon other people in the area began to report UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>100 LITTLE ALIENS</b>. At <b>5:45 pm on October 28, 1985</b>, a dozen children 
          were playing outside their homes in Honefoss, Norway when a UFO appeared overhead and 
          seemed to land. As it disappeared, they suddenly saw a huge crowd of tiny humanoids 
          running around. They were dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. For the next two hours, 
          they ran around the area, causing some children to flee in panic. Later strange 
          footprints were found.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN THE BUSHES</b>. One <b>afternoon in Oct 1986</b>, farmer Alberto 
          Meyer was shocked to see two 5-foot-tall humanoids emerge from the brush near his home 
          in Viale, Entre Rios, Argentina. They had huge hairless heads, small facial features, 
          and wore skintight jumpsuits. One seemed to smile at Alberto as they returned to the 
          brush. Later, a footprint was found and photographed. More UFOs were soon seen.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOIDS ABOVE A CITY STREET</b>. At <b>9pm on Jan 19, 1991</b>, Helge F walked 
          along Markt Street in Ronneburg, Germany when a powerful wind struck her. Looking up, 
          she saw a craft 100 feet overhead. It tilted toward her, revealing three strange 
          humanoids inside. Helge found herself waving at them. One pointed a strange rod at 
          her. The craft moved off. Helge found she was missing about 15 minutes of time.</p>

          <p>These ten cases are a tiny portion of the actual number of cases, each of which 
          provide further evidence that we are not alone, that ETs are visiting our planet. 
          The truth can no longer be denied. They are here.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While governments across the world now admit to the validity 
          UFOs, they still refuse to discuss firsthand contact cases. The heart of the UFO 
          phenomenon is not the craft, but the UFO occupants themselves. The evidence shows 
          clearly that UFOs are craft, piloted by living beings. The thousands of humanoid 
          cases can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. This video presents ten 
          cases of very close encounters with humanoids of all kinds. They span more than 100 
          years, come from across the world, and many contain compelling evidence to support 
          them.</p>

          <p><b>THE SMILING EXTRATERRESTRIAL</b>. One <b>morning in the Summer of 1915</b>, 
          Bjarne Westvand (age 6) was playing outside his home in Jakobsbakken, Norway when a 
          craft landed, and out stepped two three-foot-tall figures with large heads, long 
          hair, gray skin. One walked right up to him then turned around and departed. It was 
          an experience he kept secret for 65 years.</p>

          <p><b>QUARRY ALIEN</b>. At <b>2:05 pm on May 30, 1971</b>, Pierrette Debofle stepped 
          outside her home in Dannes, France to collect some grass for her rabbits. Looking up, 
          she saw a strange craft in the chalk quarry behind her house. Then she saw a three-
          foot-tall figure with a large glowing head and a bulky torso, walking and floating 
          near the craft. Suddenly it went inside it and the craft took off at high speed.</p>

          <p><b>THE GITCHIE-MANITOU UFO WAVE</b>. One <b>night in mid-April 1976</b>, Linda 
          Sehr of Lyon, Iowa saw a UFO near the Gitchie-Manitou State Park. To her shock, it 
          followed her car home. One month later Andy and Joel Rygh (age 8 and 6) were playing 
          the park when they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid. They ran and told their two older 
          brothers, and all four saw a craft dart away. Soon more encounters would occur.</p>

          <p><b>CURED OF ARTHRITIS</b>. At <b>8pm on September 6, 1976</b>, Leoncio and Elena 
          Torres were driving through a rural area of Carabaya, Peru when a UFO landed on the 
          road in front of them. Two human-looking figures came out, approached them, and 
          touched them both on the back. They felt burning heat and the figures left. 
          Afterward there were landing traces on the road, and both Leoncio and Elena were 
          cured of their arthritis.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MAN OF DUNN, NORTH CAROLINA</b>. On <b>October 12, 1976</b>, eight-
          year-old Tonnlie Barefoot was playing outside his home in Dunn, NC when he saw a 
          little one-foot-tall man staring at him. The tiny man ran away. Tonnlie told his 
          mother and others, but nobody believed him. Then they found the footprints. Two 
          weeks later, Shirley Ann McCrimmon was entering her home only a few miles away 
          when she also saw a little man. But was this an ET or something else?</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN COUPLE</b>. On the <b>night of August 30, 1977</b>, Ceferina Vargas 
          Martin was walking home in Escalada, Spain when a powerful light hit her face. 
          Seconds later, she saw a very odd-looking man and woman with large eyes, two slits 
          for a nose, a thin mouth and yellowish skin. Both wore strange clothes. A powerful 
          weakness swept over her and she fainted. Upon awakening, the couple was gone, and 
          so were some of Ceferina’s belongings.</p>

          <p><b>A VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTER</b>. On <b>November 1, 1980</b>, sisters Kristina Rydhold 
          and Nina Grundin were driving to their parents’ home near Hovsta, Sweden when a UFO 
          began to circle overhead. Without warning it approached to within 50 feet, close enough 
          that they could both see two humanoids inside it. Their car stalled and began to shake 
          mysteriously. Finally the craft left, but this was only one of several close encounters 
          in the area at that time.</p>

          <p><b>PICNIC WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL</b>. On the <b>afternoon of April 26, 1984</b>, a 
          few hundred teachers and students went for an outside picnic at rural Monte Sant’Antonio 
          near Macomer, Italy. A teacher and student went exploring and both saw a strange short 
          humanoid. They were unable to move until it left. Moments later, a craft rose from the 
          ground, leaving landing traces. Soon, another student saw the strange humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>MISSING TIME IN MIRABEL</b>. Around <b>4am one morning in August 2012</b>, a man 
          and woman traveled by motorcycle outside of Mirabel, Canada. Suddenly a UFO appeared 
          overhead. It sent down a beam of light, striking them. The man saw strange humanoids 
          looking down at him. Afterwards, they drove off and forgot everything. Months later, 
          the man suddenly remembered the encounter. The woman, however, had no memory of any 
          humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE RECTANGLE</b>. On the <b>night of September 8, 2012</b>, Konnonova 
          Irina Dmitrievna was outside her home in Penza, Ternovka, Russia when she noticed a 
          glowing rectangle of red light in the sky. As it approached, the light changed shape and 
          she could see a humanoid inside, facing her. It soon moved off. But a short time later 
          and a few miles away, another woman saw a very similar object.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, each offering a glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face 
          encounter with strange humanoids, each providing another piece of the puzzle to solving 
          the UFO mystery. The evidence speaks for itself: we are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid 
          – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s happening 
          to a lot of people. It’s been happening all over the world for a very long time. While 
          governments across the world are admitting that UFOs are real, they refuse to talk about 
          firsthand contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent 
          the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? This video 
          presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids. These include multiple 
          witness cases with a wide variety of supporting evidence. Time for truth!</p>

          <p><b>A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE</b>. It was <b>10am one summer morning in 1948</b> when Ernst-
          August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep 
          scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched 
          it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange 
          humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>A VERY LOUD UFO</b>. One <b>afternoon in July of 1960</b>, railway worker Georges 
          Godbout and two others were on the Canadian National Railroad by Chapais, Quebec, Canada 
          when a UFO appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit 
          came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, quickly fled. The UFO 
          flew off with a noise so loud, it made the witnesses physically ill.</p>

          <p><b>SPRAYED BY A UFO</b>. On the <b>afternoon of September 30, 1971</b>, Anssi Hakala 
          (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland when a tall green humanoid 
          appeared, floating above his head. Anssi biked away in fear. The being disappeared into 
          a craft, which continued to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a weird liquid as 
          Anssi raced home.</p>

          <p><b>THE LAUGHING ALIENS</b>. At <b>5:30 pm on September 27, 1973</b>, Antoine X (a 
          mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms by his home in Bedarrides, France when he saw 
          what appeared to be two small children. But they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine 
          features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared 
          into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.</p>

          <p><b>UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP</b>. At <b>9:30 pm on February 3, 1977</b>, several children from 
          a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer 
          hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through 
          one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking 
          down at them.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF</b>. At </b>6:30 pm</b>, Frank Sverre Mandte and 
          Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, 
          Norway, when they noticed a glowing object approach. In moments, it came overhead, 
          stopped, and landed a short distance away. Both boys saw a humanoid looking out at them. 
          The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE</b>. Just before <b>10pm on August 31, 1978</b>, just as a 
          power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias 
          observed an oval craft with porthole hovering near their farm. It then ejected two figures 
          with glowing red eyes who approached the farm and began to inspect the sheds. They stayed 
          for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area.</p>

          <p><b>CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS</b>. At <b>7:40 pm on September 21, 1978</b>, an 
          anonymous boy was walking near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the environment around 
          him lit up like daylight, and a UFO appeared on a nearby hill. Suddenly he saw four 
          humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by four 
          humanoids. He fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN IN THE YARD</b>. At <b>10pm on November 24, 1988</b>, Rune Asplund was in 
          his home in Daviken, Sweden when he noticed an odd-looking figure in his yard. The 
          figure stood in a strange posture, and was wearing a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going 
          outside to investigate, the figure disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police 
          officer had an encounter the same night, and his neighbor also saw a strange humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY</b>. It was <b>1:30am one evening in the summer of 1999</b> 
          when a 14-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching sound coming from outside the second-story 
          bedroom window of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange 
          3-foot-tall creature with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother 
          also heard the scream, rushed in, and saw it too. The creature remained for 15 minutes before 
          finally leaving. But it would soon return.</p>

          <p>These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. 
          And these ten accounts represent just a tiny portion of the true number of encounters. So 
          many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. 
          We are being visited.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">With nearly a million reported and documented UFO encounters, 
          it is clear that we are not alone in this universe. ETs are visiting our planet, and 
          people all over the world are encountering humanoids of many different kinds. This video 
          presents ten super-strange cases of humanoid encounters, many with multiple witnesses and 
          compelling evidence. Face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials provide important 
          insights into the UFO phenomenon and answer many of the questions surrounding this subject.</p>

          <p><b>POLICE OFFICERS SEE LANDED UFO AND HUMANOIDS</b>. At <b>1am one evening in January 
          1956</b>, French gendarmes (Henri Barboule and Msr Simon) were in Barre-des-Cevennes, 
          France, when they heard a deafening roar. Looking up, they saw a flying saucer pass overhead 
          and land a short distance away. As the craft released a probe, four humanoids exited the 
          craft. Both officers were paralyzed with fear.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS IN CITY PARK</b>. Around <b>9:30 pm on the night of December 9, 1962</b>, 
          driver/waiter Antonio Candau was walking to his home near Bologna, Italy when he saw a 
          flying saucer land nearby. He watched in awe as two olive-skinned human-looking men 
          wearing yellow jumpsuits exited. The two men approached him, speaking a strange language 
          and gesturing to him. The experience changed Antonio’s life.</p>

          <p><b>FOLLOWED BY A UFO</b>. One <b>night in January 1973</b>, five people were driving 
          near Nowra, NSW, Australia when a UFO appeared and began pacing their car. One of the 
          passengers was shocked to see humanoid figures looking out at him through the portholes. 
          The craft followed their vehicle for many miles, before suddenly darting away. The next 
          morning, one of the witnesses would have another encounter.</p>

          <p><b>THE CLUMSY ROBOT</b>. Early in the <b>morning of July 10, 1976</b>, Miguel Angel 
          Ruiz Samperio, and his friend, Margarita Cagigas were getting ready to car-pool to work 
          when they saw a strange figure walking down the street of their home town of Escalante, 
          Spain. To their shock, it looked robotic and was at least nine feet tall. After walking 
          off, it disappeared. They later learned that other people saw it too.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS AT THE FRONT DOOR</b>. On the <b>night of July 11, 1978</b>, “Amalia,” was 
          in her home in Alta da Mooca, Brazil when she heard a thump and a strange buzzing noise, 
          her dog began to bark, and her TV filled with static. Opening the door, she was confronted 
          by two short humanoids and a landed UFO behind them. She was paralyzed as the figures shone 
          strange lights around and returned to their craft, which took off, leaving Amalia utterly 
          shocked.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS AT SUGAR-CANE FARM</b>. Late at <b>night on April 26, 1979</b>, farmer 
          Mamerto Demetillo was woken up by light filling his home in Talisay, the Philippines. 
          Rushing outside, he saw three flying saucers landing next to his farm. He watched as two 
          human-looking figures exited each craft, and examined the area. After 20 minutes, they 
          returned inside the craft which took off, leaving landing traces. At the time, there was 
          a wave of sightings in the area.</p>

          <p><b>THE MOST REMARKABLE THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME</b>. One <b>night in the fall of 
          1989</b>, shortly after reading some UFO books, an anonymous witness saw a UFO outside 
          her home near the Apalachicola Forest in Florida. Suddenly, a glowing sphere emerged from 
          the craft and entered through her window. An eight-foot-tall figure appeared. The witness 
          fainted and for 2 years, forgot the encounter.</p>

          <p><b>YOU ARE ME</b>. On the <b>night March 9, 1992</b>, two women were driving to their 
          homes in Hamar, Norway when a saucer with two short humanoids hovered in front of their 
          car. They both experienced missing time. Later that night, one of the witnesses, Gry 
          Jannicke Jarlum, was visited at her home. She remained in contact with the ETs who began 
          to teach her volumes of profound information, completely changing her life forever.</p>

          <p><b>A ROADSIDE GRAY</b>. While driving to his home in Cary, Illinois one <b>evening in 
          March 1995</b>, an anonymous man was shocked to see a short strange-looking figure 
          alongside the road. Thinking it was the victim of a car accident, he slowed down, and 
          was amazed to see a short figure with a large bald head, huge dark oval eyes, and pale 
          white skin. It was not human, and the witness drove off in shock.</p>

          <p><b>THE MEN IN THE SKY</b>. On the <b>night of April 26, 2009</b>, a man in his home 
          in Bad Neuenahr, Germany noticed a brilliant light in the sky. He watched it approach, 
          revealing itself to be a multi-colored rectangular craft with numerous portholes. And 
          through the portholes he saw the silhouettes of several figures looking out at him from 
          only 100 feet away. He was convinced it was a genuine UFO, and watched as it flew slowly 
          away.</p>

          <p>Ten super-strange alien encounters from all over the world! And there are so many more. 
          How many cases are needed to prove to the world that we are not alone? Earth is being 
          visited by extraterrestrials of many kinds. The truth can no longer be denied, covered 
          up or explained away. The evidence speaks for itself.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Can you imagine being taken onboard a craft and meeting 
          extraterrestrials face-to-face? It is perhaps the ultimate encounter. This video 
          presents five astonishing cases of people taken onboard an ET craft. While each of 
          these cases does involve a single witness, every one of them was recalled consciously 
          without hypnosis. And every one of them includes compelling evidence pointing to the 
          reality of the encounter. They come from all over the world, and provide a close-up 
          look at what it’s like to meet aliens face-to-face. They also answer many of the 
          questions surrounding ET contact and their agenda on planet Earth.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE CASE OF WARABE AMANAKA</b>. It was a <b>summer evening in 1926</b> when 2-year-
          old Warabe Amanaka heard a telepathic voice calling him outside. Venturing outside his 
          home in Matsuyama, Japan, he was greeted by a tall, blond-haired human-looking figure who 
          promised to meet him again. Over the next three years, the man (who Warabe called Uncle) 
          appeared several times. Then on Aug 2, 1930, Warabe (age 5) heard the familiar telepathic 
          voice and met Uncle again. This time, Warabe was taken onboard a craft, and given a ride 
          around the planet, viewing whales in the ocean, elephants in Africa and the Great Pyramids 
          of Egypt. After being dropped back home, the ETs promised to visit him again. During one 
          of his visits, the ETs gave Warabe a strange metal box. It’s one of Japan’s strangest 
          cases on record.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF NICHOLAS HENRY EDWARDS</b>. In <b>Jul 1952</b>, at age nine, Nicholas 
          Edwards was outside his home near Point Defiance Park in Washington State, when he saw a 
          UFO and then found himself in a strange room surrounded by little aliens. Shortly later, 
          he and his entire family had a close up sighting of a UFO. But it wasn’t until <b>November 
          15, 1959</b> that Nick (now 16) recalled a lengthy and complicated onboard encounter. While 
          driving with two friends in California, a UFO pulled their car onboard. Nick’s two friends 
          fell unconscious, but Nick remained awake as small human-like ETs with large dark eyes and 
          pale skin pulled him from the car and took him to another room. The ETs were kind and 
          gentle as they put him on a table and examined him with strange instruments. The encounter 
          changed his life forever.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF KLAUS-DIETER KAUFMANN</b>. At <b>8:30 pm one night in the Spring of 
          1960</b>, 14-year-old Klaus-Dieter Kaufmann walked to his home in Frankfurt, Germany. 
          Suddenly a Saturn-shaped craft hovered overhead. A beam of light came down, struck him, 
          and rendered him unconscious. He woke up a few hours later. Terrified, he ran home and 
          found a strange mark on his back. Years later, as an adult, he went to have surgery and 
          the doctor told him that it looked like he had already had surgery on his back. Klaus-
          Dieter recalled his missing time encounter with the UFO, and began to remember what 
          happened. He recalled going onboard the craft, meeting different kinds of humanoids, 
          who gave him a strange exam. Although frightened, one of the ETs comforted him and 
          explained that he would be returned home shortly.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF GILBERTO GREGORIO COCCIOLI</b>. At <b>3am on Oct 4, 1972</b>, Gilberto 
          Coccioli (age 50) stepped outside his home in Burzaco, Argentina to check on his dog. 
          Without warning, he was struck by a beam of light and pulled onboard a craft hovering 
          overhead. Inside, he was confronted by 7-foot-tall humanoids who placed him on a circular 
          bench, and examined him. He saw many things beyond his comprehension. Two other women were 
          onboard and had intimate relations with him. He saw a small pile of stones and convinced 
          the ETs to give him one. Then he was placed back on the ground, with the stone in his 
          hand. His dog was badly traumatized. The stone turned out to be earthly iron pyrite. 
          Gilberto remained in contact with the ETs, who began to teach him science, philosophy, 
          and spirituality.</p>

          <p><b>THE CASE OF ISTVAN BALOGH</b>. On the <b>night of Dec 26, 1991</b>, Istvan Balogh 
          (a 21-year-old border guard) returned home to find a flying saucer hovering over his 
          backyard in Bekes, Hungary. A week prior to this, he had heard a strange telepathic 
          message, repeating, “You will meet us.” He was unable to resist as he was pulled onboard 
          the craft where he was greeted by short humanoids, four feet tall with greenish skin, 
          large eyes, and three fingers on each hand. They told him that they had watched him for 
          three years and would take him on a trip. He recalls seeing the moon and other strange 
          sights before being returned to his yard. He told his superiors what happened to him and 
          was promptly fired. A psychiatric exam showed him to be a normal, but a physical exam 
          showed that a metal rod which had been placed after breaking his arm, was now missing.</p>

          <p>These 5 cases show that people all over the world are being taken onboard UFOs and 
          that it has been happening for a long time. This kind of experience is far more common 
          than most people believe. The evidence speaks for itself: we are not alone!</p>

          <h5>May 17, 2024 (1:03:12)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">So many humanoids! Encounters with humanoids and extraterrestrials 
          are far more common than most people believe. Cases come from across the world and have been 
          occurring for a long time. And in almost all cases people describe humanoid figures. In 
          fact, the humanoid form appears to be universal. This video presents twelve amazing humanoid 
          encounters from 1940 to 2009. Some are single-witness cases, but most have multiple 
          witnesses, and a few have compelling physical evidence in support of their case. There are 
          now enough documented cases to conclude that we are not alone on planet Earth. We are being 
          visited.</p>
          
          <p><b>SOLDIERS OR ALIENS</b>. In <b>July of 1940</b>, a 15-year-old boy from Kongens Tisded, 
          Denmark was going to water his cattle when he came upon three figures wearing jumpsuits and 
          helmets. To his shock, they approached a landed disc-shaped craft which took off silently. 
          He thought they might be German soldiers, but later realized he may have encountered ETs.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE OLD THIN ALIEN</b>. One <b>day in the summer of 1951</b>, three people went to a 
          play in Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritime, France. Approaching the theater, they saw a small 
          transparent craft low in the sky, and inside it was an old, thin, man with a beard, 
          watching the play. The witnesses tried to alert the audience, but the craft quickly darted 
          away.</p>

          <p><b>THE ARTISTS & THE ALIENS</b>. At <b>3:30 am on December 28, 1954</b>, seven people 
          drove along Route 143 near Mendoza, Argentina. Suddenly, they came upon a landed craft and 
          two humanoids along the road. They exited their vehicle and got a closer look, as the 
          humanoids scrambled into their craft. The witnesses retreated to their car and left, and 
          the UFO followed!</p>

          <p><b>A CHURCH-GOING ALIEN</b>. On the <b>night of June 26, 1962</b>, the Massolongo 
          family was in their home in Verona, Italy when they saw a UFO hover over the Santa 
          Anastasia Church. It remained there so long, they finally went to bed. Later that night, 
          a glowing green humanoid approached the bedroom window and touched the daughter. All 
          three witnesses watched it leave.</p>

          <p><b>AN APPOINTMENT WITH HUMANOIDS</b>. On <b>October 29, 1965</b>, Sture Johnson 
          received a message that she and her husband Turid (a famous medium) should visit a 
          certain location in Vagarro, Sweden. They went there that evening, and to their 
          amazement encountered black floating humanoids. But were these ETs, or were they 
          something else entirely?</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS BY THE HOSPITAL</b>. At <b>10:30 am on September 14, 1967</b>, Fabio J 
          Diniz (age 16) was walking by the Baleia Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Brazil when he 
          saw a landed saucer in a nearby field. Two tall humanoids exited and told Fabio to 
          return the next day for another contact. Unfortunately the craft did not return, but 
          it did leave behind landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>THE RECUMBENT ALIENS</b>. One <b>night in September 1973</b>, a couple and their 
          friend were driving near Alijo, Portugal when a glowing disc began to pace their car. 
          Suddenly the car mysteriously broke down. The disc left, then returned. and all three 
          witnesses saw two humanoids lying on their backs alongside the road. The humanoids rose 
          and flew over the car and were gone.</p>

          <p><b>LANDING AND HUMANOIDS IN BOZEMAN</b>. One <b>summer evening in 1978</b>, “Bob” was 
          driving outside of Bozeman, Montana when he saw a bright light alongside the road. 
          Thinking there was a fire, he stopped to investigate. Instead he saw a landed craft and 
          three little humanoids. He hid and watched until the humanoids entered the craft which 
          took off and was gone.</p>

          <p><b>A SUNNY DAY WITH ALIENS</b>. One day in <b>May 1979</b>, a family of four exited 
          their apartment in Toronto, Canada when they saw a huge oval-shaped craft hovering mere 
          feet above their building. To their amazement, about thirty humanoid figures were visible 
          through the portholes. They watched for 10 minutes until the craft zoomed away at high 
          speed.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE BOY IN THE UFO</b>. At <b>6pm on Sep 1, 1984</b>, six-year-old Nao 
          Nishimoto was amazed to see a flying saucer hovering over the field in front of her 
          home in Takamatsu, Japan. Suddenly a face appeared in one of the portholes. It was a 
          little boy, smiling down at her. As the craft left, the little boy waved goodbye.</p>

          <p><b>THE SMILING ALIENS</b>. One <b>night in July 1992</b>, Reuben Taylor and his mom 
          drove long the 101 Freeway in Echo Park, near Los Angeles, California when a huge craft 
          appeared overhead. The craft moved closer and they were amazed to see several human-
          looking ETs looking down and smiling at them.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN TOUR BUS</b>. One <b>night in November 2009</b>, an anonymous man was in his 
          home in Schwindegg, Germany when he noticed an object in the sky only 300 feet away. It 
          looked like a floating bus, and inside he saw several humanoid figures staring back at 
          him. He shouted in fear as the UFO quickly moved away.</p>

          <p>These twelve cases are just a small sample of the huge number of documented accounts 
          of humanoids coming from across the world. These cases make it clear that we live in a 
          universe populated by all different kinds of people. We are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">So many cases of humanoids! The general public has no real 
          idea just how many people are having these experiences. This video presents twelve 
          incredible cases of humanoid encounters from across the planet, from the <b>1950s to 
          the 2020s</b>. Robotic entities, human-looking ETs, little green men, grays, and more. 
          And of course, compelling evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, landing traces, 
          medical effects, and more. Truth is coming out!</p>

          <p><b>BACKYARD ALIENS</b>. Around <b>9pm on December 15, 1956</b>, Marie Carow stepped 
          into her backyard in Conashaugh, PA. She was hoping to see deer, but instead observed 
          two four-foot-tall helmeted figures staring at her. She called her husband, but he 
          refused to come outside. Later, she found out her neighbors saw a UFO at the same time.</p>
          
          <p><b>HUMANOIDS IN PONTEJOS</b>. On the <b>evening of January 9, 1969</b>, four employees 
          at a café-bar in Pontejos, Spain received an incredible shock when they saw a UFO with 
          five humanoids hovering right across the street. Unknown to them, another witness also 
          viewed the object. It remained for a short time then darted away. Could it have been 
          interested in a nearby nuclear facility?</p>

          <p><b>ROCK-COLLECTING ALIENS</b>. Around <b>4am one evening in February 1969</b>, a 
          family of four was awakened by light streaming into their home along the beach near 
          Nuble, Chile. Looking outside, they watched a strange craft land and tall humanoids 
          emerge, poke the sand with weird tubes, and start collecting rocks. After the encounter, 
          they all broke out in a strange rash.</p>

          <p><b>ENCOUNTER WITH A UFO PILOT</b>. On <b>October 5, 1971</b>, pilot Jose Americo 
          Medeiros and three other student pilots were coming in for a landing at Santos Dumont 
          Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when a UFO began pacing their plane. Suddenly it 
          darted forward and crossed right in front of them. They were shocked to see a gray-
          skinned humanoid looking right at them.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS AT THE TRAIN STATION</b>. Just before <b>midnight on June 25, 1974</b>, 
          three employees of the Tandil Railway Station in Argentina were shocked to see a bright 
          light outside, followed by the appearance of a short, bearded humanoid. It disappeared 
          after a few moments. One of the men was so traumatized, he suffered a nervous breakdown. 
          The next day, two other people also reported a humanoid in the same area.</p>

          <p><b>THE ROBOT IN THE FOREST</b>. On the <b>night of August 15, 1974</b>, a group of 
          nine witnesses observed a boxy-looking, glowing white, robotic-figure in the La Pelouse 
          Park of Bouxiere-Aux-Dames, France. Soon more witnesses also began reporting a strange 
          glowing figure in the same area. Researchers later discovered a long history of 
          encounters in the area dating back to the 1920s.</p>

          <p><b>LANDING IN TASMANIA</b>. Early one <b>morning in February 1976</b>, an anonymous 
          gentleman from Kettering, Tasmania saw a strange craft come in for a crash landing. 
          Rushing to the site, he was shocked instead to see a small disc-shaped object landed a 
          short distance away. He could see strange forms inside the craft. When it departed, 
          weird landing traces were left on the ground.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOIDS IN LITTLE HAVEN</b>. In the <b>middle of the night on April 19, 1977</b>, 
          Rosa Grenville, a hotelier at the Haven Fort Hotel in Little Haven, Wales was shocked 
          to see a landed UFO and humanoids right outside her window. Viewing through binoculars 
          she was amazed to see that they wore strange jumpsuits. She tried to wake her husband, 
          but the craft took off before he could see it.</p>

          <p><b>THREE HUMANOIDS IN A SATURN-SHAPED UFO</b>. After seeing strange lights throughout 
          <b>early July 1979</b> over their home in Schiedam, the Netherlands, two teenagers were 
          amazed to see a Saturn-shaped craft with humanoids inside it, hovering very near the 
          balcony of their home. They also began reporting a wide variety of psychic events.</p>

          <p><b>LITTLE GREEN MEN</b>. While driving to her home in Niva, Denmark late on the 
          <b>evening of September 28, 1988</b>, an anonymous woman was shocked to see two very 
          short greenish humanoids with large heads and pointed chins walking along the road. She 
          pulled a U-turn to get a closer look, but they were gone.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE WINDOW</b>. On the <b>night of June 27, 2014</b>, a woman from 
          St-Croix, Quebec, Canada was amazed to see a UFO over her home. When her son arrived 
          home shortly later, he reported seeing a short, large-headed humanoid peering in 
          through the backdoor window.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS BY THE CROSS</b>. On <b>May 3, 2022</b>, 88-year-old Lyubov Danilova 
          Smolskaya of Belarus, Russia woke to her home filling with light. Looking outside she 
          saw a landed craft and two bizarre-looking humanoids. They shone a beam of light on her, 
          then got into the craft which floated away. After it was gone, strange landing traces 
          were found.</p>

          <p>These twelve incredible humanoid encounter cases make it very clear that people all 
          over the world are having these experiences. There are too many cases to ignore, explain 
          away or cover-up. The truth can no longer be denied. UFOs are real, and we are being 
          visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Humanoid and alien encounters! They are perhaps the most 
          fascinating aspect of ufology, and have so much to teach us about the ET agenda. This 
          video presents ten cases from all over the world involving a wide variety of 
          extraterrestrials. There are human-looking ETs, little dwarfs, frog-like beings, flying 
          humanoids and more. Many involve multiple witnesses and startling physical evidence 
          such as landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions and electromagnetic disturbances. 
          There are too many cases to ignore, deny or explain away. Something very profound is 
          happening here.</p>

          <p><b>TEN LITTLE ALIENS</b>. One <b>evening in January 1931</b>, cattle-herder Helge 
          Eriksson was walking to his home in Eslov, Sweden when he saw a crowd of ten little men 
          coming towards him. They were only about four feet tall, with oversized heads and long 
          beards. They wore one piece robes with hoods and seemed to float across the ground. They 
          paid no attention to Helge and moved up to a brilliant light source and were gone.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE PURPLE CAPE</b>. It was a <b>sunny afternoon on February 29, 1964</b> 
          as David and Ken (age 10 and 9) saw a saucer land near their homes in Plympton, South 
          Australia. To their shock, a door opened and out stepped a human-looking ET with copper-red 
          skin and a big nose. It wore a strange suit with a purple cape. As soon as it saw the boys, 
          it fled back into its craft, which promptly took off. Interestingly, not far away, another 
          lady in Gum Tree, South Australia saw a very similar-looking ET.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS ON THE HIGHWAY</b>. Around <b>4am on August 23, 1967</b>, Stanley Moxon 
          was driving near Joyceville, Ontario, Canada when he saw a glowing green craft descending 
          alongside the road. He turned off his headlights, drove up to it, and flicked on his 
          headlights. To his shock, it had landed, and two short ETs were outside picking plants. 
          Surprised, they flew back into the craft which took off straight up.</p>

          <p><b>THE FLYING HUMANOID</b>. One <b>night in 1967</b>, Patricia K and her fiancé were 
          driving near Wolstanton, England when she saw a classic flying saucer. It flew away 
          before her fiancé could see it. But eight years later, their 8-year-old son was drawn to 
          look outside by a loud buzzing noise. To his amazement, he saw two 3-foot-tall humanoids 
          flying past his window mere feet away.</p>

          <p><b>I WOULD NOT HARM A HAIR ON YOUR HEAD</b>. Around <b>3:15 am on January 8, 1974</b>, 
          John E Justice was driving to his home in Springfield, Ohio when his car stalled and his 
          lights went out. Instantly, a brilliant rainbow-colored light appeared, transforming into 
          a small craft. Inside, he was shocked to see five female humanoids, each about four feet 
          tall, with super-long hair. The craft darted away after a few moments, but one year later, 
          he had an even more startling encounter with a humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS REALLY AFRAID</b>. On the <b>night of November 17, 1975</b>, two college 
          students, Dave Vardeman and Suzanne Erenberger watched a brilliant light descend to the 
          ground near Cedar-Rapids, Iowa. Suzanne was amazed to see a metallic craft with two 
          humanoids inside. But strangely, Dave didn’t remember seeing any craft or humanoids. All 
          he recalls is that they were both frightened enough to flee the area and call the police.</p>

          <p><b>FIFTY FROG-LIKE ETS</b>. At <b>9pm on May 2, 1976</b>, Dominique Menuge was driving 
          near Matton France when reflections off the side of the road caught his eye. To his shock, 
          he saw about fifty 4-foot-tall frog-like humanoids standing motionless in the field. 
          Terrified, he fled the area, but not before he saw one of the humanoids standing only a 
          few feet away from his car.</p>

          <p><b>ALMOST ABDUCTED BY ALIENS</b>. On <b>September 9, 1976</b>, Hermelindo Silva was 
          walking home with his dog when a UFO appeared overhead. Suddenly it sent down 4 cables 
          with hooks. Short little humanoids came out of the craft and managed to grab him, hook 
          his ankle and pull him up towards the craft. Hermelindo fought with them and freed 
          himself, but not without sustaining some serious injuries.</p>

          <p><b>UNNATURAL EYES</b>. On the <b>night of March 13, 1977</b>, 17-year-old Stephen 
          Taylor was walking to his home in Pembroke, Wales when he saw a brilliant orange craft. 
          He ran away, but shortly later, he came upon the craft, now landed in a field. Then an 
          odd humanoid with frog-like eyes, wearing a jumpsuit walked right up to him. Stephen 
          swung a punch, missed, and ran home in complete terror.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN WITH A MUSTACHE</b>. On the <b>night of December 1, 1977</b>, Emilio 
          Ruiz woke to find the bedroom of his home in Puente San Miguel, Spain, filling with 
          light. Looking out the window, he saw a tall figure approach and peer inside. To his 
          shock, it wasn’t human. He screamed and the figure walked away. Later, he discovered 
          that numerous people in the town had seen unexplained lights.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, from across the planet, all involving a wide variety of humanoids and 
          aliens. These cases show that contact with ETs can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. 
          The evidence cannot be denied. We are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Apr 26, 2024 (1:09:16)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO contact is known for high strangeness. When people encounter 
          ETs face-to-face, or are taken onboard, things can go from strange to truly bizarre. This 
          video presents five cases from across the world, which contain incredibly odd and unique 
          elements of high strangeness. Each of these five cases include sightings, landings, humanoids, 
          and an onboard experience. Each contain physical evidence of some kind or another. These cases 
          have some remarkable insights into the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE CASE OF CATHIE CONNELLY</b>. In the <b>summer of 1940</b>, Cathie Connelly was 
          walking down a country lane in Meriden, England when she came upon a small, strange 
          structure. There were tall odd-looking men wearing jumpsuits standing near it. When she 
          returned later, it was gone. Later, while working at a factory, she saw one of the men 
          she had seen next to this craft, and he told Cathie that he was an ET. So began Cathie’s 
          contacts. She was soon taken onboard. She saw human-looking people and blue-skinned 
          beings with cat-like eyes. She was physically examined and given a tour of the craft. 
          They took her to an active war-area and to New York, showing her the Statue of Liberty. 
          Many other incidents of high strangeness occurred, including going back in time to 
          certain childhood events, and to a country in Africa.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE CASE OF ARNE-HARDER JORGENSENM</b>. One day in <b>Aug of 1956</b>, Arne-Harder 
          Jorgensen (age 10) played Cowboys & Indians with his friends near his home in Vaklev, 
          Denmark. Suddenly he heard foreign-sounding voices and laughter. Peaking outside of his 
          hiding place, he saw three short, bald humanoids wearing jumpsuits and eating berries 
          from a berry bush. Suddenly the ETs turned and stared right at him. Arne tried to run, 
          but found that he couldn’t move. One of the humanoids studied him up and down, and 
          walked away. Then, a silver saucer-shape craft took off. Arne’s paralysis lifted. He 
          ran home to find that it was now dusk. The next morning, they discovered four deep 
          holes in the ground. Also three chickens were missing from a neighbor’s coop. Later, 
          Arne had two close-up UFO sightings.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE CASE OF ONILSON PATERO</b>. On the <b>night of May 22, 1973</b>, Onilson 
          Patero was driving to his him in Catanduva, Brazil when he picked up a hitchhiker, a 
          young blond-haired, blue-eyed man. As he dropped off the hitchhiker, the man said they 
          would meet again. Continuing his drive, Onilson’s car suddenly lost power. A UFO 
          appeared and shone a beam of light onto his car, turning it transparent. Onilson ran 
          from his car and fainted. He was found unconscious lying next to the road. One year 
          later, on the <b>night of Apr 26, 1974</b>, Onilson saw another UFO. He was struck 
          by a beam of light, and taken onboard, where he saw the same hitchhiker. Onilson was 
          given an exam and experienced many strange events onboard, including seeing his own 
          twin, being taken to another country in Europe and more. The ETs dropped him off. It 
          was now six days later and he was 745 miles from his original location.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE CASE OF DAVID HAMELM</b>. On <b>Oct 12, 1975</b>, David Hamel (a carpenter,) 
          his wife Ruth and a friend were watching TV in his home in Maple Ridge, Canada. Suddenly 
          the TV screen became staticky and two Asian-looking figures appeared and pulled David up 
          into a craft. David was given a tour of the craft, and volumes of scientific and 
          philosophical information. The ETs warned him about nuclear power, and then told him 
          that they would give him detailed instructions about how to build a free-energy motor. 
          Returning him to his home, David’s life changed as he remained in contact with the ETs. 
          David began a lifelong quest to build a UFO craft, using a concept of counter-rotating 
          magnets. David spent thousands of dollars and eventually built a motor, which 
          spontaneously exploded. He continued his efforts, eventually attracting the attention 
          of prominent scientists. Two books have been written about his case.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE CASE OF ELIZABETH HESS</b>. In <b>1954</b>, 13-year-old Elizabeth Hess 
          (pseudonym) and her mother experienced missing time during a trip to the store near 
          their home in New York City. Years later, in <b>November 1989</b>, Elizabeth woke up 
          to find three strange humanoids in her Manhattan apartment. They led her down the 
          street to the Hudson River, where she met a tall gray and 30 other people who had also 
          been led there. A strange experience followed where Elizabeth was instructed to pick a 
          glass and give it to a homeless woman. Next, Elizabeth was back in her home, undergoing 
          a medical procedure at the hands of the ETs, who told her to quit smoking and eating 
          chocolate. Later, Elizabeth had miscarriages where the fetus was missing.</p>
          
          <p>These five cases typify the high strangeness that is so often present during UFO 
          contact. They reveal some of the ETs’ agendas on this planet, and that people all over 
          the world are experiencing contact with a wide variety of humanoids. The evidence speaks 
          for itself. We are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Apr 19, 2024 (1:11:48)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different kinds of strange humanoids being 
          reported by people all over the world, and it’s been happening for a long time. It’s 
          definitely not just grays! In fact, the variety of ET types is far more numerous than 
          most people realize. This video presents ten cases from across the world, spanning five 
          decades, from the 1950s to the 1990s. Many involve multiple witnesses and different 
          forms of evidence. But most fascinating are all the amazing kinds of ETs.</p>

          <p><b>BROWN-SKINNED MIDGET ETS</b>. One <b>afternoon in the Fall of 1957</b>, a 15-year-
          old boy was working in the fields south of the small town of Ejstrupholm, Denmark when 
          a metallic craft landed just 100 feet away. To his utter shock, two 3-foot-tall brown-
          skinned ETs wearing transparent helmets emerged. After a few minutes, they returned to 
          the craft, which took off. The witness was so amazed, he told almost nobody.</p>

          <p><b>LOVERS LANE ALIENS</b>. Late <b>one evening in the Fall of 1966</b>, a young couple 
          drove to an isolated location outside of Rockford, Illinois to enjoy each other’s company 
          in private. Without warning, a bright light appeared overhead. They quickly pulled a U-turn 
          to flee the area, but before they could get away, they saw two gray figures with big black 
          eyes staring back at them. It was an experience they would never forget.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS IN MELON FIELD</b>. Around <b>dusk on September 12, 1971</b>, Juan Rodriguez 
          Dominguez, who worked as a guard for the giant El Lunarejo melon farm in Aznalcollar, Spain, 
          got the shock of his life when a massive, silver, torpedo-shaped craft landed a short distance 
          away. Dozens of tiny figures wearing uniforms emerged. When Juan confronted them, the ETs 
          chased him, shooting paralyzing lights rays at him.</p>

          <p><b>NUCLEAR RESEARCHER HUMANOID ENCOUNTER</b>. On the <b>night of June 29, 1973</b>, a 
          nuclear researcher/professor was driving with his wife south of Chalk River, Ontario, Canada 
          when they noticed a star-like object pacing their car. Soon it came closer, revealing itself 
          to be a spherical craft with portholes, and through them they could see humanoid figures. And 
          it crossed the road right in front of their car.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOID INVESTIGATES GRAVESITE</b>. On the <b>evening of July 23, 1977</b>, a family 
          in Lindley, New York were shocked to see multiple UFOs, and then little humanoids running 
          around their backyard. They watched it do strange things to a gravestone nearby. The witnesses 
          finally called the police and the UFOs and humanoids quickly left. But this was just the 
          beginning of a weeks-long series of incredible encounters.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS IN THE FLYING BOX</b>. One <b>Summer evening in 1978</b>, an anonymous gentleman 
          was walking his dog near his home in Beeston, England when he saw something he could hardly 
          believe: a box-shaped craft floating just above the rooftops. Most amazing, inside he saw 
          several 10-foot-tall skinny figures wearing strange jumpsuits. A few of them saw the witness 
          and waved at him before slowly moving away.</p>

          <p><b>ETS OFFER CAKE</b>. On the <b>evening of December 3, 1979</b>, teen-ager Lilli-Ann 
          Karlsson was taking a walk in the park near her home in Vastervick, Sweden. Suddenly paralyzed, 
          she found herself confronted by a craft in the field right next to her. Two ETs emerged and 
          began to float towards her. They were 5 feet tall, white and glowing. They approached her, 
          holding a piece of what looked like chocolate cake.</p>

          <p><b>THREE LITTLE FLOATING ALIENS</b>. Around <b>dusk on January 12, 1983</b>, Ed Eggen 
          (pseudonym) and his two young sons were shocked to see a little bald man wearing a gray 
          jumpsuit outside their home in Pine Township, Indiana. They ran outside to investigate. 
          Seconds later, they noticed a second figure, and then a third. They approached within feet 
          of them before all three figures converged and darted off into the sky.</p>

          <p><b>THE GLOWING GIANT</b>. Late in the <b>evening of March 6, 1983</b>, Madame Fauquembergue 
          was in her home in Pas-de-Calais, France when she noticed a strange glowing figure moving 
          around outside her home. Looking more closely, she saw it was 7 or 8 feet tall and wearing 
          a silver jumpsuit. Earlier that evening, she and her family had been puzzled when the entire 
          house lit up with light.</p>

          <p><b>THE SHRUGGING GRAY</b>. It was about <b>2:00 am on July 21, 1991</b>, when 3 young girls 
          decided to go outside and jump on the trampoline in the backyard of their home in a small town 
          in central Missouri. They all saw a strange light, and moments later, a 4-foot-tall gray figure 
          approached them. The girls fled into their home, but the gray then began to stare at them through 
          the window, and kept doing for a period of hours.</p>

          <p>These ten cases provide a small sample of the huge number of cases taking place across the 
          planet. These cases show unique aspects and corroborating similarities. The evidence includes 
          landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, and more. Each case provides another piece 
          of the puzzle, and shows us that we are not alone. Humans are just one of many types of intelligent 
          life in this vast universe.</p>

          <h5>Apr 12, 2024 (1:16:33)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO sightings, landings and face-to-face encounters with 
          extraterrestrials are all undeniably interesting. But perhaps the most extraordinary 
          of all UFO encounters are cases where people have been taken onboard a craft. These 
          cases leave little room for misperception or denial. They represent the cutting edge 
          of UFO research, and make it very clear that we are not alone. This video presents 
          five extensive onboard UFO encounters from across the world. Three of these cases 
          involve multiple witnesses. All of them have physical evidence. But most important, 
          these five cases show what it’s like to have an onboard UFO encounter and interact 
          directly with ETs.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF PROFESSOR JOAO DE FREITAS GUIMARAES</b>. On the <b>night 
          of July 16, 1956</b>, Joao de Freitas Guimaraes was taking a walk along the beach in 
          San Sebastiao, Brazil. Sitting down to rest, he was shocked to see a craft emerge from 
          the ocean, fly towards him, and land on the beach. Two human-looking figures wearing 
          jumpsuits emerged and invited him onboard the craft. Inside, Joao was amazed to see 
          how advanced the craft was. Looking out a porthole, he saw the craft zoom into outer 
          space. The ETs warned him about humanity’s savage nature and use of atomic weapons. 
          They promised to meet him again and returned him to the beach. At first Joao kept his 
          experience a secret, but word leaked out to the press and Joao’s story was published 
          widely in newspapers. And soon he would have another encounter.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS OF LYDIA STALNAKER</b>. In <b>1955</b>, at age 9, Lydia 
          Stalnaker and her two siblings walked near their home in Jacksonville, Florida. Suddenly 
          there was a flash of light and a strange man began to approach. They ran home in fear. 
          Lydia didn’t realize it, but she had been taken onboard a UFO. Later in <b>1974</b>, 
          Lydia (now age 28) drove outside Jacksonville and saw a UFO land near the highway. She 
          and another man pulled over. They drove together to get a closer look, and suddenly 
          Lydia lost consciousness. When a third missing-time UFO sighting occurred, Lydia sought 
          hypnosis. She learned that she had been taken onboard UFOs three times, meeting grays 
          and other humanoids. They warned her that Earth was facing future catastrophes. Lydia 
          began exhibiting psychic abilities, and before long, was taken onboard again!</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF JOE, CAROL & LUKE</b>. On the <b>night of June 20, 1976</b>, 
          a couple and their infant son were driving near Goodland, Kansas when they saw multiple 
          UFOs. After watching them and talking about how interesting it might be to be taken 
          onboard, one of the craft swooped over their car. The couple suddenly realized that 
          their car was now five miles further ahead down the road, and they were missing hours of 
          time. They also found strange marks on their body. Later, under hypnosis, they recalled 
          that they were taken onboard by friendly ETs. They were separated and given physical 
          exams. The husband experienced a profound spiritual event. All three were then returned 
          to their car with little memory of the event. Ultimately, they were profoundly changed 
          in a positive way by their encounter.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MYRIAM & SONIA</b>. While driving through Bayamon, 
          Puerto Rico, Myriam X and her mother Sonia were shocked when darkness enveloped them, 
          surrounded by intense light and a period of missing time. Suddenly they were 45 miles 
          away in Arecibo. Myriam and Sonia (both who had been ill) now found themselves 
          miraculously healed. Years later, under hypnosis, they recalled that a UFO had 
          appeared over their car. The craft pulled them and their car into the craft, where 
          they met grays and human-looking ETs. They were separated, given exams, and healed. 
          Both were also given information about the ETs, their agenda on Earth, and much more. 
          They then had a profound reunion with deceased loved ones. They were then returned 
          to their car.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF FERNANDO X</b>. One <b>evening in autumn of 1986</b>, a 
          young electrician by the name of Fernando was riding his motorcycle outside of Calleredo, 
          Spain when he saw multiple UFOs overhead. When one of them zoomed towards him, Fernando 
          jumped on his motorcycle to escape. But the engine wouldn’t work. Fernando watched in 
          awe as the UFO floated a few feet off the ground. Two gray aliens emerged and pulled him 
          onboard. Fernando was placed on a table with a bright light overhead, while the ETs 
          examined him. Shortly later he fell asleep, waking up to find himself lying next to his 
          motorcycle. The UFO and ETs were gone, and three hours had passed. Fernando rushed home 
          where he found a strange mark on his body.</p>
          
          <p>These five cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many researchers believe these cases 
          might number in the millions. These cases provide incontrovertible evidence of onboard 
          UFO encounters. The time has come for truth and transparency on this subject. There are 
          too many cases to ignore; we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <h5>Apr 5, 2024 (1:19:47)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It’s one of the strangest and most fantastic experiences a 
          person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an actual ET. And yet it happens more 
          often than you might think. This video presents ten cases in which people have 
          experienced humanoid encounters. These include all different types of humanoids, from 
          short three-foot-tall childlike ETs, to beings almost fifteen feet tall. These cases 
          come from all over the world. Many of these cases are supported by multiple firsthand 
          eyewitness testimony and a wide variety of physical evidence. Are you ready for 
          contact? Because as these cases show, it can happen when you least expect it.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN THE FOREST</b>. It was <b>7am one morning in the Summer of 1956</b> 
          as MME L took a walk near her home in Vitry-les-Nogent. She was entering the Marsois 
          Forest, right next to the famous Dolmen Pierre Alot when she saw what she thought were 
          two children. But as she approached, she realized they wore jumpsuits and helmets. They 
          were not human!</p>
          
          <p><b>UFO LANDS IN DRAKESTOWN</b>. Around <b>7pm on December 30, 1957</b>, George 
          Chowanski stepped outside his home in Drakestown, NJ to chop some wood. His dog began 
          howling as a buzzing sound filled the air. The sky filled with a glowing light and 
          suddenly a flying saucer landed in his backyard. Out stepped three humanoids who 
          apparently found something of interest in his backyard.</p>

          <p><b>ETS ABDUCT A FIR TREE</b>. One <b>night in 1961</b>, Valborg Agren and her friend 
          Tilda were outside the town of Hallviken, Sweden when they noticed a strange light in 
          the field just off the road. Stopping to investigate, they were amazed to see three 
          short figures holding devices that sent red sparks up the trunk of a fir tree. After 
          watching for several minutes, it slowly dawned on them that these figures were not human.</p>

          <p><b>THE VIOLET-YELLOW GIANTS</b>. In the middle of the <b>night on January 14, 1969</b>, 
          the Vas family of Childers, Australia woke to their dog barking and a buzzing noise 
          outside their home. Going outside, all four family members saw a large craft overhead. 
          Suddenly three giant figures in boxy suits exited and began to pick the plants and take 
          soil samples from their yard. Then one of the figures approached!</p>

          <p><b>OFFICER GEORGE WHEELER AND THE UFO</b>. On the <b>evening of April 6, 1975</b>, 
          police officer George Wheeler of Elmwood, Wisconsin was shocked as a fiery oval UFO 
          flew right over his cruiser. He was so shocked that he hoped to have another encounter. 
          One year later, it happened: he saw a structured craft with a humanoid looking out the 
          window. His life was never the same, especially when people in town began reporting their 
          own encounters.</p>

          <p><b>ANOTHER MICHELIN MAN ET</b>. On the <b>night of March 14, 1976</b>, a couple was 
          driving outside of Valencia, Spain when they noticed a strange glowing object in a field 
          off the roadway. Moments later, they saw a strange humanoid figure which looked like the 
          famous “Michelin Man.” He did not appear to be human as he was floating above the ground. 
          As they passed by him, their car’s electrical system failed.</p>

          <p><b>A FAMILY ENCOUNTER</b>. At <b>10am on August 6, 1976</b>, Freddy Chiasson, his wife, 
          Claire and their two teenage sons drove through Gaspesie National Park in Quebec, Canada. 
          It was very foggy as they saw a beam of light ahead of them on the road. Next, they saw a 
          craft zoom towards them and land. Going to investigate, they saw two 7-foot-tall humanoids. 
          They fled back to their vehicle and the UFO departed.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS IN THE GROCERY STORE</b>. On <b>September 10, 1978</b>, three boys were 
          watching TV in their home in Burruyaco, Argentina. Suddenly, their TV stopped working, 
          as did their record player and radio. Then they heard a noise in their father’s store 
          which was attached to the house. Going to investigate, they saw two 3-foot-tall humanoids 
          who had trespassed into the store.</p>

          <p><b>THE MINIATURE UFO & THE 6-FOOT-TALL ALIEN</b>. On the <b>night of September 15, 1978</b>, 
          following a wave of sightings over Carpentersville, IL, a secretary living in the suburbs 
          was awakened by a loud buzzing noise. Going to investigate, she saw a tall silver-suited 
          figure standing outside her home. Even stranger, she saw a tiny flying saucer (3 feet wide 
          and 2 feet tall) sitting right next to her home. She woke her husband, and they tried to 
          call the police, but their phone wouldn’t work.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ETS BY THE LAKE</b>. On <b>August 10, 1979</b>, two witnesses saw a strange 
          object on the lake near Czluchow, Poland. One of them ran to investigate more closely 
          and saw two humanoids float into the forest. Shortly later, he and several other 
          witnesses saw the craft rise and dart away. Two dogs who ran up to the humanoids later 
          suffered a strange illness.</p>

          <p>The time for skepticism, ridicule and disbelief is over. How many cases will it take 
          before the world recognizes that we are not alone? The evidence speak for itself. UFOs 
          and extraterrestrials are real!</p>

          <h5>Mar 29, 2024 (1:08:23)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">With so many people stepping forward to share their experiences 
          of extraterrestrial contact, it’s clear that these encounters are far more common than 
          previously believed. It’s difficult to say exactly how common contact is, but some 
          researchers believe it numbers in the millions. This video presents ten cases of contact 
          with humanoid ETs of various kinds, coming from all over the world, from the <b>1930s 
          through the 1990s</b>. Most of these cases involve extensive interactions with the ETs, 
          including conversations. And of course, physical evidence of many kinds. As these cases 
          show, ET contact is very real.</p>
          
          <p><b>IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS</b>. One <b>night in 1938</b>, Malcolm B Perry 
          was walking to his home in Somerville, Massachusetts when an odd airborne object caught 
          his eye. It was blimp-shaped with several portholes. Looking down at him through one of 
          the portholes was a humanoid. Malcolm was overcome with a feeling of friendship, and as 
          the craft zoomed off, a sense of loss swept over him.</p>

          <p><b>DON’T LOOK UP!</b> It was a <b>hot day in summer of 1967</b> as a 16-year-old boy 
          and his brother played outside their home in Langley Prairie, British Columbia, Canada. 
          Without warning, a dome-shaped craft landed nearby and praying mantis ETs emerged. One 
          of the figures approached the witness, speaking telepathically with him. After the 
          beings left, both witnesses were affected both physically and emotionally.</p>

          <p><b>ALL LIFE IS ONE</b>. On <b>May 10, 1957</b>, Shirley McBride drove near Lake 
          Isabella in southern California. Feeling a sudden urge to pull over and admire the 
          scenery, she was fascinated to see a small glowing sphere approach. Moments later, it 
          landed next to her. Inside she saw two humanoids who began to communicate telepathically. 
          Afterward, she forgot the encounter, but later recalled it hypnotically.</p>

          <p><b>THE CURIOUS ALIEN</b>. On <b>August 25, 1958</b>, Mr. Neumann sat in a vacation 
          cabin in Harja, Sweden, reading a book when a feeling of being watched overcame him. 
          Looking at the window, he saw a short humanoid staring at him. Rushing outside to 
          investigate, he chased the figure to a saucer-shaped craft which had landed in a nearby 
          field. The craft took off, leaving behind landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS ON ROUTE 7</b>. At <b>10pm on October 21, 1967</b>, four teenage boys driving 
          along Route 7 in Duncan, Oklahoma were shocked to see three short humanoids floating along 
          the highway in front of them. The figures quickly jumped into a ravine. The boys called 
          the police who believed them but refused to investigate. The next day, the boys returned to 
          the spot and found a strange footprint.</p>

          <p><b>ANOTHER DAM UFO</b>. On the <b>night of December 6, 1978</b>, Jesus Antunes Moreira 
          was in the guardhouse at the Marimbondo Hydroelectric Dam in Frontiera, Brazil when a UFO 
          appeared overhead, then landed on the dam a short distance away. Three human-looking ETs 
          exited the craft and began to speak with Jesus. But when they began to take rocks from the 
          dam area, Jesus protested and the ETs departed.</p>

          <p><b>TRUCKER ENCOUNTER</b>. Just before <b>midnight on December 15, 1978</b>, truckdriver 
          Angelo Capuzzello was driving along Highway 514 near Licodia, Sicily when his radio failed. 
          Pulling over, Angela saw a glowing object just off the road. Shortly later, two humanoids 
          approached and began to converse with him in a strange language. They quickly departed, but 
          afterwards, their footprints could be seen.</p>

          <p><b>DON’T BE SCARED</b>. It was <b>6:30 pm on August 8, 1951</b> as RK walked along a path 
          by the resort town of Chalupy, Poland. His walk was interrupted when two weird figures 
          approached. They had large eyes, a slit for a mouth, and wore green jumpsuits. Moments 
          later, he saw a silver disc a short distance away. The beings spoke with RK, and the next 
          thing he knew, 15 minutes had elapsed. He had missing time.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS AT THE URANIUM FACTORY</b>. On <b>December 12, 1987</b>, retired restauranteur 
          Gerard Lamy went to collect wood near his home in Narbonne France, right next to the Malesi 
          Uranium Factory. To his shock, six child-like figures with Asian eyes and brown skin appeared. 
          They wore dark jumpsuits and stood next to strange-looking scooters. Gerard realized they were 
          actually ETs. The beings then boarded their scooters which levitated off the ground and 
          carried them away.</p>

          <p><b>I WAS PETRIFIED WITH FRIGHT</b>. At <b>3am on August 31, 1990</b>, Miguel Figueroa 
          drove near Lake Cartagena, Puerto Rico when he came upon a group of people along the 
          highway. They said strange creature were blocking the road ahead. Miguel went to investigate 
          and came upon four gray-skinned figures with large heads and huge eyes. He followed them 
          until they left the road. After the encounter, Miguel was threatened not to speak about his 
          encounter.</p>

          <p>These ten cases are just a brief glimpse into the huge number of encounters that have been 
          taking place across the planet. How many cases will it take before our governments disclose the 
          truth and the world recognizes that we are not the only people in this universe?</p>

          <h5>Mar 22, 2024 (1:10:01)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are real! The UFO subject is now enjoying a resurgence 
          in popularity. Governments across the world are now admitting the validity of the UFO 
          phenomenon, and more and more people are now stepping forward to share their own 
          encounters. This video presents ten cases of alien visitations from across the world, 
          seven of which involve face-to-face contact with humanoids of all different kinds. 
          Landing traces, physiological effects, unusual electromagnetic disturbances, and most 
          cases with multiple witnesses – the truth can no longer be denied. We are not alone!</p>

          <p><b>A CLOSEUP ENCOUNTER WITH HUMANOIDS</b>. On <b>November 16, 1952</b>, 40-year-old 
          farmer, Nello Ferreri stepped into the fields near his home in Castelfranco, Italy to 
          relieve himself. Suddenly a circle of light appeared on the ground around him, and 
          looking up, he saw a flying saucer hovering just overhead. Looking down at him were 
          three strange humanoids wearing rubber suits.</p>

          <p><b>THREE YOUNG GIRLS SEE A HUMANOID</b>. School had just let out for Anne Storedal 
          (age 10,) her sister Tora and their friend Tora Moy (both age 9) and they were walking 
          to their homes in Torpo, Norway. Suddenly a small black dot appeared in the sky, zoomed 
          down, and hovered only a few feet overhead. The girls could now see it was a strange, 
          spherical craft, and inside was a tiny man dressed in black staring at them.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN TOURISTS</b>. On <b>September 29, 1965</b>, Emil and Ada Carlsson stepped 
          outside their home in Arboga, Sweden and saw a boat-shaped object floating silently only 
          a few hundred feet over their heads. Inside were more than twenty people wearing bright 
          colored clothes. The strange figures were surveying the couple and the environment. The 
          Carlssons realized that they must be alien tourists!</p>

          <p><b>LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS AT WAYNESBORO, VA</b>. On the <b>morning of December 21, 
          1965</b>, Horace Burns was driving along Hwy 250 near Waynesboro, Virginia when a UFO 
          landed next to him, stalling his car. This was the start of a wave of sightings in the 
          area. One month later and a few miles away, William Blackburn encountered a landed UFO 
          and occupants. A week after that, six young men chased three humanoids again on Hwy 250. 
          Later, one of them and a photographer came upon a landed UFO and alien.</p>

          <p><b>A 13-MILE UFO CHASE</b>. On the <b>evening of January 5, 1971</b>, John Clucas (age 
          37) was driving to his home, from Penrith to Windsor, Australia. Without warning a glowing 
          object swooped down behind his car and tailgated him. John sped up and so did the object. 
          When he slowed down, the object also slowed down. No matter what John did, he couldn’t 
          outrun the UFO, and it followed him for more than 13 miles.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO THAT SUCKED</b>. One <b>summer day in 1973</b>, numerous people across 
          England observed a black UFO that moved overhead, sucking various objects into the sky. 
          Several people at Jodrell watched as it levitated hay and grass. A train driver at 
          Kidlington said it levitated a bag of coal. Residents of both Chell and Burslem also 
          saw the UFO and various items being pulled up into the sky. Strangely, nobody reported 
          any wind.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO MADE HER CRY</b>. On the <b>night of October 13, 1977</b>, Mary Arnett and 
          three others encountered a low-flying metallic disc while driving along Mobley Road in 
          rural Wetzel County, West Virginia. Upon seeing the object, Mary found herself bursting 
          into tears. As the object followed them and started to land, they drove off in fear. They 
          wanted to return to the area the next day to investigate, but they were too afraid.</p>

          <p><b>A BOX-SHAPED UFO WITH HUMANOIDS</b>. It was <b>early morning in November 1978</b> 
          when 9-year-old Dawn Smith saw a strange box-shaped object floating at low altitude 
          outside her window in Westbank, British Columbia, Canada. She was amazed to see a 
          hatch open and two dark human-looking men standing on either side of the door. Even 
          more amazing was when a large flying saucer emerged from the craft.</p>

          <p><b>THE ODENSE LANDING AND HUMANOIDS</b>. Just before <b>5am on July 16, 1982</b>, 
          a young man was bicycling to work from Odense, Denmark to Broby, when he came upon a 
          landed UFO. He jumped off his bike and walked up to it, startling five short, bald 
          humanoids who were taking samples and putting them in bags. The ETs retreated to the 
          craft which took off, leaving a circle of crushed grass on the ground.</p>
          
          <p><b>BADLANDS UFO</b>. One <b>evening in February 1982</b>, geologist Tom Brebol was 
          retiring after surveying the terrain in the wilderness of the Barber County Badlands 
          of southern, Kansas. As a strange silence enveloped the area and Tom had the feeling 
          of being watched, he ventured outside his tent and came upon a landed craft. To his 
          shock, two glowing blue figures appeared. As he snapped a photo, Tom blacked out.</p>
          
          <p>These ten cases from across the planet, spanning several decades, show the incredible 
          diversity and complexity of the UFO phenomenon and the various extraterrestrials visiting 
          our planet. And they have so much to teach us, about ourselves and life beyond Earth.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It was <b>1968</b>, and 13-year-old Carter Welles walked to 
          school with his best friend, Jackson Groves near his home in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 
          Jackson had just experienced a spontaneous out-of-body experience, and both boys were 
          amazed by the event. Together they vowed to learn how to achieve astral projection. For 
          the next two years they read everything they could find on the subject and meditated daily, 
          but were unable to get out-of-body. Then one evening, Jackson walked home along a remote 
          country highway outside of Toronto when a truckdriver offered him a ride. Jackson accepted. 
          The driver introduced himself as Peter and said, “Well, Jackson, how’s it going with the 
          astral travelling?”</p>
          
          <p>Jackson was shocked because he did not know this man, and Jackson had told nobody but 
          Carter about their attempts to have OBEs. Jackson asked Peter how he knew his name and 
          about the OBEs, and the man just smiled and said, “Oh, you know, we’ve been keeping an eye 
          on you guys.”</p>

          <p>After speaking with Peter for an hour or two, Jackson was amazed. Peter showed telepathic 
          abilities, could call forth the wind, and said he worked with extraterrestrials and had been 
          onboard UFOs. He even offered to take Jackson onboard a craft. Jackson was too scared to 
          accept the invitation, but he continued to meet with Peter and learn about spirituality, 
          psychic abilities, and UFOs.</p>

          <p>After a few visits with Peter, Jackson told Carter about him. Carter was excited and asked 
          to meet Peter too. Peter agreed, and Carter, Jackson and a couple of friends met with him. 
          Peter repeated that he worked with the aliens, displayed his ability to call forth the wind, 
          read their minds and showed other incredible abilities. The boys hammered him with questions, 
          all of which Peter answered with great wisdom and humor, often bringing the boys to tears with 
          laughter.</p>

          <p>Shortly after this visit, the boys were staying at Carter’s parents’ cottage in Rosedale, 
          Ontario. Carter was alone in the house when his friends came running in and announced that 
          they had just seen a Martian at the docks along the nearby Rosedale River Says Carter, “They 
          described it, and it was exactly like what we think of today as a gray. A little guy with a 
          big head, big eyes, a skinny little body. And they saw it. They saw this thing. And we have 
          never experienced anything like that before. So, we were very excited.”</p>

          <p>A few days later, Carter and his friends were walking over the Rosedale bridge. Carter got 
          ahead of the others, and looking over the bridge into the parking lot, he saw a strange figure. 
          He knew instantly that it was the “Martian.”</p>

          <p>“I saw this little being,” Carter said. “It looked like a little gray alien…and when I 
          first saw it, my body reacted and I kind of jerked. And it mimicked me! And I saw what it 
          did, and I kind of shook my head and looked at it. And it did the same thing. It was kind 
          of playing with me. It was really playful. I had this whole little interaction with it. It 
          was like mimicking me and bouncing around, kind of over-exaggerating my movements. It was 
          very playful. The energy coming off this guy was so fun and playful.”</p>

          <p>The met with Peter a few days later and told him what happened. Peter just smiled and 
          showed no surprise. Peter promised to meet them again, but suddenly he disappeared from 
          their lives. All the boys, but especially Carter, were devastated. Peter was like a long-
          lost friend, or an enlightened Master, and now he was gone.</p>

          <p>A few weeks later, Carter and his friends had a dramatic UFO sighting over Rosedale. 
          Then, one of Carter’s friends saw Peter at a fast-food restaurant in Toronto, and tried 
          to get up and talk to him but found himself unable to move until Peter left.</p>

          <p>Carter was profoundly affected by his meetings with Peter. His sense of spirituality 
          became stronger. He began to communicate telepathically with Peter. Carter grew up, 
          searching out the works of spiritual leaders, but none held a candle to what he learned 
          from Peter. Carter traveled the world, and ended up in Hawaii where he built an off-grid 
          home and met his wife. One evening in the middle of the night, the house filled with 
          unexplained white light. Both Carter and his girlfriend had strange memories of being 
          onboard a craft. When they woke up the next morning, they found a strange implant in the 
          same location on their arms.</p>

          <p>They moved back to the mainland and continued to have UFO sightings. Carter thought 
          about Peter daily, and often wished that he would see him again one day. But he never 
          did. He looked back on those few incredible meetings with Peter and wondered, who was 
          this man, an angel, a spirit guide, an extraterrestrial? It remains a mystery, but today, 
          now in his late sixties, Carter will never forget how his life changed forever when Peter 
          came into his life.</p>

          <h5>Mar 8, 2024 (0:50:34)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There is a misconception in the field of ufology that no 
          astronomers have seen UFOs. But the truth is exactly the opposite. In fact, there is 
          a long list of high-profile astronomers who have had incredible UFO sightings. In 
          <b>1952</b>, Blue Book astronomy expert, J. Allen Hynek held a conference with 
          astronomers. “Over forty astronomers were interviewed,” he said, “of which five had 
          made sightings of one sort or another. This is a higher percentage than among the 
          populace at large.” Researcher Alejandro Rojas, writes “Often people will ask me, ‘If 
          there are so many UFOs, why aren’t astronomers seeing them?’ They are! In fact, 
          astronomers have been some of the most influential advocates for the serious study of 
          UFOs.” This video presents more than a dozen cases of astronomers who have seen UFOs.</p>

          <p>In <b>March of 1676</b>, Edmund Halley (the discover of Halley’s comet) observed 
          a “vast body apparently bigger than the moon,” which he estimates was 40 miles high, 
          moving in excess of 9000 mph. He had other sightings of unexplained lights in the sky 
          and on the moon, and on March 6, 1716, saw a strange UFO which remained in the sky for 
          2 full hours.</p>

          <p>In <b>1783</b>, Sir William Herschel (discover of Uranus and several moons) 
          observed several unexplained lights on the moon. And again on <b>October 2, 1790</b>, 
          he saw more unexplained lights. On several occasions he reported seeing UFOs in the 
          sky which he described variously as, “round…oval…and disc-shaped.”</p>

          <p>On <b>April 12, 1879</b>, astronomer Henry Harrison observed a strange object in 
          the skies over New York City which remained in view for three hours. Unknown to him, 
          another astronomer Spencer J. Devoe saw the same object. Researcher Morris K Jessup 
          triangulated the two observations and calculated that the object was a half-mile wide.</p>

          <p>On <b>July 10, 1947</b>, leading astronomer Lincoln Lapaz was driving through New 
          Mexico when he and his family saw an elliptical-shaped object high in the clouds. He 
          estimated that the object was 160 feet long, 65 feet wide. It was silent and appeared 
          “self-luminous” against the dark clouds.</p>

          <p>On <b>August 20, 1949</b>, Clyde Tombaugh (discoverer of Pluto) was with his family 
          in New Mexico when they all saw a “curious bright object” move across the sky and 
          darting off. Says Tombaugh, “This remarkably sudden ascent thoroughly convinced me that 
          we were dealing with an absolute novel airborne device.”</p>

          <p>On <b>February 16, 1950</b>, Dr Charles Shane of the Lick Observatory in Santa Clara, 
          CA saw a “queer object” which he said was “moving unusually swiftly.” He said, “I call 
          this celestial phenomenon one of the most unusual objects sighted in the sky for a long 
          time.”</p>

          <p>On <b>May 20, 1950</b>, Seymour Hess was at Lowell Observatory in Arizona when he saw 
          a glowing and “extremely prominent” object move at 200 miles per hour across the sky and 
          into a cloudbank, against the wind. He estimates the object was about five feet wide.</p>

          <p>On <b>August 3, 1951</b>, Walter Webb of Hayden Planetarium in Boston, Massachusetts 
          saw a glowing object move across the sky in a weird wave-like pattern. Says Webb, “No 
          known object I could think of followed a path like that…my UFO appeared to be a bright, 
          glowing object moving in a regular, wavy pattern.”</p>

          <p>On <b>January 25, 1954</b>, astronomer Robert D Schaldach described his observation 
          of a “yellow-white” pulsating light move across the sky at White Sands, New Mexico. 
          Another military officer observed the object. They reported it to Project Blue Book 
          saying that the object “was not any kind of meteor.” Blue Book did no investigation, 
          but called the object “astronomical…meteor.”</p>

          <p>On <b>June 11, 1954</b>, Percy Wilkins was flying over the east coast of the US when 
          he saw two objects that “looked exactly like polished metal plates reflecting in the 
          sunlight.” He concluded that the objects were likely "built, piloted, and controlled by 
          intelligences that surpass that of humans.”</p>

          <p>On <b>November 1, 1955</b>, Frank Halstead of Darling Observatory in Duluth, Minnesota 
          was on a train with his wife in Death Valley, California when they observed two UFOs. 
          Says Halstead, “both objects were very shiny, we noticed. But this second one was 
          definitely disc-shaped… The time is long overdue for accepting the presence of these 
          things.”</p>

          <p>Jacques Vallee needs no introduction and is a towering figure in the UFO field. In 
          <b>1961</b>, he was at the Paris Observatory in France and tracked an unexplained object. 
          Says Vallee, “I thought, here we are at a renowned institution seeing something we can’t 
          explain, and destroying data for fear of ridicule.”</p>

          <p>As can be seen astronomers all across the world have been seeing UFOs for a very long 
          time. Even Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb says, “UFOs should be the subject of mainstream 
          inquiry. Science must bring clarity.” The time for skepticism is over. The evidence for 
          UFOs is conclusive. We are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO encounters are by their very nature, unusual, but some 
          cases are weirder than others. This is especially true with close-up encounters with 
          humanoids. UFO contact is so much more than just being picked up and examined. UFOs and 
          ETs interact with people in many strange ways. This video presents ten cases from all 
          over the world involving humanoid encounters with high strangeness. Cases from the 
          <b>1950s</b> to the <b>2000s</b>. Cases with compelling physical evidence. Cases that 
          have much to teach us about the ET agenda.</p>
          
          <p><b>IF THERE ARE ANY MORE WARS</b>. On <b>Aug 30, 1955</b>, 21-year-old David Ankenbrandt 
          drove near his home in Mulberry Corners, Ohio when a UFO landed nearby. Going to investigate, 
          he was confronted by a human-looking ET who had an urgent mission for David. When David 
          explained that he was unable to perform this mission, the ETs insisted. Two days later, they 
          returned.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD</b>. On the <b>evening of Sep 25, 1957</b>, Sam Aellig 
          and his wife were shocked when a UFO hovered over their home in Alliance, Ohio. Suddenly, 
          a dozen 7-foot-tall ETs walked out of the cornfield and stood in front of their home. One 
          of the beings began to approach. Mrs. Aellig hid under the bed with their baby while Sam 
          stood guard at the front door to see what would happen next.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN IN THE ANTARCTIC</b>. On <b>Dec 11, 1958</b>, AQ1 Navy officer Roger D. 
          Benson was transporting waste from the base at McMurdo Sound in Antarctica when he came 
          upon a landed UFO. Beneath it stood a short humanoid with a huge head. Realizing he was 
          seeing something unusual, he radioed the base in a panic. His message was never received. 
          Unknown to him, the base was being plagued by UFO activity.</p>

          <p><b>THE GIANT ON THE BEACH</b>. One <b>evening in Sep 1961</b>, PHD student Stan Suban 
          was taking a walk along the beach near Fort Tilden, New York when he noticed a group of 
          very tall skin divers standing in a row on the beach. Then he saw a 7-foot-tall figure 
          even more close-by and realized with a shock that it wasn’t human. He hid and watched for 
          several minutes, but fled the scene in fear.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS IN THE BACKYARD</b>. On the <b>evening of Aug 28, 1963</b>, 12-year-old 
          Fernando Sagrada, his brother Ronaldo (9,) and their friend Jose (9,) were stunned to 
          see a UFO hovering over their backyard. Inside they saw four tall humanoids. Suddenly 
          one came down in a beam of light and approached the boys. Fernando tried to throw a 
          brick at the figure, but it struck him with a beam of light. The figure spoke and then 
          returned to the craft.</p>

          <p><b>THE SJAELLANDS ODDE UFO & HUMANOIDS</b>. On <b>Jan 18, 1967</b>, three boys saw a 
          UFO moving overhead near their homes in Sjaellands Odde, Denmark. Two ran home, but 
          7-year-old Jesper Andersen stayed and observed eight very short humanoids emerge from 
          the bottom of the craft in a little gondola. They moved closer to him, then waved and 
          smiled at him before moving off.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN THE WINDOW</b>. Around <b>dusk on Apr 18, 1971</b>, engaged couple 
          Dennis D. and Marion L. were driving on the outskirts of rural Evans City, Pennsylvania 
          when Marion saw a UFO with and two 10-foot-tall humanoids peering out one of the 
          portholes. They drove closer and came upon the craft landed in a field. They watched it 
          for twenty minutes, then decided it was best if they departed the area.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN ON THE HAM RADIO</b>. On the <b>evening of Aug 12, 1976</b>, David L Dobbs 
          was monitoring his ham radio as he drove outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. Suddenly an odd 
          melodious voice came on the radio and instructed him to drive to a certain location. 
          Upon arriving, David was confronted by a strange humanoid who linked up with him 
          telepathically and downloaded volumes of information into his mind.</p>
          
          <p><b>WHY DO YOU HATE?</b> On the <b>evening of Nov 1, 1980</b>, an anonymous police 
          officer was on routine patrol near Lucky Point, Indiana, an area of known UFO activity. 
          Looking up, he saw a triangular craft at low altitude. Through one of the windows, he 
          saw five big-headed humanoids. Then he heard a telepathic voice asking him, “Why do you 
          hate?” The officer was shocked and had a quick response to the question.</p>
          
          <p><b>UFO IN THE SUBURBS</b>. Around 2am on Feb 29, 2008, an anonymous man was walking 
          home in the small but crowded suburb of Coogee, in Sydney Australia when he saw something 
          he could hardly believe, a car-sized levitating sphere with a short humanoid looking out 
          at him. The witness hid in fear, watched for five minutes as the craft flew away. 
          Afterwards, a discolored spot was easily visible on the road.</p>
          
          <p>These ten cases reveal UFOs and ETs that behave in very unusual ways. And yet, they 
          are just a tiny sampling of the huge number of cases. With so many cases from all over 
          the world, coming from multiple witnesses, stretching back decades to the current day, 
          supported by various forms of evidence, the time for ridicule and disbelief is over. We 
          are being visited by extraterrestrials. We have much to learn from  cases like these.</p>

          <h5>Feb 23, 2024 (1:17:00)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the UFO phenomenon is 
          when people have direct face-to-face contact with humanoids. Sightings are undeniably 
          interesting and add to our knowledge of the subject. But humanoid encounters are so 
          close-up that they allow little chance for misperception. They also contain a lot more 
          information. There are far more cases than most people realize. This video presents ten 
          cases from across the world involving direct contact with humanoids of all kinds.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE HUMAN ETS</b>. On the <b>morning of Jul 20, 1965</b>, milkman Ramon Eduardo 
          Pereyra was making deliveries in Quilmes, Argentina when he saw a strange craft land 
          nearby. He exited his vehicle and hiked to the location. To his shock, he came upon a 
          small craft with a man inside. Suddenly another man approached, ignored Ramon, entered 
          the craft, which promptly took off.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE INVASION OF AVEYRON</b>. Starting around <b>Jun of 1966</b>, residents of a 
          farmhouse in Aveyron, France began seeing glowing white spheres on their property. They 
          also saw a tall cylindrical object landed nearby. The encounters continued, and on 
          <b>Jan 11, 1967</b>, one member of the family chased a white sphere in his car, and came 
          upon the cylindrical object which took off. Then he saw a saucer-shaped craft with two 
          humanoids inside. The encounter affected him profoundly.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE LITTLE GREEN SPACE PENGUINS</b>. On the <b>morning of Feb 14, 1967</b>, Claude Edwards 
          woke up to feed the cows on his farm in Tuscumbia, MO when he saw a saucer-shaped craft landed 
          a short distance away. Small gray-green figures scurried around beneath it. As he approached, 
          they went inside the craft. He threw a couple of rocks at it, but they hit some kind of 
          forcefield. Shortly later, the craft took off, leaving behind strange landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>THEY WERE NOT BEINGS LIKE US</b>. On the <b>evening of Apr 16, 1974</b>, Mauro Bellingeri 
          and his wife, Carla, were returning to their home in Casale, Italy when a saucer swooped down 
          and hovered over their car. Looking up, they were amazed to see three or four humanoids in an 
          illuminated transparent dome on top of the craft. When the figures turned to look at them, 
          Carla fled in fear. Mauro watched as the UFO suddenly took off at high speed.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN THE ROAD</b>. Trucker Maximiliano of Salamanca Spain never believed in 
          UFOs. But all that changed on the <b>night of Mar 21, 1974</b> when he came upon a landed 
          UFO blocking the road. Another hovered overhead. As he watched, two humanoids emerged and 
          pointed at him, then returned to their craft, which took off. He drove off in a panic. The 
          next night he had another encounter along the same stretch of road. This time, the humanoids 
          chased him.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS ON TOP OF THE HOSPITAL</b>. On the <b>night of May 7, 1974</b>, Margaret K Roffe 
          (a nurse’s aid) stepped out of the Veteran’s Hospital in Coatesville, PA where she worked 
          when she saw a small silver saucer landing on the roof of the hospital. Next, three bald, 
          big-headed, gray figures emerged. One looked down at her, and seeing her, they scrambled back 
          into their craft, which took off at high speed.</p>

          <p><b>THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME</b>. On the <b>evening of Feb 24, 1977</b>, friends Lothar 
          Schafler and Rudi Grutsch observed two glowing craft at Langenargen, Germany. The craft 
          disappeared, but when they returned home, the UFOs came back, now much closer. Rudi was 
          inside his home, but Lothar was outside when the craft shone down a beam of light. Suddenly 
          he saw two small humanoids right next to him. He panicked and broke a window to get inside. 
          He thinks he had missing time.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT</b>. One <b>night in May 1977</b>, an anonymous man was 
          fishing along the Amose River in Amosen, Denmark when a saucer-shaped craft zoomed toward him 
          and hovered overhead. He was amazed to see humanoid figures looking down at him. Then the 
          craft sent down a cone-shaped beam of light, and the witness observed another humanoid in the 
          beam. </p>
          
          <p><b>THREE DARK FIGURES</b>. While driving home from the hospital in Temperanceville, VA, 
          Marlene LaRose (a nurse) came upon a hovering craft along a remote highway near her home. 
          Looking up, she saw three humanoid figures looking down at her. The craft was close enough 
          that her headlights shone directly on it. She watched it for seven minutes after which it 
          moved forward over her car and off into the distance.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE JOSZA UFO LANDINGS</b>. Throughout <b>1986</b>, many people driving along a small 
          stretch of road outside of Josza, Hungary reported seeing UFOs, being followed, and watching 
          UFOs land in the fields. Then, on <b>Jan 9, 1987</b>, a highway worker came upon a landed craft 
          and three short humanoids. One stood in a doorway, while the other two stood beneath the craft. 
          The witness fled in fear. Meanwhile, the encounters continued.</p>
          
          <p>These ten cases represent just a tiny fraction of the actual number of humanoid encounters 
          taking place across our planet. With so many reported cases, it is undeniable that Earth is 
          being visited by ETs of all kinds. It’s time for humanity to wake up to the fact that we are 
          not alone.</p>

          TRUE ENCOUNTERS</a></h2>

          <h5>Feb 16, 2024 (1:12:47)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">ETs have been visiting humans for a very long time. Cases 
          reach back hundreds of years and come from all over the world. Here is a collection of 
          twelve accounts of humanoids of all different kinds from <b>1922 to 2023</b>. Most of the 
          cases involve multiple witnesses. Several involve physical evidence. The truth can no 
          longer be denied. Earth appears to be just one countless inhabited planets in our universe. 
          The evidence speaks for itself.</p>

          <p><b>TWENTY ALIENS</b>. In the <b>summer of 1922</b>, Irma Hinz and her boyfriend William 
          O’Brien were walking home from a movie in Detroit, MI when they saw a disc-shaped object 
          descend to treetop level and hover over a nearby tree. Staring down at them through a 
          series of portholes were at least twenty bald figures with close-set eyes.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS</b>. In the <b>summer of 1933</b>, three people drove to 
          Tobin Lake in Nipawan, Saskatchewan, Canada to investigate the strange lights people had 
          been seeing in the area. To their shock, they came upon a landed craft and a dozen 
          humanoid figures. The humanoids appeared to be working on repairing the craft.</p>

          <p><b>AN UNINVITED GUEST</b>. As investigated by researcher Klas Svahn, on the <b>night 
          of May 18, 1946</b>, beekeeper, Gosta Carlsson came upon a landed UFO outside of 
          Skalderviksstranden, Sweden. Several male and female human-looking figures surrounded 
          the craft. Gosta approached as close as he could, and watched until they returned inside 
          and the craft departed. Later, he experienced telepathic contact with the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>THE LAUGHING ALIEN</b>. On the <b>afternoon of Aug 14, 1951</b>, a farmer approached 
          a cemetery near his home town of Voghenza, Italy and saw a landed craft and six 4-foot-tall 
          humanoids standing next to it. They wore shiny white jumpsuits and fishbowl helmets, and 
          had monkey-like faces. One of them shot him with a ray of light. They then retreated into 
          the craft, which took off, leaving behind strange landing traces.

          <p><b>THE GLOWING GREEN MEN</b>. It was a <b>stormy night in 1965</b>, as a young couple 
          drove their car along the A6 highway in Cumbria, England. Pulling over to rest, they noticed 
          a glowing red dome-shaped object landed behind a brick wall. Standing in front of the wall 
          were three humanoids glowing with a weird green color. They sped away in a panic.</p>

          <p><b>A BIGFOOT-UFO ENCOUNTER</b>. Around <b>10am, on Feb 22, 1976</b>, the Hegele family 
          was driving along Interstate 15 outside of Great Falls, Montana when they saw a 7-foot-tall 
          humanoid next to the highway. The father, Leonard Hegele stopped the car and pursued the 
          creature, Then he saw a strange craft behind the creature. Soon other reports came in of 
          Bigfoot-like creatures in the area.</p>

          <p><b>THE ROBOT AND THE MONK</b>. On the <b>afternoon of Jul 11, 1978</b>, two young boys 
          were climbing trees near their homes in Ibiza, Spain when they were chased by a robot-like 
          humanoid. Fleeing the area, they saw another strange humanoid wearing monk’s robes. They 
          also saw a landed saucer. But then it released a blue orb which came at them. They ran 
          home, with the blue orb following them most of the way.</p>

          <p><b>HE WAS NOT HUMAN</b>. On the <b>night of Feb 13, 1980</b>, a farmer went to check 
          on his new farm-field outside of Rafaela, Argentina. As a strange silence settled around 
          him, he saw a tall humanoid dressed in a white astronaut suit using a hose-like device to 
          draw water from the river. The figure floated towards him, and moved through a thick hedge 
          of thorn bushes. The bushes seemed to part before the figure.</p>

          <p><b>THE CHILD-LIKE ETS</b>. At <b>noon on Dec 12, 1997</b>, Janko Vrancic came upon a 
          landed UFO and child-like humanoids in a field next to his farm outside Sibenik, Croatia. 
          Having heard about aliens on TV, he approached them and offered them some of his lunch. 
          They told him they weren’t hungry, then climbed into their craft, which quickly departed.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO IN THE BLACK CLOUD</b>. On <b>Sep 28, 2008</b>, newlyweds Jim and Linda were 
          enjoying a walk along the beach at Perdido Key, FL. Looking up, they noticed a weird black 
          cloud accelerating towards them. Then it stopped about 150 feet overhead and began to light 
          up. A craft appeared in the cloud, and in one of the portholes, he saw an alien staring down 
          at him.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE SKINNY GRAY</b>. On the night of <b>Jun 6, 2018</b>, four people were in the woods 
          outside of Siletz, OR. Suddenly one of them, a 12-year-old girl saw a skinny little gray 
          staring at her from 100 feet away. She called out to the others, who didn’t see it. But over 
          the next few minutes, it appeared two more times, but only to the girl.</p>
          
          <p><b>A STARING CONTEST WITH AN ET</b>. Around <b>4am on Jun 1, 2023</b>, two garbage men 
          were on their route near Mifflin, OH when they saw a tall, thin, gray-skinned skinny figure 
          with large dark eyes staring at them from the woods a short distance away. One of the men 
          walked towards it, and the figure bounded off into the trees and disappeared.</p>
          
          <p>These cases are just a tiny sample of the huge number of humanoid cases on record. There 
          are too many cases to ignore. ETs are visiting our planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials onboard a UFO! 
          There’s no experience quite like it. It’s the ultimate UFO encounter. An onboard 
          experience takes a person right into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon, answering 
          many of the questions surrounding this subject. And there are so many cases! This video 
          presents five strange and fascinating accounts of people who were taken onboard an ET 
          craft and met extraterrestrials face-to-face. Want to know the ET agenda on our planet? 
          The answers are here!</p>
          
          <p><b>LORD MOUNTBATTEN’S BRICKLAYER</b>. On <b>Feb 23, 1956</b>, Frederick S Briggs, a 
          former Army officer, was riding his bike on the estate of Lord Mountbatten of Burma in 
          Romsey, England when he saw a flying saucer hovering overhead. He found himself unable to 
          move as a platform holding a human-looking figure descended from the bottom of the craft. 
          Upon reaching the ground, the ET apparently saw Frederick, and the platform retracted back 
          into the craft, which flew off. But the next day, the ET was back. And this time, Frederick 
          had a face-to-face meeting, and was taken onboard the craft. Frederick says the craft took 
          him on a trip around the world before returning him to the Mountbatten’s estate. It was an 
          encounter he would keep secret for a long time.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO PROPHET</b>. Born in <b>1898</b> in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Benjamin Solari 
          Parravicini displayed psychic talents from an early age. He told his parents that he was 
          having contact with angels, fairies and other supernatural beings. He grew up to become a 
          talented artist, and began to make prophetic drawings predicting many momentous world events. 
          His predictions turned out to be uncannily accurate, and his fame grew quickly. Then, on the 
          <b>evening of Jun 4, 1968</b>, a few months before his 70th birthday, Benjamin was walking 
          through downtown Buenos Aires when he met a human-looking ET who took him onboard a craft, 
          which proceeded to circle the planet. The ETs told Benjamin that they were protecting the 
          world from catastrophe, and that it was important that he preach love to all humanity.</p>

          <p><b>TAKEN ONBOARD</b>. Jan Wolski was a simple farmer from the small village of Emilcin, 
          Poland when, on the <b>morning of May 19, 1978</b>, two short, green-skinned figures in 
          dark jumpsuits jumped on his horse-drawn wagon and led him to a UFO. Jan was invited 
          onboard where he underwent a physical exam. The ETs were kind and gentle, he said, and 
          they offered Jan some strange alien food, but he declined. While onboard, he noticed a 
          small group of crows which the ETs had evidently collected from Earth. After the short 
          meeting, Jan was returned to his wagon. He rushed home and told his family. News of his 
          encounter spread fast, and soon others in town reported that they too had seen the craft. 
          Investigators arrived and after investigating the case, declared it genuine. It soon 
          became one of Poland’s most famous UFO cases.</p>

          <p><b>THEY NEED ME</b>. Mark James of Stone Mountain, Georgia was 18-years old when, on 
          the <b>night of Jun 23, 1981</b>, he had his first encounter with gray aliens. He and his 
          girlfriend, Linda, had pulled off the road in a rural area when a brilliant light appeared 
          overhead, followed by a period of missing time. Years later, under hypnosis, Mark recalled 
          that he and Linda were pulled onboard the craft. Mark was taken to a large round room where 
          he saw dozens of other people, some waiting in little booths, while others were placed on 
          tables being examined by grays. Soon Mark was examined, and afterward, a tall gray he 
          described as kind and loving warned him of future catastrophes, such as a disease called 
          Ebola, and a possible nuclear attack on the city of Atlanta. He was also shown his future 
          wife and child. Mark was then returned with Linda back to his car with almost no memory of 
          the event. Soon, more encounters would occur.</p>

          <p><b>I COULDN’T GET OUT</b>. On the <b>evening of June 14, 1986</b>, Bete Rodrigues and 
          her cousin Debora were returning from a dance club near their home in Sao Paolo, Brazil 
          when a UFO began to pace their bus. It darted away, but as the two walked home, the UFO 
          returned, following them. By the time they arrived home, the two had experienced a period 
          of missing time. Afterwards, they had dreams and flashbacks of being examined by ETs 
          onboard a craft. Five years later, they sought hypnosis and learned that both had been 
          pulled onboard a craft. They were taken into different rooms where both underwent a 
          strange physical examination. Bete believes she was implanted by the ETs. Bete also 
          recalled other encounters from her childhood.</p>

          <p>These five amazing onboard UFO encounters reveal the many ET agendas, such as studying 
          human physiology, providing warnings about our future, and informing people about the ET 
          presence on our planet. These cases show that there is a wide variety of ET types, and that 
          an encounter can occur to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The truth can no longer be denied. 
          We are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In the presence of extraterrestrials! There is no experience 
          quite like it. Seeing a UFO is interesting, but having a face-to-face interaction with 
          an ET brings things to a whole new level. And it happens more often than you might 
          think. This video presents ten extensive encounters in which people have been in the 
          presence of ETs. These cases come from all over the world, involve a wide variety of 
          witnesses and span six decades. Many have multiple witnesses and physical evidence.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO LIKE A SILVER BULLET</b>. One day in <b>Aug 1956</b>, a young boy, “CS,” 
          played football with his friends in Badajoz, Spain. Suddenly a loud roar filled the 
          sky, and looking up, they saw a silver, bullet-shaped object zoom towards them at 
          fantastic acceleration, slow down, and then stop. And inside they saw two figures. 
          About 30 people ran forward, gesturing for the UFO to land. The ETs waved back, but 
          then flew away.</p>

          <p><b>US OR THEM?</b> One <b>evening in autumn of 1965</b>, Keith Meiers (a farmer) 
          looked out the window of his farmhouse in Ross, ND and saw a landed flying saucer in 
          his field. Inside, through a transparent dome, he saw two human-looking figures. He 
          used the telescope on his rifle to get a closer look, until the craft silently 
          departed. The next day, he went to the spot and saw three depressions in the field. 
          Was it alien or military?</p>

          <p><b>YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW THE WORLD</b>. On <b>Jul 2, 1968</b>, Oscar Iriart (age 
          14) was horseback riding near his home in Sierra Chica, Argentina when he saw two 
          odd-looking human figures. A small flying saucer sat on the ground behind them. They 
          told Oscar that later they would take him for a ride. They gave him a note and returned 
          to their craft, which took off, leaving three holes in the field. Later that night, the 
          UFO returned.</p>

          <p><b>EVERYTHING IS GOD</b>. One <b>night in Jul 1968</b>, Walter Rizzi was driving 
          through the Dolomite Mountains of Italy when he came upon a landed craft. Walking up 
          to it, he saw a short humanoid figure who held a long conversation with Walter about 
          their craft, themselves, their home-world, their agenda, the meaning of God, and even 
          future Earth prophecies. Walter begged them to take him with them, but they refused.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOIDS IN THE TIJUCA FOREST</b>. In <b>Aug 24, 1974</b>, Regina Conceiacao and 
          four friends stood in front of a home in Alto da Boa Vista, Brazil. Suddenly, they saw 
          two figures, clad in shimmering golden space suits, floating two feet above the road 
          and moving towards them. They fled in fear. Only days earlier, numerous people had seen 
          floating humanoids in the Tijuca Forest which surrounds the area.</p>

          <p><b>“I CAN’T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND”</b> One <b>night in Jul 1975</b>, Frank Slotta and 
          his family drove near their home in Edgewater, British Columbia, Canada and saw a strange 
          light hovering by the road. Later, Frank, now alone, returned along the same road and saw 
          the light again, only this time he saw it was a craft, with occupants visible inside. He 
          became entranced. The next thing he knew, almost two hours had passed.</p>

          <p><b>I DIDN’T DARE SAY ANYTHING</b>. As 10-year-old Jean-Claude Silvente returned to his 
          home in Domene, France on the <b>night of Jan 5, 1976</b>, he was shocked to see a dome-
          shaped craft land next to him. A door opened and out stepped a tall, blond-haired human-
          looking figure who chased Jean-Claude. He ran home in fear. The next day he saw the figure 
          again. Soon, many people in the area saw UFOs and aliens.</p>
 
          <p><b>I SAW A FIGURE!</b> On the <b>night of Jan 19, 1976</b>, Kay Peterson and Vi Camp 
          stepped out of their home in Heislerville, NJ and saw a huge UFO hovering nearby. They 
          called out the neighbors and all of them watched as the craft moved overhead and stopped. 
          One of the witnesses saw a humanoid inside a clear part of the craft. The craft left, but 
          people all over the area began reporting UFOs, including the police.</p>

          <p><b>THE BRANCEPETH LEPRECHAUN</b>. At <b>7:10 am, on Jan 2, 1995</b>, Diana Newton 
          drove along the A690 Road in Brancepeth when she noticed a short little man walking 
          alongside the shoulder. Slowing down, she was shocked to see that he was yellow in 
          color and had large dark eyes and no hair. He bobbed along in a strange bouncing gait. 
          Frightened, she took off. Weirdly, the experience left her mind for a full day.</p>

          <p><b>UNABLE TO MOVE</b>. One night in Nov 2008, Segundo Godoy Lopez was working on top 
          of a building in downtown Santiago, Chile when he saw a strange aircraft approach. Next, 
          it came to within 30 feet of him, and he could see two short, bald, gray figures inside 
          staring directly at him. He tried to alert his co-workers but found himself paralyzed. 
          Finally, the UFO moved away. But Segundo would never be the same.</p>

          <p>These ten fascinating cases show that there are many types of ETs visiting our 
          planet, and that a close encounter can happen to anyone, perhaps when they least 
          expect it. They show how truly strange a UFO encounter can be, and that being in the 
          presence of ETs is something that affects a person profoundly for the rest of their 
          lives.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It represents the heart of the UFO phenomenon and is the most 
          extensive and interesting of all encounters: close encounters of the fourth kind, cases 
          of people who have been taken onboard a craft. Experiencers like these are far more common 
          than most people realize. They occur all over the world, and can happen to anyone, anywhere, 
          anytime. Cases like these contain the most information about the many different types of 
          extraterrestrials visiting our planet, and answer the many questions surrounding this 
          subject. This video presents five little-known cases of close encounters of the fourth 
          kind, each of which provides a tantalizing glimpse into the high strangeness of UFO contact.</p>

          <p><b>“I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.”</b> On the <b>night of May 15, 1951</b>, “John,” an army 
          officer was walking to his home north of Salzburg, Austria when a strange man wearing a 
          glass helmet approached him. John found himself paralyzed as the man strapped an odd device 
          to John’s chest and floated him into a craft landed nearby. Suddenly, the craft zoomed 
          upwards. John was shocked to watch the Earth recede into the distance. Moments later, a 
          beautiful landscape appeared before him, filled with lush red fields, blue canals, and 
          tall spires. The craft landed at a saucer-port, the being exited, and John saw many other 
          craft around him, some with other humans inside. Moments later, the ET returned. They took 
          off and John was returned to Earth. For decades he told no one. But growing older, he 
          finally decided it was time to talk.</p>

          <p><b>EXAMINED BY ROBOTS</b>. In the <b>early morning hours of Sep 29, 1974</b>, bus-
          driver Antonio La Rubia was walking to his place of employment in Paciencia, Brazil 
          and came upon a massive craft sitting in a field. Suddenly unable to move, he was 
          dragged onboard the craft by two robotic figures. Onboard, he was surrounded by 
          dozens of the strange beings, who placed him in a glass-like, bell-jar shaped 
          container. They proceeded to show him a series of bizarre images, some involving 
          apparent future events. They took a blood sample and then dropped him off two miles 
          from the original location. Following the encounter, Antonio suffered fever, extreme 
          thirst, loss of appetite, rash, swelling, body pain, nausea, diarrhea and had to be 
          hospitalized. Later it was discovered that another person in the area saw a UFO on 
          the same night.</p>

          <p><b>“I DID NOT DARE TALK ABOUT IT.”</b> At <b>1:30 am, on Jun 11, 1976</b>, Helene 
          Giuliana was driving home near Bourg-de-Peage, France when her car began to slow down 
          by itself, the engine faltered, then the headlights went out and the car rolled to a 
          stop. Helene was alarmed to see a brilliant glowing object landed on the road ahead. 
          She locked her car-doors and covered her eyes. Suddenly the object was gone. She drove 
          home, only to discover she had arrived two hours later than she should have. Later, she 
          agreed to undergo hypnotic regression, and recalled being taken from her car by short 
          dwarf-like beings who pulled her into the craft, put her on a steel table and examined 
          her. She was returned to her car with no memory of the event.</p>

          <p><b>WHAT WOULD YOU WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BEFORE YOU DIE?</b> In <b>Jun 
          of 1976</b>, Rick A. Hale’s life changed forever. He was 21 years old, and decided to 
          mentally call out for UFO contact. A few days later, while driving along the I-90 Freeway 
          near Indian John Hill, Washington that he pulled off the freeway onto a rural road and saw 
          three strange beings in white suits and helmets. Even though he had been hoping for 
          contact, he panicked and drove off. However, that night he realized he was missing two 
          hours. Years later, under hypnosis, he recalled being taken onboard a craft where he 
          encountered human-looking ETs, grays, and a wolf-like humanoid. He held a long conversation 
          with them which changed the way he viewed everything.</p>

          <p><b>THEY ARE REAL NICE</b>. “Peter,” a 10-year-old from Georgia reports having contact 
          with gray-like beings since age 4 or 5, starting in the <b>mid-1980s</b>. When onboard, 
          Peter reports that he is almost always taken to a library where the ETs have a bunch of 
          books about Earth, the environment and nature.  On a few occasions, he’s given weird ET 
          puzzle-games and the ETs watch while he tries to solve them. Peter’s onboard encounters 
          usually last for an hour or two, but he is almost always returned only minutes after 
          being taken. Peter says his contacts are benevolent and the ETs are very friendly, 
          though his mother, who is also an experiencer, is frightened by her own encounters. 
          Peter believes the ET agenda is all about trying to save the planet from destruction.</p>

          <p>These five close encounters of the fourth kind provide a small cross-section of what 
          appears to be hundreds of thousands if not millions of similar encounters taking place 
          all over the world. These cases have both amazing similarities and puzzling, unique 
          elements. But most importantly, they show that we are not alone in this universe, and 
          that ETs show a great interest in the people of Earth and in the planet itself.</p>

          TWELVE TRUE CASES</a></h2>

          <h5>Jan 19, 2024 (1:13:44)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It’s a pattern that researchers have recognized long ago: 
          UFOs seem to be attracted to water. Lakes, rivers, oceans…there are many cases where 
          UFOs are seen diving into the water, coming out of it, floating on the surface, and 
          affecting the water in unusual ways. Cases reach back decades and come from all over 
          the world. Some accounts involve UFOs sucking up the water itself! This video presents 
          twelve weird water UFO cases, each of which provides profound insights into UFOs and 
          their strange connection to water.</p>

          <p><b>USO WITH HUMANOIDS</b>. One day in <b>Aug 1914</b> as William Kiehl and other 
          witnesses saw an odd object floating in Georgian Bay at Lake Ontario, Canada. Shaped 
          like a bell-jar, he saw two humanoids holding a hose, sucking water from the bay. On 
          top of the object were 3 other figures. The UFO departed so quickly that one of the 
          little men clung to the outside of the craft.</p>

          <p><b>“IT WAS WATCHING US.”</b> When three people decided to take the ferry across Okanagan 
          Lake in British Columbia, Canada, in <b>Aug 1952</b>, they were awed to see a weird round 
          boat zoom toward them on the lake. As it arrived, it rose into the air, showing itself to 
          be a UFO. It hung there briefly, then moved back over the lake before darting off.</p>

          <p><b>UFO ORDEAL AT ORADELL</b>. Just before <b>8pm on Sep 15, 1962</b>, three boys were 
          shocked to see a UFO drop from the sky, plunge into the Oradell Reservoir in New Jersey, 
          and takeoff. Unknown to them, others saw the object. The next night, the UFO was back. 
          Soon, UFOs were being seen nightly, by hundreds of people. The UFO wave would garner 
          national headlines.</p>

          <p><b>THE PEROPAVA RIVER UFO CRASH</b>. On the <b>afternoon of Oct 31, 1963</b>, more 
          than 50 people observed a flying saucer lose control and plunge into the Peropava Rivera 
          in Iguape, Brazil. As the water frothed and bubbled, the Brazilian military arrived and 
          sent divers down to recover the craft. But after two weeks of searching, no evidence of 
          the UFO was ever found.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO FISH STORY?</b> One <b>evening in 1964</b>, a group of fishermen at the 
          Moraleda Channel in Castro, Chile were shocked to see a glowing man walk out of the 
          sea. After staring at them for a few moments, the strange figure walked back into the 
          ocean. They could still see a strange glow under the water. That’s when fish began to 
          fill their nets in unprecedented numbers.</p>

          <p><b>BEYOND MY POWER TO COMPREHEND</b>. On <b>Apr 9, 1970</b>, Max Krauss was taking a 
          walk near his home in Aufhofen, Germany when he saw a 2-foot-wide, transparent sphere 
          with spokes pacing him. The bizarre device hovered over a small stream and began sucking 
          up water through a pipe. Moments later, it departed. As an electrician Max was convinced 
          that he had seen something extraterrestrial.</p>

          <p><b>UFO DISPLAY OVER CHOLLA BAY</b>. On the <b>night of Nov 7, 1971</b>, Albert Formiller 
          walked along the beach at Cholla Bay, Mexico when a saucer-shaped craft appeared and sent 
          down a beam of light nearly a half-mile wide onto the surface of the water. The craft 
          remained for 20 minutes before slowly moving off. Unknown to Albert, many other people saw 
          the strange display.</p>

          <p><b>“MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE.”</b> In <b>Jul 1973</b>, “Masaaki” worked as a night-guard 
          for a lumber company along the coast of Tomokomai, Japan. To his great fear, a UFO dropped 
          down and began sucking water out of the bay. At one point, it moved overhead and was close 
          enough that he could see strange humanoids inside.</p>

          <p><b>USO AT PITYILU ISLAND</b>. One <b>evening in the 1970s</b>, a missionary was 
          staying at tiny Pityilu Island near Papua, New Guinea when a UFO appeared. It hovered 
          for a few moments and then plunged into the shallow reefs offshore. A group of men sent 
          a boat out to investigate, but before they could arrive, the object was gone.</p>

          <p><b>FISHING FOR UFOS</b>. On the <b>evening of Jul 15, 1981</b>, 14-year-old, Carl E. 
          Moore was amazed to see a UFO drop from the sky and float on the water of a small lake 
          in Newberry, SC. As it hit the water, it sent up a cloud of steam. He watched it from 
          50 feet away, for three minutes before the craft darted away.</p>

          <p><b>“FOLLOW THAT UFO!”</b> One <b>night in August 1981</b>, a group of 5 witnesses 
          driving in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada followed a red, glowing object as it made a 
          controlled descent into Lake Ontario. Going to the shore, they saw two submarine-like 
          objects emerge in the same exact location. Although the witnesses waited for hours, the 
          UFO never emerged.</p>

          <p><b>“THIS WAS REAL SCARY.”</b> When a father and his two sons went fishing off the 
          coast of Seaforth, England, they were awestruck to see a fleet of five UFOs dive into 
          the Mersey Estuary. Shortly later, all five objects emerged from the sea and flew off. 
          Several other witnesses saw the whole thing.</p>

          <p>These twelve cases only skim the surface of the huge number of cases involving UFOs 
          and USOs. These cases show that the waters of our planet might be holding vast numbers 
          of extraterrestrial craft, hidden from sight. And they show beyond any reasonable doubt 
          that there is a strange connection between UFOs and water.</p>

          <h5>Jan 12, 2024 (1:20:27)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Encounters with extraordinary humanoids have occurred across 
          the planet for a long time. They involve all different types of extraterrestrials who 
          interact with a variety of witnesses in strange and unique ways. These cases are among 
          the most fascinating of all UFO encounters. They are not simple sightings, nor are they 
          cases that rely on hypnotic regression. The evidence to support these encounters is more 
          extensive than many people realize with landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, 
          animal reactions, medical effects and more. But most important, they provide a fascinating 
          glimpse into what lies beyond planet Earth.</p>

          <p><b>SMACKED BY AN ALIEN</b>. On <b>Jul 2, 1953</b>, 14-year-old Maximo Munoz Hernaiz 
          was guarding the cows on his family ranch in Villares Del Saz, Spain, when a UFO landed 
          behind him. Three short men came out and spoke to him in a strange language. Then one 
          of the ETs reached out and smacked him on the cheek. The ETs returned to the craft, 
          which took off. Later, strange landing traces were found.</p>

          <p><b>A HAIR-RAISING EXPERIENCE</b>. Around <b>10am one morning in Jun 1954</b>, a 
          farmer in Bengough, Saskatchewan, Canada heard a strange motor-sound approaching from 
          the air. Looking up, he was shocked to see a flying saucer with a large transparent 
          cockpit, and seated inside were two human-looking men. The craft passed overhead no 
          higher than 20 feet. It turned out, he was not the only witness.</p>

          <p><b>WHY NOT TO FIGHT AN ET</b>. At <b>2am on Nov 28, 1954</b>, Gustavo Gonzalez and 
          Jose Ponce were driving through Petare, Venezuela when they came upon a glowing spherical-
          shaped object blocking the road. A small, hairy humanoid approached. Gustavo grabbed the 
          strange being, only to be thrown to the ground. He tried to stab it with his knife. 
          Meanwhile, people all over the area were reporting UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>THE MOUNT AIRY ALIEN</b>. <b>Late one night in Jul 1968</b>, Mrs. Eggers was woken 
          in her home in Mt. Airy, NC by her dog begging to be let inside. Opening the door, she 
          saw a flying saucer hover at low level across the street. Inside it, a strange humanoid 
          looked down at her. The craft stayed for twenty minutes, during which time, there was a 
          local power failure. Afterward, the witness suffered weird medical effects.</p>

          <p><b>WHAT TRUE BEAUTY IS</b>. On the <b>morning of Oct 2, 1968</b>, Toribio Pereira was 
          on a construction job in Lins, Brazil when a dropped from the sky and landed right next 
          to him. Four handsome, human-looking figures wearing robes appeared. One of them struck 
          Toribio with a beam of light while the others examined the surroundings, took soil 
          samples, and departed. Later, Toribio had more encounters, and was apparently healed by 
          the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>THREE ALIENS ON HUDSON BEACH</b>. <b>Late one night in May 1971</b>, an anonymous 
          elderly lady was drinking tea in her home on Hudson’s Beach, in Waluku, New Zealand, and 
          looking out the window, saw three strange figures on the beach. She thought they might be 
          fisherman until they stepped on a silver-strip and were drawn into a reddish ball of 
          light, which promptly soared high into the sky and disappeared.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING WASN’T QUITE RIGHT</b>. On the <b>evening of May 3, 1973</b>, Sigrid 
          Karlson was walking her dog outside her home in Mantorp, Sweden, when she saw a red 
          ball of light in the sky. Returning home, she watched it with her son, Robert, from 
          the window. As it came closer, they both were amazed to see that it was a craft with 
          a transparent dome, and inside were two strange humanoids looking at them.</p>

          <p><b>TOUCHED BY AN ALIEN</b>. On <b>Feb 23, 1975</b>, two 7-year-old boys were roller-
          skating when they saw a UFO fly across the sky and land nearby. They ran up to it as a 
          door opened and a short figure came out. It walked up to one of the boys and touched 
          him on the shoulder. The boys were paralyzed in fear. Finally the ET returned into the 
          craft. The boys ran to tell their parents who also saw the craft as it departed.</p>

          <p><b>COME WITH US ON A JOURNEY</b>. Around <b>9pm on Jan 27, 1983</b>, Alan was walking 
          to a friend’s house in Bloxwich, England when he saw a UFO overhead. Moments later, two 
          strange human-looking figures wearing gray jumpsuits appeared ahead of him. As he walked 
          up to them, they said, “Come with us on a journey.” When Alan declined, and said he didn’t 
          want to leave his life, they became insistent.</p>

          <p><b>NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU</b>. On the <b>night of Feb 18, 1990</b>, a woman 
          was walking with her dog near Korbach, Germany. Suddenly her dog whimpered and refused 
          to move. A large glowing craft landed, and the dog ran away. The woman was struck by a 
          beam of light. Shortly later, two short humanoids walked up to her and told her. “Don’t 
          be afraid.” They ETs spoke to her and then departed.</p>

          <p>These ten cases have much to teach us about extraterrestrial contact. They show us 
          that many people all over the world are having these experiences, that contact often 
          contains high levels of strangeness, that ETs come in all shapes and sizes, that a UFO 
          experience can profoundly impact a witness, and much more!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While there are those who are skeptical that UFOs exist, 
          the truth is that the evidence for extraterrestrials is undeniable. Landing traces, 
          electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, physiological effects…the list goes 
          on. And when cases like these have multiple eyewitness testimonies, the evidence 
          cannot be ignored or explained away. This video presents five exceptional cases with 
          undeniable evidence.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDING AT SOUTH HILL, VIRGINIA</b>. On the <b>evening of April 21, 1967</b>, 
          Clifton Crowder was driving along Ferrell Road to his home in South Hill, Virginia when 
          he noticed a shiny silver craft landed on the street in front of him. As he flicked on 
          his high-beams, the craft belched a stream of flames and took off like a bullet straight 
          up. The craft was gone, but left behind was a huge burn-mark on the road, and four 
          evenly spaced holes gouged into the macadam surface. He went straight to the police 
          and reported the incident. Unknown to him, dozens of people in the area were reporting 
          UFOs flying around at treetop level, including police officers and firemen. UFO 
          researchers converged on the case and declared it genuine. Project Blue Book was 
          contacted and they were unable to identify the craft and labeled it unexplained, 
          Case#11677.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS AT IOWA FARM</b>. It was around <b>10:00 pm on August 6, 1971</b> when 
          Don Ede looked outside his home in Westgate, Iowa and saw a brilliant flash in the sky, 
          followed by a red-orange object which dropped down into his neighbor’s field. Unknown 
          to Don, Mike Potratz who lived a short distance away also noticed the flash and the 
          strange object. The next morning, both Don and Mike woke up early and went to 
          investigate the farm of John Bantz, where they had seen the object come down. 
          Together, joined by a member of the Bantz family, they found a 10-foot-wide circle 
          of burned vegetation, surrounded by four smaller circles situated evenly around the 
          circumference. Unknown to any of them, two other people were driving near the area 
          two hours before Don and Ede saw the UFO and were chased down the road by an unknown 
          object.</p>

          <p><b>THE COLBY, KANSAS UFO LANDING</b>. At <b>2:00 am, on August 19, 1972</b>, John 
          I. Calkins woke up to see UFOs swooping down over his home in Gem, Kansas. He 
          immediately called the local police in Colby, Kansas. Patrolman Paul Carter was sent 
          to investigate, but before he could get there, the police officer came upon a landed 
          UFO. He called for backup and his fellow officer, Dennis Brown arrived and watched 
          the craft take-off. He saw that the craft was heading for nearby Oakley, and called 
          their sheriff’s station. They came out and saw the UFO too. Meanwhile, they headed 
          to John Calkins’ home in Gem, and the UFOs were still there. Meanwhile, the Colby 
          police station was flooded with calls. The UFOs flew around all night long. It would 
          be an experience that convinced many people that UFOs are real.</p>

          <p><b>MISSING TIME IN PRINCE GEORGE</b>. At <b>4:10 am on January 5, 1977</b>, 17-year-old 
          Kirk Alore drove along Hwy 16 outside of Prince George, Canada. He noticed an oncoming 
          car, and at the same time, saw a strange red light zooming towards it. Suddenly, the 
          object approached him, and he realized it was a UFO. His body became numb as his car 
          radio filled with static, his headlights failed and the engine died. The last thing 
          he remembered was seeing the oncoming car come right at him, the UFO overhead, and 
          then slamming on his brakes. He fell unconscious and woke up to find himself sitting 
          in the passenger seat of his car. The other driver woke him up and told Kirk that he 
          himself had also had missing time and woke up outside his car. Kirk was sore for a 
          week, had a persistent headache, and his car battery was dead. Soon he would have 
          more experiences and this time, he had more witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>THE GREENFIELD UFO LANDING</b>. Around <b>7:00 pm on Nov 8, 1975</b>, Cathy Wilfong 
          and Cindy Bridges were at their farm in Greenfield, Indiana when the power kept 
          mysteriously going off. Two hours later, a huge UFO appeared over their soybean field. 
          Their dog barked wildly and they fled to their house and called the police. When the 
          police arrived, the UFOs had moved off into the distance, but were still visible. 
          Meanwhile, calls flooded into the station from people reporting the UFOs. The next 
          morning, Cathy and Cindy found a 44-foot-wide circle of crushed vegetation, tightly 
          woven and matted together. When they went public with their story, many other witnesses 
          stepped forward to report their own sightings in that area on that night.</p>

          <p>These five cases provide compelling, if not conclusive, evidence of UFO reality. Those 
          who remain skeptical of UFOs have simply not done their research. The evidence is there 
          for those who have the courage to examine it. These five cases are just the tiniest 
          percentage of the actual number of cases, the vast majority of which goes completely 
          unreported. The evidence speaks for itself. UFOs are real! We are not alone!</p>

          UFO ENCOUNTERS</a></h2>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Onboard a UFO! It’s the closest of all UFO encounters. It’s 
          the most extensive, and perhaps the most interesting. It also contains the most 
          information. In cases like these, the witness is not just seeing a UFO, they are 
          inside it, surrounded entirely by the UFO phenomenon. Onboard UFO encounters allow 
          little room for misperception. This video present five amazing onboard UFO experiences. 
          In each of these cases, the witnesses were not only taken inside a UFO, they had long 
          interactive conversations with the ETs themselves. These five cases come from all over 
          the world, span four decades and involve a wide variety of humanoids and compelling 
          physical evidence.</p>

          <p><b>A MESSAGE TO HUMANITY</b>. On the <b>night of Apr 10, 1962</b>, Mario Zuccala was 
          walking to his home in San Casciano, Italy when he felt a blast of air behind him. 
          Turning around he saw a 32-foot-wide flying saucer land nearby. Out stepped two short 
          humanoid figures covered from head to toe in shiny metallic suits. They grabbed Mario 
          and pulled him onboard the craft. Inside, he saw nothing but bright light. The ETs 
          told him that they have a message for all humanity, which they will give to him later. 
          Mario later had further encounters, but never revealed what the ETs told him.</p>

          <p><b>“WE ARE HERE TO HELP.”</b> On the <b>evening of Jun 23, 1967</b>, Paulo Coutinho 
          (age 17) was walking home from school in Aricanduva, Brazil when a glowing orb dropped 
          fell the sky and landed in front of him. The orb dimmed to reveal a 3-foot-tall humanoid 
          who pulled Paulo into the sky and up into a huge craft. Inside, Paulo was examined by ETs 
          and held a long conversation. They told him that no harm would come to him, that they were 
          visiting Earth to help, that God is real, that humanity needs to become peaceful before 
          they can show themselves, and much more. Returned to his home, Paulo learned that he had 
          been missing for 20 hours. Following the encounter, his stuttering problem disappeared. 
          He also learned that his mother had seen a UFO on the day Paulo was born.</p>

          <p><b>“YOU ARE PROGRESSING AS PLANNED.”</b> At <b>11:45 pm on Feb 10, 1981</b>, Kathy 
          (a medical professional) was driving to her home in Renton, WA when a glowing craft 
          appeared above her car. Alarmed, she drove the short distance to her apartment, only to 
          find that the UFO had followed her home. She ran to her front door, only to discover 
          that she had missing time. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard a 
          craft and examined by gray aliens who told her that she was doing well, that they were 
          pleased with how her father had taught her, and that they would meet again. She told 
          her father what happened. He wept and told her that he had been taken three times by 
          the same ETs.</p>

          <p><b>“YOU ARE TOO OLD.”</b> In the <b>early morning hours of Aug 12, 1983</b>, 77-year-
          old gardener, Alfred Burtoo set out for a fishing trip along the banks of a canal in 
          Aldershot, England. To his shock, a UFO landed nearby, and out came two 4-foot-tall 
          humanoids dressed in shiny green suits and helmets. They walked up to him and gestured 
          for him to follow them onboard their craft. Inside, Alfred saw rounded walls, a central 
          column, and a strange beam of light. They instructed him to stand under the light so 
          they could examine him. Afterwards they turned to him and said, “You can go. You are 
          too old and infirm for our purpose.” Mildly disappointed at being rejected by the ETs, 
          Alfred exited the craft, which promptly took off. Alfred later called it the greatest 
          experience of his life.</p>

          <p><b>“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.”</b> One <b>night in the 1990s</b>, Sharon Beals was in her 
          home in the USA when she saw odd lights through the skylight. At the same time, her 
          2-year-old daughter, Kelly (who had been complaining of monsters and “sky monkeys” 
          entering her room) came running in. Without warning, both woke up to realize that hours 
          had passed. Sharon discovered that her eyeglasses were bent so badly, they were now 
          useless. Knowing she had been taken again, she went under hypnosis and recalled being 
          taken onboard a craft. Inside she saw gray ETs who told her that they were her friends, 
          that she was safe, and did she want to help save the planet? Sharon saw her daughter and 
          several other people onboard the craft before being transported through the ceiling of 
          her home and into her bedroom.</p>

          <p>These five cases are just a tiny fraction of the actual number of onboard encounters, 
          and yet they provide an accurate representation of what it’s like to be taken into an 
          alien craft and interact directly with extraterrestrials. They contain both unique 
          elements and fascinating commonalities. They answer many of the questions surrounding 
          the UFO phenomenon, and also provide compelling evidence for UFO reality. They show 
          how complex and bizarre UFO contact can be, and how it is both transformative and 
          enlightening to those who have the experience. And most importantly, they make it 
          very clear that humanity is not alone in this amazing and infinite universe.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Each UFO case, whether a simple sighting or an onboard UFO 
          encounter, adds to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and provides another piece to 
          solving the UFO mystery. One of the most fascinating aspects of UFOs is that they 
          behave in weird ways. This video presents 12 very strange encounters that show the 
          high strangeness of ET contact. The cases come from all over the world and provide 
          strong evidence of UFO reality.</p>
          
          <p><b>“IT SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTED TO DO.”</b> <b>Aug 20, 1955</b> was a 
          windy day as two men stood on the dock of Kenora Bay in Ontario, Canada. Suddenly, a 
          saucer zoomed over the water, seeming to study the men. But then it moved to the 
          nearby hospital, and seemed to inspect that, before suddenly darting away.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO THAT LISTENED</b>. On <b>Sep 3, 1955</b>, Frank Flaig and his wife Ruth 
          drove along Boomer Rd in Cincinnati, OH, when a small silver sphere descended to the 
          ground. Frank stopped the car and went over to investigate. But his wife Ruth became 
          concerned for his safety and called out to him. Amazingly, the UFO seemed to react to 
          her voice and darted off.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE THIRSTY UFO</b>. In <b>Jul 1965</b>, John Hambling was working with another 
          man in the wilderness north of Hazelton, Canada when they saw a UFO swoop down over a 
          small alpine lake. The craft sent a cylinder down to the surface and began to suck up 
          the water. They were able to take several photos before the craft darted off. Was it 
          there for the water? Or was there another reason?</p>

          <p><b>“WE WANT TO WATCH FLYING SAUCERS.”</b> One <b>night in Aug 1967</b>, 12-year-old, 
          Leif told his parents that he and his friends were camping in the front yard of their 
          home in Duncan, Canada, to watch for flying saucers. His parents were amused. But 
          later, Leif rushed to the window to announce that the UFOs had arrived. His parents 
          rushed outside and saw the UFOs themselves.</p>

          <p><b>UFO INSPECTS FARMHOUSE</b>. On <b>Feb 19, 1968</b>, Martha Heggs was alone with 
          her two children in her farmhouse in Bengough, Canada when she heard a piercing noise. 
          Looking outside, she saw a flying saucer hovering over the power-pole. As her dog 
          cowered in fear and the cows ran for safety, the saucer closely inspected each area 
          of the farm. It was the strangest 20 minutes of Martha’s life.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDS AT WASHINGTON DC</b>. At <b>6am on Oct 24, 1968</b>, a paperboy was 
          making his rounds in Bethesda, Maryland when he saw a landed UFO in Fort Bayard Park, 
          along the border of Washington DC. He watched it for about three minutes when it 
          suddenly flew away, leaving a burnt circle of grass. The case would soon generate 
          interest at high levels of govt.</p>

          <p><b>PANIC AT THE POOL</b>. In <b>Oct of 1968</b>, tourists were enjoying themselves 
          in the pool at Sulphur Mountain Resort in Banff, Canada. Suddenly, a UFO appeared 
          over nearby Mt Rundle and everyone stopped to watch. Then the UFO swooped down at 
          high speed beside the pool, causing complete panic. Some people were injured and a 
          few went into clinical shock.</p>

          <p><b>SPEEDWAY DRIVER’S ORDEAL BY UFO</b>. <b>Early on Apr 13, 1971</b>, racecar 
          driver, Geoff Richards and his wife drove along a remote highway outside of 
          Brunswick, West Australia when a UFO swooped down and buzzed their car. But then 
          it returned and zoomed towards their car, playing a game of chicken, not once or 
          twice but several times.</p>

          <p><b>THE 15-TON CRAFT</b>. One <b>night in May 1971</b>, Angela Rajh saw an odd 
          glow near her home in Stara Cerkev, Yugoslavia. Going to investigate, she saw that 
          the glow was a landed flying saucer. She raced home, only to learn that her mother 
          saw the UFO. Also, her neighbors saw the craft on the ground and walked up to it. 
          Later they found some very odd landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>UFO BLOCKADE ON MPUSHINI BRIDGE</b>. On the <b>evening of July 22, 1972</b>, 
          two gentlemen were driving through Ashburton, South Africa when they came upon a 
          UFO sitting in the middle of the road on the Mpushini Bridge. Unable to pass, they 
          had no choice but to stop. The UFO took off a short time later and they called the 
          police, who saw it too.</p>

          <p><b>UFO TAKES OVER TRUCK</b>. On <b>Jul 18, 1976</b>, the sheriff’s office near 
          Gravel Switch, Kentucky was flooded with calls from people reporting UFOs. The UFO 
          flew around for hours. One lady said it chased her car. But the strangest call came 
          from two witnesses who said the UFO came down over their truck and took control of 
          the vehicle.</p>

          <p><b>MISSING TIME ON THE TOILET</b>. On the night of <b>Mar 13, 1979</b>, Mr. WP 
          went to visit the pub near his home in Alverthorpe, England. Strangely, however, 
          he found himself taking the wrong route. Unexpectedly he came upon a UFO which 
          chased him across the field. Suddenly he found himself standing in the public 
          restroom next to the pub with no idea how he got there.</p>

          <p>These twelve cases show how any encounter can provide profound insights into UFO 
          behavior. Only by examining all the cases will we discover the alien agenda and the 
          reasons for the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. And there is no shortage 
          of cases! The truth is coming out. We are being visited.</p>

          <h5>Dec 15, 2023 (1:08:05)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It’s one of the most mindboggling experiences a person can 
          have: a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial. And yet thousands (if not 
          millions) of people have had this experience. And yet, it is still not fully accepted 
          by mainstream society. Thankfully times are changing as governments across the world 
          begin to acknowledge the ET presence. And yet, they are still discussing only UFO 
          sightings and ignoring the cases of direct contact. This video presents ten amazing 
          cases of landings and humanoid encounters of all kinds. Cases from across the planet, 
          spanning many decades, involving multiple witnesses and a variety of evidence.</p>

          <p><b>A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING</b>. One day in <b>Aug 1944</b>, Mrs. E.M. 
          Church had a day off from her nursing duties at Cashmere Sanatorium in Christchurch, 
          New Zealand. She was hiking in the area when she came upon a landed craft and three 
          odd-looking humanoids. She hoped to speak with them and get a ride! But as she 
          approached, they fled into their craft. The aftereffects were as amazing as the 
          encounter itself.</p>

          <p><b>UFO LANDING WITH HUMANOIDS</b>. On <b>Mar 18, 1950</b>, Wilfredo H. Arevalo was 
          driving near his ranch at Lago Argentino, Argentina, when a craft with a transparent 
          dome landed nearby. Inside, he saw four pale-skinned humans wearing cellophane-like 
          jumpsuits. They shot a beam of light at him, and then took off. The next day, Wilfredo 
          found burned grass where the craft had landed. Also, many people in the area also 
          reported seeing the craft.</p>

          <p><b>THEY WALKED OFF INTO SPACE</b>. On <b>Oct 8, 1968</b>, four people in Asbestos, 
          Canada were puzzled by a greenish glow in the sky. Suddenly a flying saucer emerged 
          from the glow and began to move off. Two of the witnesses followed it as it moved away. 
          But two of the witnesses stayed at their house and were amazed to see humanoid figures 
          exit the craft and walk into empty space.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE ORCHARD</b>. It was <b>lunchtime in Aug of 1973</b> for farmhand 
          Edmond Cardoso de Oliveira at a farm in Nova Friburgo, Brazil. To his amazement, he saw 
          a silver, egg-shaped craft landed in the orchard. He walked up to the craft and suddenly 
          a door opened. He found himself face-to-face with a 3-foot-tall humanoid. Edmond fled. 
          He returned with more witnesses, but the craft was gone.</p>

          <p><b>THE THREE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOID</b>. On <b>Oct 19, 1973</b>, a family of three was 
          shocked to see a glowing red UFO hover over their farm in Copeland, NC. The wife screamed 
          and pointed to the ground. Standing before them was a 3-foot-tall humanoid in a golden 
          metallic suit. They fled in their car and refused to return until the next day. They 
          left their dog, but he also ran away and didn’t return until the next day.</p>

          <p><b>ETS FROM A PHONE-BOOTH-SHAPED UFO</b>. On <b>Oct 29, 1976</b>, six boys were 
          playing near a local cemetery in Barakaldo, Spain when they saw a strange object 
          descend into a walled-in field. Two of them ran to investigate and saw the craft on 
          the ground. Out stepped two tall figures. One walked up to the wall, knocked on it, 
          and then pulled out a laser-like device and shot at it. The boys fled in fear.</p>

          <p><b>ETS LIKE TOY SOLDIERS</b>. Around <b>3:00 am on Dec 31, 1976</b>, Nellie Richardson 
          was awakened in her home in Bignall, England by a loud bang. Looking outside, she saw a 
          huge oval-shaped object hovering in the fields outside her window. It stayed for nearly 
          40 minutes. As it began to move away, she saw little humanoids inside, moving back and 
          forth. Her son came home just in time to watch the object move off.</p>

          <p><b>ETS VISIT TRANSMITTER STATION</b>. On <b>Oct 18, 1977</b>, Kurt Nilsson was testing 
          out his ham radio by the transmitter station on Hemliden Mountain, Sweden. It strangely 
          malfunctioned, and that’s when he saw a landed UFO and three very short humanoids. He 
          tried to flee, but they aimed a strange device at him and stalled his car. Afterward, 
          more strange events occurred.</p>

          <p><b>THE BABYSITTER & THE ALIEN</b>. In <b>Feb 1981</b>, a 17-year-old girl babysat at 
          her neighbor’s house in Greensburg, PA when a UFO hovered outside. It was close enough 
          that inside, she could see two humanoids with large bald heads and weird eyes operating 
          a strange console. She felt entranced by them, but finally fled inside, when the electronics 
          of the house began to fail.</p>

          <p><b>RUSSIAN ROBOTIC ETS</b>. Around <b>2:30 pm on Jul 6, 1989</b>, a group of six 
          children watched in shock as a spherical UFO landed near their homes in Kharovsk, 
          Russia. The craft separated and out stepped a tall, robotic-like figure, which walked 
          across the field. Then another UFO landed and another ET came out. This happened a 
          third time! Then a fourth UFO landed. The strangeness had only begun.</p>

          <p>These ten cases provide a tantalizing and intriguing glimpse into the subject of 
          extraterrestrial visitation. They represent only the tip of the iceberg of the countless 
          of other encounters that have happened across the planet. There are too many cases to 
          ignore. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Each UFO encounter has something new to teach us about the 
          UFO phenomenon, and this is especially true with cases of face-to-face contact with 
          humanoids. The twelve cases presented here span many decades and come from across the 
          planet, and yet they show both remarkable commonalities and intriguing unique aspects. 
          So many independent witnesses, so many different kinds of extraterrestrials, so much 
          evidence! And most importantly, so many cases! The truth can no longer be denied!</p>
          
          <p><b>THE ETS ON THE PLATFORM</b>. On <b>Jul 25, 1938</b>, during a civil war in 
          Guadalajara, Spain, two military officers observed a disc-shaped object descend 
          nearby. To their shock, a platform with two humanoids extended from the craft. Not 
          knowing about UFOs, the men first thought it was a secret Russian military craft. 
          Before long, they would change their minds.</p>

          <p><b>THE CROUCHING ALIEN</b>. It was quitting time on <b>Sep 5, 1954</b>, as 12-year-old 
          John Jacob Swaim finished plowing the wheat-field of his family farm in Coldwater, 
          Kansas. Then he saw a tiny little man staring at him. He ran after the man, who floated 
          to a craft landed nearby. The craft quickly darted away. Afterward, hundreds of tiny 
          footprints were found in the field.</p>

          <p><b>THE PEACEFUL ET</b>. In <b>Jun of 1967</b>, Franjo Friedl was trimming trees in 
          his backyard in Croatia and saw what he first thought was a uniformed soldier. Then the 
          figure approached and Franjo saw that it was a strange 4-foot-tall humanoid. The ET said 
          he wanted to make  contact with Franjo,  and told him to tell no one. The ET ran into a 
          saucer, which flew away.</p>

          <p><b>THREE LITTLE SPACEMEN</b>. One <b>evening in Oct 1967</b>, Donald Marshall was 
          walking to his home in Melford, Saskatchewan, Canada. Behind his home, he saw a strange 
          light, and then saw it was actually a window attached to a craft landed. That’s when he 
          saw three little humanoids running around. They ran into the craft, which took off, 
          breaking off tree branches as it left.</p>

          <p><b>“HEY YOU…ALIENS!”</b> On the <b>night of Apr 26, 1969</b>, David Arychuk took his 
          dog Brandy for a walk by his home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Brandy stopped and look 
          up at a strange craft floating about 20 feet high. David then saw two humanoids standing 
          near the craft. His dog panicked and begged to go home. Upon returning shortly later, 
          the craft was gone.</p>

          <p><b>THE WILLARD UFO WAVE</b>. On the <b>night of Jan 22, 1971</b>, the phones at the 
          police station near Willard, Ohio rang off the hook with callers reporting UFOs. Among 
          the dozens of witnesses was a couple who said the UFO hovered 100 feet over their car. 
          Inside, through a transparent dome, they saw a strange humanoid.</p>

          <p><b>ENCOUNTER CAUSES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN</b>.  Around <b>4:30 am on Sep 9, 1972</b>, a 
          man observed a low-flying craft near his home in Glasgow, Scotland. Looking down at him 
          from a porthole of the craft, he saw a blond-haired humanoid wearing a silver suit. The 
          man was so traumatized that following the encounter, he suffered a nervous breakdown.</p>

          <p><b>THE TALL SILVER MAN</b>. It was <b>early afternoon on Jul 10, 1975</b> as the 
          Taylors drove near Ewloe, Clwyd in Wales. To their shock, they saw a 7-foot-tall 
          humanoid wearing a full-body silver jumpsuit picking up things alongside the road. At 
          first they kept their encounter secret. But then other people began to report seeing 
          the same strange being.</p>

          <p><b>EXTRATERRESTRIALS ON MOUNT EVEREST</b>. In <b>1933</b>, Frank Smythe was climbing 
          Everest when he saw two UFOs hovering overhead. Later, other climbers saw UFOs, 
          including Reinhold Messner and Doug Scott. Jan Scott (Doug’s wife) was at basecamp 
          and said everyone there saw the UFOs. One time, a UFO came so low, she saw figures 
          through a window.</p>

          <p><b>THE INJURED HUMANOID</b>. On the <b>night of Jun 12, 1977</b>, David X stepped 
          outside a hotel in Crystal Lake, Illinois and saw three 4-foot-tall humanoids approach. 
          He first thought they were coming for him. Then he saw another humanoid lying on the 
          ground only a few feet in front of him. That’s when he realized that the ETs were there 
          to rescue their fallen comrade.</p>
          
          <p><b>ROBOTIC ALIEN AT ATOMIC INSTALLATION</b>. On the <b>night of Mar 18, 1978</b>, Ken 
          Edwards was driving by an atomic installation by his home in Risley, England. He then 
          saw a silver-suited figure with outstretched arms walk into the middle of the road. Ken 
          was struck by a beam of light, which fried his radio. The figure walked through a fence 
          and disappeared. Soon events became even more bizarre.</p>
          
          <p><b>REPTILIANS OVER ELECTRIC STATION</b>. In the <b>Fall of 1990</b>, a couple drove 
          by an electric power station and saw a strange teardrop-shaped UFO cross the road ahead 
          of them and hover over the station. To their shock, they saw two reptilian humanoids 
          looking down at them through an open-air platform. One of them heard a mental message, 
          “Do not stay here. Go away!”</p>
          
          <p>These 12 humanoid encounters show how bizarre UFO encounters can be, and that we 
          still have much to learn about ET contact and the ET agenda on our planet. Yet they 
          make it very clear that we are not alone, and that we have been visited for a very 
          long time.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Onboard UFO Encounters! These cases are the heart of the UFO 
          phenomenon. Almost everything we know about ET contact comes from the people who have 
          been inside UFOs. These are the most extensive and interesting of all UFO encounters. 
          This video presents five fascinating firsthand cases involving people from across the 
          world who have been onboard a UFO and interacted with aliens.</p>

          <p><b>MUST HAVE WATER!</b> One evening in the <b>Spring of 1951</b>, an anonymous 
          engineer, HM, drove near the Drakenstein Mountain in Paarl, South Africa when a man 
          flagged his car down. “Have you any water?” he asked. HM said no, but agreed to drive 
          the man to a nearby stream and get some water. The man then asked HM to drive back up 
          the road. To HM’s shock, they came upon a landed flying saucer. The man invited HM 
          inside the craft, where he saw four other men. The man said that they needed water 
          to cure an injured companion. They agreed to answer any questions HM might have. HM 
          asked how the ETs power their craft. He asked where they came from, and they pointed 
          to the stars, but refused to be more specific. HM was ushered off the craft. 
          Returning the next day, he was amazed to find weird landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>TAKEN IN ITAPERUNA</b>. On the <b>night of Sep 25, 1971</b>, Paulo Caetano DaSilva 
          was driving through Itaperuna, Brazil when a saucer-shaped craft chased his car down the 
          road. He went to the police station and told them what happened. He then returned on his 
          journey, only to have the saucer land on the road and stall his car. Three little men 
          exited and pulled Paulo onboard where he was examined. Paulo fell unconscious and the 
          next thing he knew, he was being set down next to his car. Paulo was shocked and 
          disoriented, and his eyes were very sore. He went to the police and told them what 
          happened. To his shock, another man, Benedito Miranda, reported an encounter on the 
          same night, and people throughout the area saw UFOs. Little did Paulo know that his 
          encounters had only begun. The ETs would soon return, this time with a profound 
          message.</p>

          <p><b>OWYHEE RIVER ENCOUNTER</b>. One day in the <b>Summer of 1975</b>, a married 
          couple, Darryl and Toni were on vacation near the Owyhee River in Oregon. They 
          stopped by the road when they saw what they thought was a plane in the sky, except 
          it was silent. Upon returning home, they found that they were missing two hours of 
          time. Darryl became very depressed, and Toni noticed an increase in psychic abilities. 
          Knowing something strange had happened to them, they went under hypnosis and recalled 
          being taken onboard a craft. Darryl recalled being examined by short, gray-skinned 
          ETs, who proceeded to heal an old childhood injury to his arm. Toni was told by the 
          ETs that because she was psychic, they would allow her to observe the healing 
          procedure. Afterward, both felt it was a benevolent encounter, and Darryl described 
          the ETs as very loving.</p>

          <p><b>TAKEN ON CRYSTAL MOUNTAIN</b>. At <b>2:30 pm on Jul 14, 1985</b>, Joseph left the 
          lodge at the Crystal Mountain Ski Resort in Washington State to take a hike up the 
          mountain. No sooner had he left when he suddenly found himself lying face down 2000 
          feet up the side of the mountain, disoriented, sore, with five unexplained needle-marks 
          on his back. He stumbled back down, met his partner, Cassandra at the lodge and learned 
          that he was missing two hours of time. Wondering what had happened to him, Joseph 
          sought hypnosis and learned that he had been taken onboard a craft. Inside he was 
          shocked to see more than 25 short, grayish-green, humanoid ETs. He was placed on a 
          table and physically examined. He remembered them doing something to his back. He was 
          then placed back on the mountain. Following this, he had two close-up UFO sightings.</p>

          <p><b>TAKEN IN THE YUKON</b>. On the <b>morning of Sep 3, 1987</b>, Kevin Bramm drove his 
          motorbike along a remote highway in Yukon, Canada. Stopping to go pee, he was shocked to 
          see a UFO fly across the road ahead of him. Moments later, he saw two insectoid-looking 
          figures, who struck him with a beam of light. Time seemed to stop, and Kevin had the 
          sensation of being paralyzed and drawn upward. The next thing he knew, it was nearly 
          nighttime. He got on his bike and rushed off. Upon arrival to his trailer, he heard an 
          odd buzzing sound, but was too scared to investigate. But it was then that he remembered 
          being taken onboard a craft with strange instruments and panels, and two gray ETs. They 
          gave him strange liquid so he wouldn’t remember. Kevin wanted to remember, but drank the 
          liquid. Afterward, he found two strange scoop marks on his hands.</p>

          <p>These five cases provide a vivid portrayal of what it’s like to be taken onboard a UFO 
          and meet extraterrestrials face-to-face. These cases are supported by multiple witnesses, 
          landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. They show that 
          ETs are actively engaged in taking people onboard their craft and have been visiting our 
          planet for a very long time.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There's nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with an 
          extraterrestrial. UFO sightings are interesting, but  these UFOs have occupants inside 
          them, humanoids of all different kinds. This video presents ten extraordinary little-
          known cases of people who have had close encounters with UFO occupants. These cases 
          span many decades and come from all over the world. They provide compelling evidence of 
          UFO/ET reality. They show what it’s like to have contact with ETs, and also answer many 
          of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <p><b>THE SAUCER IN THE CELERY FIELD</b>. In <b>Oct of 1928</b>, an 80-year-old lady was 
          checking her celery field of her farm in northern WI and came upon a landed craft. To 
          her shock, she saw several small figures exit the craft and run into the woods. Intrigued, 
          she approached the craft and ventured inside. She was amazed to see little seats, a bunch 
          of food-wafers, but very little equipment. Then officials came and took the craft away.</p>

          <p><b>THE WAVERLY UFO LANDING & HUMANOID</b>. On <b>Aug 13, 1965</b>, David Gibson (age 14,) 
          and his family saw a UFO fly over their home in Waverly, IA. To their amazement, the object 
          descended behind a hill. David ran to investigate, and saw a three-foot-tall bald creature 
          standing nearby. The being ran off into the woods. David then saw the craft dart away. And 
          after some exploring, he found a 20-foot circle of burned grass.</p>

          <p><b>ETS INVESTIGATE EARTHQUAKE</b>. On <b>Jul 31, 1967</b>, an earthquake struck 
          Caracas, Venezuela. Three days later, afraid to be in their damaged home, Juan and 
          Maria Desoto slept in their car. Suddenly a disc-shaped craft appeared overhead, 
          released a smaller craft, and out came a humanoid. It examined the ground, scooping 
          up various stones. They watched it for 15 minutes. The next day, their neighbors 
          said they saw the UFO too.</p>

          <p><b>BALD & BEARDED RED REPTILIAN ALIEN IN A GRAVEYARD</b>. On <b>Aug 29, 1968</b>, 
          a group of boys playing in a graveyard in Coleraine, Quebec, Canada was amazed to 
          see a UFO and a dwarf-like figure. The next day it returned, and more kids saw it. 
          Then, on the third day, the ET and UFO returned, and this time, two adults saw it. 
          On the fourth day, more than 300 people came to see if the UFO and ET would return.</p>

          <p><b>THE THING ON THE STAIRS</b>. On <b>Sep 15, 1968</b>, KBJ (an officer of the 
          British Army) was guarding the Dhekelia Army Barracks on the island of Cyprus. At 
          around <b>3:00 am</b>, a whining noise filled the room. The guard dog whimpered 
          and hid under the bed. KBJ opened the door and saw a bizarre humanoid with glowing 
          eyes, red hair floating up the stairs. He slammed the door shut and grabbed a gun.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO LANDED IN MY BACKYARD</b>. One <b>evening in Jan 1969</b>, Adeline Davis 
          woke up to see a landed UFO had in her backyard. She could hardly believe her eyes 
          as she saw a strange human-looking figure staring back at her from inside the craft. 
          For the next 20 minutes, the craft remained. At the time, all the power in the house 
          failed. Finally the craft left, but Adeline would never be the same again.</p>

          <p><b>SUCKED THROUGH THE WINDOW</b>. On <b>Apr 2, 1971</b>, a man from Greenhill, NSW, 
          Australia went to the kitchen to get a drink of water. He saw a strange face staring 
          at him from outside. Suddenly, a strange force gripped him and pulled him through the 
          window. He fell to the ground outside. His wife ran into the kitchen just in time to 
          watch it happen. Unknown them, many people in the area saw UFOs at that time.</p>

          <p><b>THE HUMANOID ON THREE MILE LAKE ROAD</b>. On <b>Oct 9, 1975</b>, Robert Suffern 
          drove down the road to investigate a strange glow behind his barn in Utterson, Ontario, 
          Canada. Instead, he came upon a strange craft landed in the road. It quickly took off, 
          but moments later, as Robert drove back home, a strange humanoid jumped in front his 
          car. He told the police what happened, but regretted this decision.</p>

          <p><b>THE CRACKNECK CREATURE</b>. On <b>Oct 10, 1976</b>, a woman driving with several 
          other cars along a road near Crackneck Lookout in NSW, Australia was puzzled to see the 
          other cars race away. Looking up, she realized a flying saucer was pacing her car. She 
          sped off too. Later that night, two couples at Crackneck Lookout saw a strange 9-foot-tall 
          hairless humanoid with fly-like eyes.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS AT STONEHENGE</b>. On the <b>evening of Nov 18, 1990</b>, a couple (Lee 
          &amp; Dorne) went to visit Stonehenge. Dorne was amazed to see a UFO hovering nearby. Lee 
          strangely refused to look, but then he saw a strange 7-foot tall figure lurking among 
          the stones of the monument. The couple fled in fear. Following the encounter, numerous 
          strange events occurred.</p>

          <p>These ten cases provide a cross-section of cases involving direct, firsthand, face-to-face 
          contact with aliens. And yet, they are only the tip of the iceberg. And yet, these cases 
          teach us many things. They show us that ET contact is worldwide, ongoing and is supported 
          by compelling evidence. They also show us what it’s like to meet an ET, and that an 
          encounter can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The UFO phenomenon is one of the most persistent and 
          perplexing mysteries of modern times. While it has become increasingly evident that 
          we are dealing with extraterrestrials, there are still many questions surrounding 
          UFO activity on our planet. Cases of face-to-face contact with ETs remain the heart 
          of the UFO phenomenon, but UFO sightings are far more numerous. This video presents 
          15 unusual and provocative sightings from across the planet, each of which raises 
          important questions and provides profound insights.</p>

          <p><b>THE MINIATURE UFO</b>. One day in <b>1932</b> in Nambour, Australia, a young 
          boy was playing with his friends when he came upon a landed craft only one foot 
          wide. Standing next to it, he felt strange sensations in his body. He retreated 
          from the object, which promptly took off. That night, blisters formed on his hands.</p>

          <p><b>THE FAITH HEALER & THE FLYING SAUCER</b>. In <b>1950</b> in Kenya, Africa, 
          a faith healer visited the home of a man whose mother had suffered a stroke which 
          left her paralyzed. While healing the woman, the faith healer told to the man to 
          go outside and look at the sky. The man was shocked to see three UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO AT THE BUS-STOP</b>. On <b>May 9, 1956</b>, Gertie Wynn and her friend 
          Joan Frost sat at a bus-stop in Jacksonville, FL when a UFO dropped from the sky and 
          hovered overhead. Both felt certain they were about to be kidnapped by the UFO. Just 
          then, the bus arrived.</p>

          <p><b>DIVE-BOMBED BY A UFO</b>. Around <b>11pm on Jun 24, 1957</b>, three teenagers 
          were driving near Russellville, IN when they saw a UFO overhead. The next night at 
          the same time and place, the UFO returned. This time, it swooped down and ejected a 
          smaller object which entered their car and exploded.</p>

          <p><b>UFO CAR CHASE</b>. On the <b>night of Mar 13, 1967</b>, Cecil Perkins was in 
          his home in San De Fuca, WA when a man knocked on his door saying that a UFO had 
          chased him down the highway. Looking up, Cecil was amazed to see that the UFO still 
          there.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO THAT TALKED BACK</b>. On <b>Nov 15, 1967</b>, Alan Poole was driving 
          at Yerecoin, Australia when a UFO landed right next to his car. It was so close, he 
          could barely open the door. Alan shouted at the UFO. To his amazement, the UFO shouted 
          back at him, then took off.</p>

          <p><b>FIREFIGHTING ALIENS</b>. In <b>Jun 1968</b>, southern Morocco was struck by a 
          heatwave which caused more than 16 wildfires. One witness described how he saw a 
          saucer-shaped craft drop down and hover above one of the fires, which immediately 
          became extinguished!</p>

          <p><b>UFO SETS MAN’S HAIR ON FIRE</b>. On <b>Jul 20, 1968</b>, Anders Stenlund stood 
          in his front yard in Norrland, Sweden. Suddenly, a 23-foot-wide saucer swooped over 
          his head. Anders threw himself to the ground in fear. At that point, he felt a blast 
          of heat and smelled something burning. To his shock, it was his hair!</p>

          <p><b>MORSE CODE UFO</b>. On <b>Jun 18, 1971</b>, a family from Ben Lomond, CA was 
          puzzled when the electronics in their house began pulsating in a weird Morse Code-like 
          pattern. Looking outside, they saw a UFO blinking in the same pattern. Not only that, 
          so were the city lights all around them!</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO AND THE FREEZER</b>. On <b>Dec 5, 1973</b>, a family was in their home 
          in La Selva Beach, CA when their freezer alarm went off for no reason. Looking outside, 
          they saw a UFO blinking in rhythm to their freezer alarm.</p>

          <p><b>HARRASSED BY A UFO</b>. After a UFO swooped over a family’s campsite on <b>Jun 18, 
          1972</b> in Barstow, CA, they found themselves being followed by the same UFO the next 
          night and forced off the highway. When others stopped to help the family, they also saw 
          the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>WHAT THE UFO DID TO THE GAS STATION</b>. On <b>Jul 31, 1976</b>, Eldon’s Standard 
          Service Station in Council Bluffs, IA suffered a series of bizarre damage to the 
          equipment in the station. Meanwhile, people in the area saw a UFO hovering only 100 
          feet overhead.</p>

          <p><b>SUSIE’S PUPPIES & THE UFO</b>. On <b>Feb 4, 1978</b>, the Semaza family of Orange, 
          CA was awakened by a UFO buzzing over their home. Meanwhile, their dog, Susie (who had a 
          new litter of puppies) also heard the UFO, and she was not happy. Susie began to hide 
          her pups to protect them from the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>WASHED-UP UFO</b>. On the <b>night of May 29, 1971</b>, a man was walking along 
          Yaquina Beach in Newport, OR when he came upon a strange glowing object that had 
          apparently washed onto the beach from the ocean. He called the police who also saw 
          the object. Before they could investigate, the object disappeared.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN ALIBI</b>. In <b>2000</b>, a man was arrested by the Des Moines, IA police 
          for trespassing into a stranger’s home. The man, however, protested his innocence. He 
          said that he had not broken in. He had been 170 miles away when a UFO scooped him up. 
          The next thing he knew, he woke up in the stranger’s house.</p>

          <p>These 15 cases show how even a simple sighting can raise more questions than they 
          answer. They show that every encounter is unique and provides an important piece of 
          the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. And most importantly, they make it very clear 
          that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">When UFOs land and people have face-to-face encounters with 
          humanoids or are taken onboard a craft, we find ourselves at the very heart of the UFO 
          phenomenon. While sightings are undeniably fascinating, the answers to the many questions 
          surrounding this subject lie with direct contact. These kinds of cases contain the most 
          data and show us exactly what it’s like to have close interaction with extraterrestrials. 
          This video presents ten cases coming from across the globe, spanning several decades, and 
          involving many different types of humanoids. These cases provide the kind of evidence that 
          cannot be ignored or explained away, including landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, 
          medical effects, animal reactions and more.</p>

          <p><b>ITALY’S FIRST HUMANOID?</b> On <b>Aug 14, 1947</b>, Luigi Rapuzzi Johannis was hiking in 
          the mountains near Raveo, Italy when he came upon a landed saucer-shaped craft. Standing 
          next to it were two of the strangest figures he had ever seen. Attempting to communicate, 
          he found himself being struck by a beam of light and unable to move. The ETs approached him, 
          then retreated into their craft and departed.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO IN TROUBLE</b>. On the <b>evening of Apr 24, 1950</b>, Bruno Facchini stepped outside 
          his home in Varese, Italy to investigate strange flashing lights. To his shock, he came 
          upon a landed craft and human-looking figures who appeared to be trying to repair it. Not 
          yet realizing that these figures were ETs, he asked if they needed help. They struck him 
          with a beam of light, knocking him to the ground. Later, he found evidence at the site.</p>

          <p><b>ENTITIES EXAMINE A FACTORY</b>. One <b>night in 1967</b>, the supervisor at a rubber factory 
          in Goshen, Indiana was called outside by a fellow employee and saw a large craft hovering 
          low overhead. Through the windows, they saw strange figures looking down at them, apparently 
          inspecting the factory. After only a few moments, the craft moved away. But the witnesses 
          remain convinced they saw a genuine UFO.</p>

          <p><b>ETs AT SEA!</b> On <b>Jun 27, 1970</b>, the Machado family and a friend were enjoying lunch 
          on the balcony of their home overlooking the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Seeing a 
          splash in the water, they saw a silver saucer landing on the surface of the ocean just 
          offshore. And inside they saw two short figures. The encounter had only just begun.</p>

          <p><b>THE VIRGINIA GIANT</b>. On <b>evening of May 16, 1971</b>, three high school 
          students decided to go camping in the fields near their homes in Passapatanzy, 
          Virginia. “Mike” was alone at the campsite with his dog. Suddenly a UFO landed 
          right next to him, and out stepped a giant figure. When it walked towards Mike, 
          he told his dog to “sick ‘em!” The figure quickly fled to the craft, which took 
          off. But two days later, the UFO came back, this time at Mike’s home.</p>

          <p><b>ETs ON THE ISLAND OF FUR SEALS</b>. On <b>Oct 28, 1972</b>, a group of military personnel 
          were staying on the Isla de Lobos off the coast of Uruguay. One of them went to check on 
          the lighthouse generators, and came upon a landed craft and three strange humanoids. The 
          officer pulled his gun, only to find himself unable to move. The UFO and occupants quickly 
          departed, but news of the encounter would go to the top of both the Uruguayan and US 
          governments.</p>

          <p><b>“IT CAN’T BE HUMAN.”</b> Around <b>2:30 am on Oct 24, 1974</b>, Mrs. R Heitfeld was woken 
          up in her home in Covedale, OH by a light shining in her window. Looking outside, she saw 
          a UFO and a strange ape-like creature standing inside it. She woke up her son, and called 
          the police. Even though the craft and occupant were still there, the police refused to come.</p>

          <p><b>THE TINY DOLL-LIKE ALIENS</b>. On <b>Sep 3, 1976</b>, a grandmother and her niece were 
          walking in Fence Houses, England and came upon a landed craft and two doll-sized ETs. 
          They found themselves unable to move and experienced possible missing time before the 
          craft suddenly left. The next day, the witness experienced a very odd incident in her 
          home.</p>

          <p><b>TRUCKER ABDUCTED</b>. Nothing could have prepared trucker, Harry Joe Turner, for 
          what happened on <b>Aug 28, 1979</b>, while driving his truck along Route 17 outside of 
          Winchester, VA. A huge craft came down and lifted his truck into the air. Harry found 
          himself being examined by ETs, and taken to another planet. His strange adventures had 
          only just begun.</p>

          <p><b>ET PHONE HOME</b>. On <b>Jul 4, 1989</b>, David D was driving in Tbilisi, Georgia (in 
          Russia) when his car engine failed and he felt compelled to walk to a certain location. 
          To his amazement, he came upon four figures, nearly nine-feet-tall, and a landed craft. 
          He was taken onboard and given an examination and shown very advanced ET technology.</p>

          <p>These ten cases provide only a brief glimpse into the many thousands of ET contact 
          cases that have been occurring across our planet for many decades. They show that we 
          still have a lot to learn about UFOs and about ourselves. They also make it very clear 
          that we are not alone, and that many different types of life abound in this infinite 
          universe.</p>

          <h5>Nov 3, 2023 (1:09:32)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO Encounters can be very weird, but some are incredibly odd. 
          Some contain extremely high levels of strangeness with unique or rarely seen features. 
          These are the kinds of cases that provide important insights into the nature of the UFO 
          phenomenon. This video presents ten exceptionally odd cases, reaching back to the <b>1930s</b> 
          up to the present day. They come from all over the world. And they provide undeniable 
          evidence for the reality of the extraterrestrial visitations.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH</b>. In <b>1933</b>, a young man was driving late at 
          night near Cherryville, PA and saw a strange purple light out in a field. Approaching, 
          he was amazed to come upon some type of weird craft. And the door was open. Peering 
          inside, he saw bizarre, unrecognizable equipment. He had never heard of UFOs, and it 
          wasn’t until years later that he realized that the object was probably an alien craft.</p>

          <p><b>KNOCKED OVER BY A UFO</b>. On <b>Oct 21, 1963</b>, the Moreno family of Trancas,
          Argentina was woken by six glowing discs landed near their home. One was very close to 
          them and when they went to investigate, it exploded with light, knocking them to the 
          ground. For the next 40 minutes, the craft targeted their home with beams of light, 
          raising the temperature inside to over 100 degrees. Afterward, it left evidence behind 
          that amazed everyone.</p>

          <p><b>UFO BENDS CAR HEADLIGHTS</b>. Late at <b>night on Apr 4, 1966</b>, Ron Sullivan 
          drove near Ballarat, Australia and came upon a landed. As he approached, his headlights 
          bent by themselves, veering off the road and onto the object. Ron was barely able to 
          keep his vehicle on the road. The object took off, and so did Ron. Two days later, 
          another man driving by the exact same spot suffered an unexplained fatal accident.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO AND THE BLOODMOBILE</b>. On the <b>evening of Mar 5, 1967</b>, Beau 
          Shertzer and a nurse were driving a bloodmobile along Route 2 in the Ohio Valley 
          when a UFO appeared and began to pace them. To their shock, the UFO extended to 
          weird arm-like devices as if trying to capture the bloodmobile. Thankfully, oncoming 
          traffic aborted the encounter. Beau was so traumatized, he refused to drive that 
          route ever again.</p>

          <p><b>THE BUBBLE-CAR UFO</b>. One <b>night in Aug 1970</b>, Mr. P was riding his bicycle 
          to his home in Birr, Ireland when he saw a bright star-like object zoom toward him and 
          stop overhead. He could now see that it was a craft with a clear glass-like dome. He 
          could hardly believe what he saw inside: four men and four women in military uniform 
          sitting in two rows of seats.</p>

          <p><b>CAR COOKED BY AN ALIEN</b>. While driving along I-75 near Ashburn, GA, late at 
          <b>night on Oct 19, 1973</b>, Mrs. Robinson’s car inexplicably broke down. Sensing a
          presence, she looked to her left and saw a short robotic entity staring at her. For 
          the next five minutes it walked around her car, and then disappeared. Afterward, her 
          car engine was so hot, it practically melted.</p>

          <p><b>STUCK TO THE WALL BY A UFO</b>. In <b>1976</b>, a young man was babysitting his 
          younger brother in their home in Bangor, Ireland. Oddly, the younger brother suddenly 
          went to bed, the house heated up and all traffic noise stopped. Looking outside, the 
          witness saw a glowing craft hover over the road. Without warning, it struck him with 
          a beam of light, lifted him off the floor, threw him against the wall, and held him 
          there. When it left, strange landing traces were found outside.</p>

          <p><b>LEVITATED BY A UFO</b>. On <b>Feb 12, 1979</b>, a man walking along the train 
          tracks in Headingly, England saw a green object pace him. Suddenly, it moved overhead, 
          pulled him up into the air, and carried him several feet forward. Then it set him 
          gently back down and zoomed off. The witness was so shocked, he refused to ever walk 
          that route again.</p>

          <p><b>CONVERSATION WITH A UFO</b>. On <b>Mar 24, 1988</b>, Mr. R was drawn outside by 
          a strange light over his home in Tetbury, England. Suddenly it was right over his head 
          and struck him with a beam of light. To his shock, the UFO spoke to him. Mr. R ended 
          up having a long conversation with the UFO, which warned him that humanity's use of 
          atomic power.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN’T EXIST</b>. One <b>night in Feb 2013</b>, two teenagers 
          from Richmond, BC, Canada were taking a walk, when a UFO appeared over their heads. 
          They followed it to a nearby school and were shocked to see a black entity hanging 
          upside from the monkey bars. It was an encounter that would change their lives forever.

          <p>These ten cases provide a fascinating glimpse into the high strangeness that seems to 
          be a big part of the UFO phenomenon. And although they are all incredibly odd, the fact 
          that there are so many of them, viewed by multiple witnesses and supported by a wide 
          variety of evidence, makes them hard to dismiss, ignore or explain away. UFOs are real! 
          We are being visited by a wide variety of ETs. The truth is coming out!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Almost all UFO encounters are interesting, but some are 
          exceptionally interesting. This is especially true with cases involving landed UFOs 
          and extensive interactions with humanoids. This video presents ten exceptionally strange 
          cases with bizarre or unique aspects. These ten cases (coming from across the world) 
          contain powerful evidence for the reality of the alien presence on our planet, including 
          landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more.</p>

          <p><b>“IT’S NOT HUMAN!”</b> Around <b>8:00pm on Aug 23, 1967</b>, two 15-year-olds (Erik 
          & Inga) were walking near their home in Kolmarden, Sweden, and saw a glowing red craft in 
          the sky, then land near them. Feeling like they were being watched, they fled. Moments 
          later, they came face-to-face with a weird humanoid. It held an odd device in its hand 
          and pointed it at them. The children ran in fear. Afterwards, landing traces were found.</p>

          <p><b>ALIEN CAR MECHANICS?</b> At <b>3:00am on Apr 27, 1969</b>, Mr. NN was driving 
          south of Slagelse, Denmark when he had a feeling he was being watched. Suddenly a UFO 
          appeared, zoomed towards his car and landed. His car engine and lights died. Four tiny 
          ETs exited the craft and surrounded his car. Then a tube-like device extruded from the 
          craft and snaked towards his car. After the craft left, landing traces proved the 
          encounter.</p>

          <p><b>UFOS INVADE IOWA FARM</b>. In <b>1969</b>, researcher Glenn McWayne was contacted 
          by an electrical lineman about strange burned circles of vegetation in Clayton County, 
          Iowa. In the center of the activity was a rural farmhouse. The family reported an ongoing 
          series of sightings, landings, and even face-to-face meetings with humanoids. One of the 
          kids saw a humanoid, and watched it remove its helmet and stare right at him.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE CAGE</b>. One <b>summer morning in 1971</b>, an anonymous nurse from 
          Iowa City, Iowa was drove to work and saw a cage-like object dangling in the sky. To her 
          shock, a figure in a white, thick, overall stared down at her from the cage. Unknown to 
          her, many people in the area also saw the humanoid. Reports came into the local police 
          station who began an investigation, but were unable to identify it.</p>

          <p><b>THE SILVER-SUITED ALIENS</b>. On the <b>evening of Oct 22, 1973</b>, Debbie Carne 
          drove along a road outside of Hartford, Indiana when she saw two short silver-clad 
          figures cross the road in front of her. Minutes later, Mr. & Mrs. Donathan drove along 
          the same road and came upon the same entities. They reported them to the police. Gary 
          Flatter was at the station and went with another officer to investigate, and saw the 
          ETs himself.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE GRAVEL PIT</b>. At <b>2:00 pm on Mar 24, 1977</b>, “Dan” walked 
          by a gravel pit near his home by Wildwood Lake in Ontario, Canada when he felt a blast 
          of heat. Looking down, he saw a strange metallic craft. Shortly later, he saw it again. 
          This time, he approached and knocked on it. Then a strange-looking humanoid exited and 
          stared right at him. When it moved toward him, Dan fled. But his encounters weren’t 
          over yet.</p>

          <p><b>ASSAULTED BY ALIENS</b>. On <b>Nov 24, 1978</b>, Angelo D’Ambrose was collecting 
          firewood near his home in Gallio, Italy when he saw two strange humanoids standing only 
          three feet away. One of them lunged forward and tried to grab his woodcutting tool. 
          After three failed attempts, the ETs fled. Angelo chased them, and was amazed to come 
          upon a flying saucer., and watched as it departed. Nearby, other people also saw the 
          UFO.</p>

          <p><b>A WARNING FOR ALL HUMANITY</b>. In <b>1979</b>, Mr. DL of Edinburgh, Scotland was 
          distressed to start hearing voices in his head calling his name. A visit to the doctor 
          brought no relief. Later, on the evening of Feb 16, 1980, events came to a climax when 
          Mr. DL saw a UFO hover. Suddenly he was struck by a beam of light, then was approached 
          by three ETs. One approached him and issued a dire warning for all humanity.</p>

          <p><b>THE PEEPING TOM ET</b>. One <b>evening in Mar of 1982</b>, “Mary,” was taking a 
          bath in her home in Hespeler, Canada, and saw a strange humanoid silhouette peer into 
          her bathroom window. Then it happened again. When it happened a third time, there were 
          two of them. Shortly later, she was shocked to see a UFO land in her backyard. Soon 
          she would have another encounter!</p>

          <p><b>“THEY WEREN’T HUMAN.”</b> On the <b>evening of Jul 21, 2001</b>, “Jeff” was 
          playing with his cousins near his grandmother’s home in rural Geneva, Pennsylvania. 
          Suddenly the noticed a blue light in the woods. Going to investigate, he was shocked 
          to come upon a landed UFO and two humanoids, who were picking up things off the 
          ground. One of the ETs looked at him, and then the other.</p>

          <p>When a person has an extensive face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial, 
          they are forever changed. With so many cases occurring all over the world, supported 
          by multiple eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence, the ET presence can no 
          longer be denied, ignored, or covered up. The time has come to accept the truth of 
          extraterrestrial visitation.</p>

          <h5>Oct 20, 2023 (1:14:33)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Aliens, aliens, aliens! People have been encountering 
          humanoids for a very long time. In fact, there are strong indications that UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth since recorded history. Only in the past 
          century, however, has this subject been recognized, documented, and studied. This 
          video presents 13 firsthand cases of face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials. 
          These cases span more than 100 years, starting in the <b>1920s</b>, all the way up 
          through the <b>2020s</b>. They come from all over the world. They feature a wide 
          variety of humanoids. And many contain multiple witnesses and compelling physical 
          evidence, including landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, 
          physiological effects and more.</p>

          <p><b>UNDER THE PROTECTION OF ALIENS</b>. In <b>Aug 1923</b>, Jacques B Bley (age 12) 
          suffered from obesity, until he was visited by ETs in his home in Barcelona, Spain. 
          Feeding him a mysterious substance, they healed Jacques and changed the course of his 
          life forever.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE BACKYARD</b>. One day in <b>1930</b>, Joseph and Ella Rankin were 
          shocked to see a large UFO hover overhead and then land in the backyard of their home in 
          Greensboro, NC. Inside they saw a strange humanoid. It was an experience they kept secret 
          for many years.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN WHO CAME TO SAY HELLO</b>. On <b>Jul 9, 1947</b>, an unnamed merchant 
          seaman from Houston, TX called the Houston Post to report a unique encounter. He said 
          that a saucer landed by his home and out stepped a humanoid. The ET approached, shook 
          his hand, then departed as quickly as he arrived.</p>

          <p><b>THE HANDSOME HUMAN-LOOKING ALIEN</b>. On <b>Aug 20, 1954</b>, sisters Aasta 
          Solvang and Edith Jacobsen were picking blueberries near their home in Mosjoen, Norway 
          when they were approached by a strange man. He spoke in a foreign language, then led 
          them to a flying saucer parked in the forest.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN AT THE ICE-SKATING RINK</b>. It was a <b>sunny morning on Nov 28, 
          1972</b> as Mario Mercier ice-skated next to his home in La Sarre, Quebec, Canada. 
          Suddenly a weird cloudlike object landed and out stepped three robotic figures. By 
          the time the encounter ended, there would be physical evidence.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE LIVING ROOM</b>. On <b>Nov 28, 1972</b>, Alfonso Rey was watching 
          TV in his home in Tres Arroyos, Argentina when his TV failed. As he got up to fix it, a 
          strange-looking spaceman appeared in his living room, beginning a strange interaction that 
          would result in a miraculous healing.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD</b>. On the <b>night of Feb 4, 1973</b>, Brian 
          Hunt and Sharyn Finckler drove along the Eyre Highway near Kimba, Australia and saw an 
          amazing sight. Alongside the road was a glowing humanoid. They fled in fear. Little did 
          they know, other people also saw the weird ET.</p>

          <p><b>THE CROSS-EYED ALIENS</b>. Around <b>2:00 am on Apr 30, 1983</b>, Madame X of 
          Sospel, France woke up to see a glowing red sphere in her bedroom. Moments later, 
          four human-looking ETs appeared. And they had a profound message to share with her 
          about the state of our world.</p>

          <p><b>THE GIANT SILVER ALIEN</b>. Tziporet Carmel of Kidima, Israel, was surprised to 
          find herself waking up earlier than normal on <b>Mar 20, 1993</b>. She was even more 
          surprised to look outside and see a huge silver craft landed in her backyard, and next 
          to it, a giant silver alien. Her life would never be the same.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE GRAY ALIEN BOY</b>. In <b>Mar 1998</b>, Felix Polanco had just begun 
          to excavate a road near Fajardo, Puerto Rico when he saw something incredible in his 
          headlights: a gray alien figure. It was definitely not human. Later that day, he and 
          others would see a UFO in the same area.</p>

          <p><b>THE FLYING ALIEN</b>. When three residents of Narli, Turkey went to go plow 
          their tobacco field on the <b>morning of Jun 4, 2001</b>, they were confronted by a 
          2-foot-tall flying humanoid. One of the witnesses, Fevzi Cam, tried to throw rocks at 
          the short figure. Soon, others would see the weird alien.</p>

          <p><b>APPROACHED BY AN ALIEN</b>. On the <b>evening of Feb 12, 2010</b>, Roy Shaw, a 
          retired engineer decided to take his dog, Sydney, for a walk in Phear Park, near his 
          home in Exmouth, England. To their shock, they saw a landed UFO. Then a glowing figure 
          exited the craft and began to approach them.</p>

          <p><b>A NINE-FOOT-TALL ALIEN</b>. On <b>Sep 4, 1990</b>, an unnamed man from Oregon 
          stepped onto his patio around sunset and was amazed to see a 30-foot-diameter craft 
          hovering only 50 feet above his neighbor’s roof. And inside, through a transparent 
          dome, he saw a 9-foot-tall greenish-skinned creature.</p>

          <p>These thirteen cases provide a mere glimpse into the huge number of extraterrestrial
          visitations that have been occurring across the globe for more than a century. With so 
          many witnesses, so many cases, occurring year after year, decade after decade, and 
          supported by compelling physical evidence, it’s time that humanity accepts we are not 
          alone in this vast universe. In fact, the universe appears to be quite crowded! And one 
          day, perhaps soon, everyone on Earth will become aware of this fact.</p>

          <h5>Oct 13, 2023 (1:18:33)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">We are not alone in the universe! In fact, the evidence 
          shows that Earth is being visited by a wide variety of humanoids. There are too many 
          cases to ignore. Here are fifteen accounts where people have had face-to-face encounters 
          with extraterrestrial humanoids. From the <b>1930s to the 2010s</b>, these cases come 
          from all over the world. They involve multiple eyewitnesses and are supported by 
          compelling evidence such as photographs, landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, 
          animal reactions and physiological effects. These cases have volumes to teach us about 
          the UFO phenomenon and the ET agenda on our planet.</p>
 
          <p><b>THE ALASKA ALIEN PHOTOGRAPH</b>. In the <b>early 1930s</b>, an anonymous man was
          hiking through the forest in Alaska and saw a strange humanoid figure. As the figure
          fled into the woods, the man chased it and managed to snap a very intriguing photograph.</p>

          <p><b>WARTIME UFO & HUMANOID</b>. One <b>night in Nov 1943</b>, Lavenia Sledge stepped 
          outside her home in Escondido, CA and saw a UFO with portholes hovering 15 feet above 
          her home. Inside she could see two humanoid figures. She called her husband and son, 
          who saw the object and figures.</p>

          <p><b>“THEY LOOKED HIDEOUS.”</b> It was <b>3:00am on Jul 3, 1955</b> as Margaret 
          Symmonds drove along Route 129 near Stockton, GA and saw four strange figures 
          standing in the road. As she drove by, she saw that they were not human. One of 
          them looked right at her.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE TREE</b>. When Hector Davis woke up in the middle of the night 
          on <b>Aug 25, 1968</b> while camping in Townsville, Australia, the last thing he 
          expected to see was a four-foot-tall humanoid wearing a one-piece gray uniform 
          standing in a tree looking down at him.</p>

          <p><b>“THEY ARE MARTIANS!”</b> When three teenagers became stranded in their car at a 
          reservoir near Trois Rivieres, Canada in <b>late Jul 1969</b>, they saw a glowing 
          saucer. To their intense fear, eight glowing humanoid figures exited and surrounded 
          their car, trying to get inside.</p>

          <p><b>“IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.”</b> On the <b>evening of Nov 22, 1973</b>, Mrs. JP of 
          Joliette, Canada woke up to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light shining in 
          through the window. Looking outside, she saw a beautiful humanoid figure staring back 
          at her. Meanwhile, other people in the area saw UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>THE DAW PARK HUMANOID</b>. <b>Late at night on May 30, 1976</b> Trevor White was 
          in his home in Daw Park, South Australia when his radio became staticky and the dog 
          outside began to bark. Looking out the window, he saw a humanoid in a silvery uniform 
          looking back at him, speaking a strange language.</p>

          <p><b>“IT WAS NOT HUMAN.”</b> When four men took a wrong turn while driving late at 
          <b>night on Jan 2, 1978</b> in Rainford, England, they were confronted by a 7-foot-tall 
          humanoid wearing a glowing spacesuit. When the spaceman began to walk towards them, the 
          men panicked. But the car wouldn’t start.</p>

          <p><b>“MY LIFE BECAME HELL.”</b> Around <b>9:00 pm on Sep 17, 1978</b>, Rivo Faralli 
          left his mother’s home in Torrita de Sienna Italy only to have a UFO drop down on the 
          road in front of him. Two short humanoids came out and began walking around his car. 
          They seemed more interested in his car, than in himself.</p>

          <p><b>THE SILVER MONSTERS</b>. On the <b>afternoon of Oct 2, 1978</b>, four young boys 
          hiking in the Groendal Nature Reserve in Rhodesia, Africa, were astonished to see a 
          landed UFO and three silver-uniformed humanoids walking by them. One carried a suitcase 
          like object. Another stopped and looked right at them.</p>

          <p><b>MONK-LIKE ALIENS</b>. On the <b>morning of Jun 20, 1986</b>, Cesar Locatelli was 
          out hunting bees near his home in Menetrux-en-Joux, France, but instead came upon a 
          landed flying saucer. The craft was transparent, and inside, he saw six hooded figures 
          studying something on a table. Then one turned in his direction.</p>

          <p><b>CAT-LIKE EXTRATERRESTRIALS</b>. On <b>Aug 31, 1987</b>, Randy Springsteen and 
          Dennis Mauer were playing on the swing-set by their home on the Bangor Naval Base in 
          Bremerton, Washington when a UFO appeared. Inside they saw cat-like humanoids. Then it 
          emitted a beam of light on them, lifting them off the swing.</p>

          <p><b>“I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SUCH BEINGS IN MY LIFE.”</b> At <b>12:30 am on Jul 9, 1996</b>, 
          police officers Marian Mancu and Marcel Rusu of Cercesti, Romania were shocked to see a 
          craft hover above the road. Out stepped three humanoids with elongated skulls.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE WHEAT FIELD</b>. Just <b>before dawn in Jun 2005</b>, a farmer was 
          bicycling to his mother’s farm in Scalenghe, Italy when he saw something strange: a tall 
          humanoid with bulging eyes standing next to a floating sphere. Frightened, he biked away 
          as fast as he could.</p>

          <p><b>“I WAS COMPLETELY FROZEN.”</b> On <b>Dec 29, 2013</b>, Madame L was petrified to 
          see a glowing saucer hovering over the garage of their home in St. Zenon, Canada. Two 
          weeks later, on Jan 14, her husband entered the garage and surprised a very unusual-looking 
          humanoid doing a very strange thing in his garage.</p>

          <p>Skeptics can no longer claim that there is no evidence. UFOs are real, and 
          extraterrestrials are watching over us very closely.</p>

          <h5>Oct 6, 2023 (1:15:33)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">So many UFO encounters! Each case adds to our knowledge of 
          UFO activity and the ET presence on our planet. This video presents ten unique UFO 
          stories from all over the world. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with 
          humanoids, and even one account of a little-known UFO crash. These cases provide 
          compelling evidence for the reality of the phenomenon. How many documented cases will 
          it take before humanity accepts the fact that we are not alone?</p>
          
          <p><b>BRITAIN’S EARLIEST HUMANOID?</b> In the <b>summer of 1901</b>, Frank (age 10) was 
          walking near his home in Bournbrook in West Midlands, England when he saw what looked 
          like a metal hut sitting in a field. Out stepped two short humanoids wearing gray 
          jumpsuits and helmets with antennae. One of the figures gestured for Frank to keep 
          back. With no idea of UFOs or ETs, it would be years before Frank understood what 
          happened.</p>

          <p><b>DEATH VALLEY UFO CRASH</b>. On <b>Aug 19, 1949</b> two prospectors, Buck 
          Fitzgerald (age 73) and his friend Mase Garney were in Death Valley when a silver 
          flying saucer zoomed overhead and crashed into the desert floor. Two short humanoids 
          jumped out, saw the prospectors, and took off running. Buck and Mase chased them, 
          but soon lost sight of them. Returning to the crash-site, the saucer was gone!</p>

          <p><b>CAUGHT IN THE SPOTLIGHT</b>. Around <b>7:00 pm on August 19, 1949</b>, Sgt. 
          Donald Berger shone an 8-million candlepower searchlight into the night skies of 
          Norwood, Ohio for a publicity stunt for a festival. To his and everyone’s amazement, 
          a glowing disc appeared in the searchlight beam. One month later, it happened again. 
          And over the next year, eight similar incidents followed. Something truly strange 
          was happening over Ohio.</p>

          <p><b>A FOILED ABDUCTION</b>. Early one <b>evening in June 1960</b>, the children of 
          Mr. and Mrs. LeMarquands were playing outside their home in Thompson in Manitoba, 
          Canada when a whirlwind began to swirl around them. Looking up, they saw a strange 
          craft. Then one of the children rose from the ground toward the UFO. One of the 
          neighborhood boys quickly grabbed the girl, preventing her from being pulled into 
          the craft.</p>

          <p><b>CHASED BY A UFO</b>. It was <b>5:00 pm, Aug 24, 1967</b> as Ron Hydes drove 
          his motorcycle south of Wodongo, Australia. Suddenly, a blinding light shone from 
          above. Stopping, Ron was amazed to see a metallic saucer landed along the road, 
          along with two silver-suited humanoids. One of them beckoned for him to approach. 
          Terrified, Ron hopped on his motorcycle and fled. To his dismay, the UFO began to 
          chase him.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE</b>. On a <b>Sunday afternoon in Oct 1974</b>, 
          Alain and Patrick were driving out of their hometown in Aisne, France and noticed five 
          very strange-looking short figures. They were four-feet-tall, wore robes, and had yellow 
          skin, long black hair and enormous round black eyes. One of the figures waved for the 
          two witnesses to come closer. Frightened, the witnesses drove off.</p>

          <p><b>“DON’T LET IT GET ME!”</b> Around <b>10:30 pm on Oct 28, 1976</b>, Richard Britt 
          and his son Richie returned to their home in Lake View, SC and saw a strange light 
          whizzing over the trees. Richard went inside, but Richie remained outside. Then the 
          light reappeared and suddenly zoomed forward, stopping only feet away from him. It was 
          a saucer and looking at him through a large porthole was a strange creature.</p>

          <p><b>THE ITALIAN ROBOT</b>. Around <b>midnight on Aug 31, 1977</b> and two students 
          were walking outside of Sturno, Italy and noticed some strange lights alongside the road. 
          Then they saw a giant silver robotic figure. They ran back to town and got more 
          witnesses. Frightened, all the witnesses fled and got even more witnesses, beginning 
          an encounter with a landed UFO and a silver humanoid that would leave the citizens of 
          the town in shock.</p>

          <p><b>THE ETS IN THE VILLAGE</b>. When night arrived on <b>Sep 1, 1978</b> in the small 
          village of Llanerchymedd, Wales, many residents of the town noticed a strange object in 
          the sky. Without warning, the object landed in a nearby field. Shortly later, three 
          humanoids exited and began to walk around. As more and more people in the town witnessed 
          the spectacle, panic swept through the town. Police were called. But the encounter 
          wasn’t over yet!</p>

          <p><b>THE SAUCER ON THE BACK PORCH</b>. Around <b>4:00 am on February 7, 1981</b>, Cindy 
          Gaffney was woken up in her home in San Francisco, California by a loud buzzing noise. To 
          her shock, she saw that a UFO had landed on her neighbor’s back porch. She woke up her 
          husband who also saw the craft. She called the police, but they didn’t believe her or 
          didn’t care.</p>

          <p>These ten truly strange UFO encounters are just a tiny sample of the huge number of 
          cases from all over the world. They show how complex the UFO phenomenon is, and the many 
          strange things that happen when ETs make contact with humans. The truth can no longer be 
          denied. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not the only intelligent beings living in 
          this universe, and many of them are regularly visiting our planet.</p>

          <h5>Sep 29, 2023 (1:02:32)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different kinds of UFO encounters. Sightings, 
          landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences, and more. Cases can be broken 
          down into categories such as close encounters of the first, second, third and fourth 
          kind. Then there are close encounters of the fifth kind, or human-initiated encounters. 
          This unique category can contain all the other types of encounters, but is 
          differentiated from them because the encounters themselves are the result of humans 
          reaching out to ETs. Cases like these are important because they show that humans can 
          develop an interactive relationship with the UFO phenomenon and the ETs. This video 
          presents three extensive true cases of CE-5 contact that go beyond simple sightings and 
          resulted in actual face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH</b>. In <b>Jun of 1996</b>, Jeneva Sterling drove to a 
          remote location in the mountains of Santa Clarita, CA to seek answers about the many 
          issues in her life. Depressed, she screamed out to the skies, “Why is life so crappy?! 
          Why am I here?!” At that moment, a brilliant light appeared behind and moved towards her. 
          Soon it was close enough to see it wasn’t any conventional craft. In fact, it was almost 
          totally silent. Then it hovered directly overhead and beamed her with light. Thinking 
          she was about to be abducted, Jeneva collapsed to the ground and trembled with fear. The 
          beam retracted, but the strange light stayed overhead, making a low buzzing noise.</p>
          
          <p>Jeneva had never been so scared in her life, but soon her fear began to pass, and the 
          object moved closer. Jeneva began to speak to it. Before long, her fear left and she realized 
          that the UFO was not going to hurt her. In fact, the whole experience became deeply 
          moving and spiritually transformative. The object remained there all night long, 
          communing with Jeneva and totally lifting her out of her depression. When sunrise came, 
          the UFO zoomed off. Jeneva, however, was forever changed. She became interested in UFOs 
          and remote viewing, and began having vivid dreams of being onboard a UFO. And then, one 
          day, the UFO returned.</p>

          <p><b>A LOVE LIKE NEVER BEFORE</b>. Hector Sawiak had never seen a UFO. But in <b>Mar 2015</b>, 
          he heard about sightings near his home in San Juan, Argentina. He decided to go out 
          hiking and try to have an encounter. Unfortunately, nothing showed up. But that night, 
          after going to bed, he woke up to hear his name being called in his head. He jumped up 
          and went to the window in time to see a brilliant UFO streak across the sky. He was 
          amazed. Had the UFO occupants woken him up to show their craft? A few months later, 
          Hector was asleep in bed when the room filled with light. Waking up, he was terrified to 
          see two tall ETs standing in the doorway. They were slender, with dark eyes and large 
          bald heads, and wore olive-green jumpsuits. “Don’t be afraid,” they said. “We are not 
          going to hurt you.” Hector’s fear evaporated and instead, he felt “a love like never 
          before.” One of the ETs approached his bedside and said, “I have come to heal you.” 
          Hector cried with intense joy and gratitude as the ETs gave him a tiny pill and told 
          him to swallow it. The next thing he knew, it was morning. Hector knew his life would 
          never be the same.</p>

          <p><b>IN THE COMPANY OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS</b>. In <b>Apr 2015</b>, 14-year-old Abdiel saw 
          the TV show, Hangar One, all about UFOs. The subject immediately intrigued him. UFOs were 
          real? He could hardly believe it. If they were real, he thought, he wanted to see one. 
          One week later, he was in his backyard in Puerto Rico, when a bright light caught his eye, 
          a golden-yellow object was moving across the sky. It was a UFO! Abdiel was amazed. He had 
          expressed a desire to see a UFO one week earlier, and then one had appeared. That 
          couldn’t be a coincidence. Before long he had another sighting. This was followed by 
          weird knocks on the window of his home. Shortly later, he was amazed to see a strange 
          circle in his backyard, just as if a UFO had landed there.</p>
          
          <p>Later he found another strange mark in the grass that looked like an ET head. Could 
          the ETs be trying to contact with him? A few days later, Abdiel got his answer. Going 
          into his backyard to inspect the marks on his lawn, he was shocked to observe a strange 
          humanoid run across his yard. It was short, brown in color, with a large triangular-shaped 
          bald head and big, dark, round eyes. It was an ET. Soon, more sightings would follow, and 
          this time, his camera was ready.</p>

          <p>These three cases all qualify as close encounters of the 5th kind. In each case, 
          people reached out to the ETs and received a dramatic unmistakable response. These cases 
          show just how closely ETs are watching over all of us, and that if a person asks for 
          contact, they can initiate their own encounter and experience the UFO phenomenon 
          firsthand. These three cases are covered in detail in my book,

          FIVE TRUE CASES</a></h2>

          <h5>Sep 22, 2023 (1:04:58)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is perhaps the ultimate UFO encounter: being taken onboard 
          a UFO. Unlike sightings, landings and face-to-face encounters, witnesses find themselves 
          in a totally alien environment. The floor, the walls, the ceiling – everything around 
          them is extraterrestrial, including the beings themselves. An onboard experience is the 
          most extensive of all UFO encounters. They contain more data than any other encounter 
          (except for perhaps a UFO crash/retrieval,) and often involve significant interaction and 
          communication between the experiencer and the ETs themselves. These are the cases that 
          have volumes to teach us about extraterrestrial contact. Here are five cases of onboard 
          experiences. These cases provide significant evidence pointing towards the reality of 
          UFOs and the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF JOYCE UPDIKE</b>. In <b>Aug 1967</b>, Joyce Updike 
          was cleaning her home in Platte, NB, late at night when the room filled with light. What 
          seemed like moments later, she woke up in bed, only to find that hours had passed. 
          Afterward, her husband found a circle of burned grass outside. Joyce had sore eyes, and 
          some of her hair began to fall out. She became interested in UFOs, ancient civilizations, 
          past-lives, and more. She began to have telepathy and poltergeist activity. Years later, 
          she heard about UFOs and missing time, and realized that this is what she had experienced. 
          Going under hypnosis, she recalled a long onboard encounter with human-like ETs who 
          examined her and gave her messages about the future of Earth.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF ALEJANDRA MARTINEZ DE PASCUCCI</b>. It was <b>Jul 2, 
          1968</b>, and Alejandra was walking to her home in Quilmes, Argentina when she was overcome 
          by a strange magnetic force. Unable to move or cry out, the next thing she knew, she was 
          lying down on a table onboard a UFO. The interior was white, spotless, with rounded walls. 
          Beside her were two tall figures wearing glowing uniforms. While they looked human, 
          Alejandra could see that they were “not from Earth.” They seemed to gesture to each other 
          as they maneuvered the craft. Consumed with fear, Alejandra was ejected from the craft in 
          a different location. Later, weird landing traces would provide more evidence of her 
          encounter.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF JUDY KENDALL</b>. Around <b>6:00 pm on Nov 26, 1972</b>, 
          Judy Kendall and her two sisters drove home from Zamora to Bodega Bay, CA, a two-hour trip. 
          They were crossing the Cache Creek Bridge when the car felt weirdly cold, and an odd 
          tiredness swept over them. They missed their exit only to find themselves crossing the 
          same bridge twice! When they arrived home, more than four hours had passed. Their parents 
          had called the police. Years later, Judy recalled her missing time event and underwent
          hypnosis. She recalled that her car had been lifted up from the highway and into a UFO. 
          She was taken into a room and underwent a physical examination at the hands of small 
          beings, one human-looking figure and a terrifying insectoid ET.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF KAREN LYSTER</b>. It was a <b>Friday night in Jan 
          1978</b> as Karen Lyster looked out the window of her hotel in Sydney, Australia to 
          see a glowing object hovering outside. The next thing she knew, it was Sunday morning, 
          and she was waking up in bed. She was missing more than a day of time. She later suddenly
          remembered that she had been pulled into the UFO and confronted by six beautiful people 
          with dark hair, blue eyes, and flawless skin. They wanted to do tests on her hands, they
          said. Later, she was left alone in a weird round room. Karen decided to explore the 
          craft. She walked down the hallway to another room where the walls turned transparent 
          and revealed a field of stars. This was the latest of many encounters in her life.</p>

          <p><b>THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF ANTONIO NELSO TASCA</b>. On <b>December 13, 1986</b>,
          real-estate agent Antonio Nelso Tasca was driving on a dirt road outside of Chapeco, 
          Brazil when he came upon a huge craft blocking the road. It struck him with a beam of 
          light and pulled him inside. Antonio was examined by strange ETs and then was put into
          another room and undressed. A beautiful female humanoid entered and seduced him. After 
          the two had an intimate encounter, she gave Antonio a long warning and a message for 
          all humanity about the future of the planet and the need for radical change of society. 
          Afterward, Antonio was dropped miles from the original location, with a large unexplained
           scar on his body. His case would become one of the best-verified in his country.</p>

          <p>These five cases reveal many of the strange procedures that occur when people are 
          taken onboard a UFO. They involve a wide variety of ET types and show how ET contact 
          can affect a person profoundly in different ways. These cases also provide substantial
          evidence of the reality of UFOs, including landing traces, medical evidence, and
          electromagnetic effects. They also show that onboard encounters are occurring all over 
          the world, and likely in large numbers. We are not alone!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">What is it like to see an alien, to have a face-to-face 
          encounter with an actual extraterrestrial? An experience like this often affects the 
          witnesses on multiple levels, challenging them mentally, physically, emotionally, and 
          spiritually. It is a superlative experience that leaves them changed forever. Here are 
          ten cases coming from across the world, spanning five decades, involving close-up 
          encounters with strange humanoids. These cases provide profound insights into the nature 
          of ET contact. They also contain compelling evidence of UFO reality.</p>

          <p><b>THE QUIZZICAL ALIEN</b>. <b>May 1957</b>, Frances Sticler was working on her farm 
          in Milford, PA when she heard a loud whirring sound and sees a bowl-shaped craft approach 
          and hover a mere 15 feet over her barn. The craft tilted towards her and to her amazement, 
          she saw a humanoid looking down at her with a strange expression on his face.</p>

          <p><b>IT WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE</b>. It was <b>5:30 a.m., on Jul 13, 1959</b>, when 
          Eileen Moreland was working on her farm in Blenheim, NZ. Looking up, she saw a circular 
          craft zooming down towards her. It hovered a short distance away, sending out waves of 
          heat. Inside she saw two humanoid figures. One stood up and appeared to look down at her. 
          It was an experience which would have huge repercussions for years to come.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO HEADACHE</b>. On the night of <b>July 26</b>, Adilson Batista Azevedo (age 
          14) joined his two friends to watch a movie at a theater in Carazinho, Brazil. On their 
          way, a UFO swooped down and hovered overhead. Adilson’s friends fled in fear. But Adilson 
          stayed to watch as first one craft and then another landed in the field next to him. Then 
          out came short humanoid figures. Adilson approached closer and saw things that would affect 
          him for the rest of his life.</p>

          <p><b>THEY WERE NOT HUMAN</b>. On the morning of <b>Aug 13, 1965</b>, Ellen Grace Ryerson 
          and her sister, Laura Jean were working in a bean field along Russel Road near their home 
          in Renton, WA, when they saw two humanoid figures. The sisters approached and were shocked 
          to see that the figures had grey skin, bulging frog-like eyes, and wore strange outfits. 
          They were not human!</p>

          <p><b>IT KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW</b>. On the evening of <b>Jul 12, 1968</b>, five children 
          saw a UFO hovering near their home in Saint Stanislas-of-Kostka in Quebec, Canada. Running 
          outside, they saw a short humanoid with a face like a frog. The children panicked and ran 
          back inside. Later, they would find physical evidence in the form of landing traces.</p>

          <p><b>I KNOW WHAT I SAW</b>. It was an early fall morning in Summit County, UT, when Lennis 
          Gines and her son Sam saw a UFO hovering only a few feet above the ground 450 feet from 
          their home. It remained in place for more than 45 minutes before Sam went outside to 
          confront them. That’s when he saw the strange humanoids coming in and out of the craft.</p>

          <p><b>WE WERE FRIGHTENED AND FASCINATED</b>. <b>Mar 28, 1973</b>, Clyde Donahower, his 
          wife and their 8-year-old son saw a UFO near their home in Robesonia, PA. Inside they 
          could see the silhouette of a humanoid figure busily moving around. When the craft 
          remained for almost an hour, they decided to call the police.</p>

          <p><b>I FELT A COLD SWEAT</b>. It was a normal evening at work in a factory at Meylan, 
          France when Julien Hermann received the shock of his life: a sparkling, glowing, green, 
          humanoid figure stood outside his office window, only 50 feet away. At the same time, 
          his radio filled with static. He ran outside to get a closer look.</p>

          <p><b>TWO THINGS CAME DOWN</b>. It was the middle of the night when teenager, Deanne Kerns 
          saw a grayish saucer sending down a beam of light near her home in Ord, NE. Suddenly, two 
          strange beings with arms like tentacles appeared in the beam, levitated down to the ground, 
          and began picking vegetation and taking soil samples.</p>

          <p><b>TWO LITTLE MEN CAME OUT</b>. It was early <b>evening in 1990</b> when goat-herder, 
          Flores de Mamani and her dog were taking her goats to her home in Tucuman, Argentina, home 
          and suddenly they all became paralyzed. A large spherical object appeared overhead and out 
          came two small humanoids who walked up to Flores and took a blood sample. The other 
          approached her goat and did something she could hardly believe.</p>

          <p>These ten cases are only a small sampling of the huge number of humanoid encounters 
          that are occurring across this planet. The time for skepticism is over. Governments 
          across the world are admitting to the reality of the ET presence on our planet. The 
          evidence is undeniable. We are being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrials. 
          And it is the humanoid cases that reveal why they are here and their agenda on our planet.</p>

          THE FRENCH UFO<br>
          WAVE OF 1954:<br>
          THE HUMANOIDS</a></h2>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Nothing like it had ever happened before. And it would never 
          happen again. The French UFO wave of <b>1954</b> was unprecedented. Starting in early 
          <b>September of 1954</b>, hundreds, if not thousands of UFO encounters swept across the 
          country of France with incredible fury. For the next two months, encounters occurred 
          daily, often multiple accounts each day. These were not just sightings, but landings 
          and face-to-face encounters with humanoids of all kinds. Witnesses included people from 
          all walks of life: farmers, teachers, housewives, business-owners, government officials, 
          children, even entire families.</p>
          
          <p>As the activity mounted, so did the fear. People were afraid to go outside at night. 
          Others began to arm themselves for protection, sometimes attacking neighbors or passersby 
          thinking they were “Martians!” Skeptics and debunkers became overwhelmed, unable to explain 
          away the experiences. The press went wild, unable to keep up with the huge onslaught of 
          cases. Day after day, people reported UFOs flying overhead, landing next to their homes, 
          blocking the roads. The sightings are incredible enough. But most interesting are the 
          cases involving humanoids.</p>

          <p>This video presents a day-by-day accounting of more than fifty humanoid encounters in 
          the months of <b>September and October 1954</b> alone. ETs coming out of their craft, 
          collecting plants and animals, approaching terrified citizens, and in some cases 
          communicating with them in various ways. The cases provide nearly the entire gamut of 
          physical evidence with many producing landing traces, animal reactions, weird medical 
          effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more.</p>

          <p>The question is, why? Why did this super-wave of such unparalleled ferocity strike 
          France? Why France? Why <b>September and October of 1954?</b> Why so many landings and 
          humanoids? Were they looking for something? Was this a display designed to convince the 
          citizens of the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials?</p>

          <p>An examination and analysis of these cases reveals some remarkable insights. One thing 
          is clear: something very profound happened during these sixty days, something that would 
          forever change the way the entire world viewed the UFO phenomenon. The wave would inspire 
          researchers like Aime Michel and Jacques Vallee and many others to research the UFO 
          phenomenon and produce books and articles about the amazing wave of activity. There may 
          have been some very profound and important reasons for one of the most intense UFO waves 
          in all of human history.</p>

          <h5>Sep 1, 2023 (1:09:35)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There’s nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a 
          humanoid. These cases are the heart of the UFO phenomenon. They are the cases that teach 
          us the most about extraterrestrial contact. They’re also the most interesting. This video 
          presents ten cases that span five decades and come from all over the world. They present 
          nearly the entire range of UFO evidence, including multiple eyewitness testimony, medical 
          effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic interference, landing traces and more. They 
          show how many different ET-types there are, and answer many of the questions surrounding 
          the UFO phenomenon: who the ETs are, where do they come from, and why are they visiting 
          our planet?</p>

          <p><b>“THEY WERE VERY GOOD-LOOKING.”</b> One <b>summer evening in 1946</b>, Vida Goldsworthy 
          and her sister were walking their dog in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa when they saw a 
          huge craft hovering above a nearby hotel. To their amazement, two tall ETs came out and 
          looked down at them. Vida was impressed by how beautiful they were. It was one of South 
          Africa’s first recorded humanoid encounters.</p>

          <p><b>“WE COME FROM CASSIOPEIA.”</b> In <b>Sep 1955</b>, Joseph Wanderka rode his moped 
          through a forest path in Arbesthal, Austria, and came upon a landed UFO. Going onboard, 
          he met six child-like human-looking ETs. He told them about the many problems of Earth 
          society and asked if they could intervene. They told him that although they had long since 
          moved past wars, disease and corruption that no, they couldn’t intervene, and that Earth 
          people had to solve their own problems.</p>

          <p><b>ALIENS GO CAMPING</b>. On <b>Mar 10, 1961</b>, Mr. Reynolds and his son went camping 
          at Bowna Reserve in Albury, NSW, Australia and saw what they first thought were other 
          campers. They saw strange figures and a vehicle of some kind. When it suddenly disappeared 
          without a trace, they knew they had seen something very strange. They soon learned that 
          many people in the area had seen unusual UFO activity.</p>

          <p><b>ANOTHER HITCHHIKING ALIEN</b>. On the <b>night of Aug 27, 1972</b>, Eduardo Dedeu was 
          driving between Medanos and Bahia Blanca, Argentina, when he picked up a hitchhiker. He was 
          fascinated to see that the man had an abnormally long face and huge chin. He did not look 
          human. Then the car engine failed, and he came upon a UFO landed on the highway. His 
          mysterious passenger exited, and the UFO took off, leaving Eduardo shocked to the core.</p>

          <p><b>THE LE BIHAN FAMILY UFO ORDEAL</b>. On <b>Sep 29, 1974</b>, the Le Bihan family of 
          Riec-Sur-Belon, France was amazed to see a giant UFO hovering near their home. Three glowing 
          figures came out and began to march towards them. Terrified, the Le Bihans fled their home. 
          Unknown to them, their neighbors were also experiencing weird activity. It was an encounter 
          that would affect them all for a long time.</p>

          <p><b>HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SAW IT</b>. On <b>Jun 22, 1976</b>, hundreds of residents of the 
          Canary Islands witnessed one of the most dramatic UFO displays on record in their country.
          One or more UFOs flitted around in the sky for nearly an hour. Some residents saw the UFOs 
          very close up, close enough to see two extremely tall ETs dressed in red jumpsuits looking 
          down at them from above.</p>

          <p><b>THE FLYING HUMANOID</b>. On <b>Jul 12, 1977</b>, Adrian de Olmos of Quebradillas, 
          Puerto Rico was puzzled to see a child-sized figure wearing a strange jumpsuit approach the 
          front of his home. He called his family and the neighbors, and they all watched this short 
          humanoid fly around among the trees near their homes. It caused a near panic in the town, 
          and even the animals were acting crazed.</p>

          <p><b>MISSING TIME ON THE TUG FORK RIVER</b>. On the night of <b>Jun 14, 1978</b>, teenagers 
          Bryan Duty and John Wright when fishing near their home in Naugatuck, WV. Although they 
          caught no fish, they did see a UFO which struck them with a beam of light. They were unable 
          to move and the next thing they knew, they were running home. Both had vague memories of 
          being taken onboard the craft.</p>

          <p><b>ENCOUNTER ON THE MOUNTAIN</b>. On <b>Oct 3, 1978</b>, Hideichi Amano was playing with 
          his ham radio on top of a mountain near Sayama City, Japan. Suddenly his car blazed with 
          light. The engine died, and then suddenly a weird humanoid appeared and pressed a strange 
          device against his head. For several moments, Hideichi remained paralyzed. Finally, the 
          humanoid departed and Hideichi fled the area. But he would never be the same again.</p>

          <p><b>THE ET IN THE CORNFIELD</b>. On <b>July 23, 1982</b>, three teenagers were camping 
          in a cornfield near Sainte-Dorethee, Quebec, Canada when a UFO appeared overhead. Shortly 
          after it left, a tall humanoid appeared near their tent, frightening them so badly, they 
          ran away, leaving everything behind. Unknown to them, another nearby witness was watching 
          the whole thing.</p>

          <p>These ten cases reveal the startling complexity of the UFO phenomenon and provide 
          compelling evidence for the reality of extraterrestrial visitations. They provide another 
          piece of the UFO puzzle and remind us all that we are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Aug 25, 2023 (0:48:43)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">One puzzling enigma of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation 
          of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Blue Beings…the list is 
          endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world report many 
          supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes…little people of all kinds. Could some of 
          these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? 
          There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are many reports 
          like this, and it's still going on today! This video presents ten cases of people who have 
          encountered little people which might be either an elf or alien!</p>

          <p><b>AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND</b>. In <b>1885</b>, a lady was picking berries in the 
          forest near her home in when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing 
          nearby was an elf-like creature holding an axe. The woman fled the area. She returned later 
          with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY</b>. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in <b>August 
          of 1942</b> when one afternoon, he heard someone tapping on the window. He was amazed to see 
          a tiny man only with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray 
          shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. 
          Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.</p>

          <p><b>MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND</b>. In <b>1945</b>, Galen Sharp was five years old when an elf 
          appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man had large eyes, a rounded nose, and a 
          bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark pants and leather shoes. He introduced himself to 
          Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared many times, shared special 
          stories with him and performed playful antics to make Galen laugh.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA</b>. On <b>Christmas morning in 1957</b>, a seven-year-old 
          boy woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. 
          The witness was “frozen” in bed. He wanted to jump up and investigate but couldn't move. Then 
          he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” When morning arrived, the 
          boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!</p>

          <p><b>THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX</b>. One cold <b>morning in 1976</b> a lady exited her 
          home in Appleby, TX. To her shock, a tall, winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, 
          and gray skin sat on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. 
          Suddenly it blazed with light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light 
          and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange, burned spot on her bench.</p>

          <p><b>THE GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO</b>. One <b>afternoon in 1986</b>, a man was 
          digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about 
          20 feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather 
          suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for ten minutes, until 
          a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away.</p>

          <p><b>A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO</b>. It was <b>10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989</b>, 
          when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap. Turning, 
          he saw a short, fat, dwarf with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. He wore green 
          overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted 
          behind a tree. Two weeks earlier, a family in the area saw the same figure.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM</b>. One <b>summer morning in 1997</b>, a lady 
          exited her yard when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had 
          bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. 
          The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was 
          gone.</p>

          <p><b>AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY</b>. One day around dusk in <b>Summer 
          2002</b>, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal 
          when he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf 
          was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see 
          him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.</p>

          <p><b>THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY</b>. On <b>Jun 24, 2003</b>, a man 
          was canoeing along the river. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two 
          little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. 
          They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. 
          Soon more appeared.</p>

          <p>These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know 
          about Earth, the ET presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. If 
          you’d like to hear more about some of the little people stories presented here, and

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are all kinds of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, 
          onboard experiences and more. Then there are the cases involving animals. In fact, one 
          of the categories of UFO evidence involves animal reactions, and there are many examples. 
          Much rarer are cases where weird things happen to animals. This video presents eight 
          cases in which weird things happen to animals during UFO encounter. These cases involve 
          the entire range of UFO encounters and a wide variety of animals. These cases span six 
          decades, involve many witnesses, and come from all over the world. And all of them are 
          just a bit weird!</p>

          <p><b>THE FLOATING HORSE</b>. On <b>Oct 16, 1954</b>, Guy Puyfourcat led his mare to his 
          home in Cier-de-Riviere, France. His horse got spooked and glanced to the right. Guy saw 
          three figures dart into the bushes. He then heard a shrieking sound as a small, gray, 
          saucer-shaped craft rose 150 feet, then moved toward him and stopped briefly, at which 
          point his horse levitated 9 feet into the air. The craft darted away, and his horse 
          dropped, temporarily paralyzed. After 10 minutes, it got up, sweaty and trembling.</p>

          <p><b>THE PARALYZED DOG</b>. On <b>Oct 17, 1954</b>, Maxime Pignatelli was hunting with 
          his dog along the Durance River near Corbieres, France. Looking ahead of him, he saw a 
          12-foot-wide black oval object on the ground. On top was a dome, and inside he saw two 
          child-like beings. The two figures exited the craft. Maxime’s dog ran toward them, but 
          Maxime panicked, falling into a ditch. His dog came crawling back, howling and dragging 
          its back legs. As they fled, Maxime felt a wave of tiredness come over him.</p>

          <p><b>THE SHEEP SLAUGHTERING ALIEN</b>. One night in <b>1968</b> Valentina Flores of Otoco, 
          Bolivia, was herding her lamas into their pens when she noticed saw that strange netting 
          had been placed over it and a 4-foot-tall humanoid was inside, using a tube-like instrument 
          to kill her sheep. She threw rocks at him. He responded by throwing his hooked instrument 
          at her which cut her arms and returned to his hand like a boomerang. The figure grabbed the 
          netting, rose into the air and disappeared. Valentina saw that 34 sheep had been killed.</p>

          <p><b>GOAT KIDNAPPED BY ETS</b>. On <b>Sep 22, 1972</b>, a peasant woman from Villa 
          Altagracia in the Dominican Republic was shocked to see a strange craft covered with 
          lights landed on the ground. Out came two short beings who proceeded to grab a goat. 
          The goat seemed to be paralyzed as the two short beings carried it into the craft, 
          which took off at great speed and disappeared from sight.</p>

          <p><b>CAN WE HAVE FOUR OF YOUR RABBITS?</b> On the night of <b>Aug 17, 1977</b>, Marco 
          Antonio de la Cuadra woke up in his home in Alto Jahuel, Chile. An odd buzzing sound was 
          coming from his rabbit hutch. Going outside, he came upon an oval object landed on the 
          ground. In front of it was a human-looking male with blond hair wearing a tight-fitting 
          white suit. The man said he was part of a scientific exploration looking for new species to 
          help re-populate his planet. He wanted fish. Marco said he had no fish, but he did have 
          rabbits.</p>

          <p><b>THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE CHICKENS</b>. On the night on <b>Mar 3, 1980</b>, Vivian 
          Rodriguez woke up to her dogs barking and a commotion on the porch of their home in Rio 
          Piedras, Puerto Rico. Looking outside, she saw 5 short humanoids searching the porch. She 
          woke up her brother, Jose, and they watched as the beings showed a great interest in their 
          chickens. The figures fled when a car approached. Unknown to the siblings, only a few miles 
          away, two men saw the same figures climb into a landed UFO which took off over the city.</p>

          <p><b>I SAW A DOLPHIN ONBOARD A UFO</b>. In <b>Jan 1981</b>, a woman and her mother were 
          driving on a highway in Manchester, England when suddenly there were no other cars. They 
          saw a strange light ahead of them and noticed an old-fashioned car. Suddenly the car turned 
          into a UFO, which disappeared. Getting home, they noticed that they were missing 2 hours. 
          Under hypnosis, the witness recalled being taken onboard the craft where she saw a human-
          looking ET. He led her into a room where there was a small pool and a sick dolphin.</p>

          <p><b>PIG-SNATCHING ALIENS</b>. In the wee hours of the morning of <b>Sep 12, 2006</b>, 
          Evan Briese of Tappen, ND woke up and saw something in their pig corral. Thinking it 
          was a coyote, he grabbed his rifle. To his shock, he saw two 8-foot-tall beings stealing 
          their pregnant sow. Evan fired his gun. One of the beings screamed while the other flew 
          towards him and knocked him unconscious. Upon awakening, Evan saw that his shirt was 
          ripped to shreds and the pregnant sow was gone. And this was just the beginning.</p>

          <p>These cases reveal an alien agenda that includes a strong interest in animals of all 
          kinds, and that ETs can affect animals in ways we are only beginning to understand. 
          Whether it’s levitating a horse, paralyzing a dog, killing sheep or taking rabbits and 
          pigs, the ETs are visiting many locations all across are planet, and have been doing so 
          for decades.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The UFO phenomenon is one of the most persistent and perplexing 
          mysteries of modern times. But is it still fair to call it a mystery? Or do we know what 
          UFOs are? Sightings can be misidentified. But when someone experiences a landed UFO and 
          humanoids, the chances of misperception are negligible. These cases make it very clear that 
          we are dealing with humanoids, people like us, but from beyond Earth. These are the cases 
          which teach us the most about the UFO phenomenon, how it manifests, where ETs come from, 
          why they are here, and their agenda on this planet. These five cases, spanning many decades, 
          and coming from across the planet, answer many of the questions surrounding this subject, 
          and show just how amazing and transformative UFO contact can be.</p>

          <p><b>TURKEY’S FIRST UFO CONTACTEE</b>. In <b>December of 1948</b>, Behcet Ocal was only 
          15 years old when he became a UFO contactee. He was shepherding sheep near his home in 
          Nigde, Turkey, and a glowing UFO dropped down and landed next to him. Out stepped three 
          unusual humanoids, two males and a female, who told him not to be afraid, and that they 
          would be contacting him in the future. One of them reached out and touched his shoulder, 
          causing him to pass out. In the days and weeks that followed, Behcet was visited many 
          times and given profound information about the nature of the universe.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN IN THE FACTORY</b>. One of the most amazing humanoid encounters in UFO 
          history occurred at the Ika-Renault Factory in Santa Isabel, Argentina. On the <b>morning 
          of September 21, 1972</b>, factory janitor Teodoro Merlo opened the company washrooms and 
          was puzzled to find one of the lights burned out and the room unnaturally hot. Then 
          looking at one of the washbasins, he was shocked to see a 7-foot-tall humanoid figure 
          looking at him. One day later, another factory worker, Enrique Moreno was delivering 
          papers when he came upon the same humanoid, causing his 3-wheeler to malfunction. Later, 
          he would see the figure again. The next day, another employee, a truck driver had an 
          encounter with the same being. Unknown to any of them, multiple workers and even people 
          outside the factory also saw the humanoid and UFOs too.</p>

          <p><b>THE SIDEWAYS ALIEN</b>. It was the <b>middle of the night in December 1993</b>, and 
          Monsieur VM of Vilvoorde, Belgium woke up to relieve himself. He noticed an eerie green 
          light shining in through the kitchen window, and looked outside, was shocked to see a 
          short humanoid figure wearing a helmet and jumpsuit walking through his yard. The witness 
          shone his flashlight at the being, which turned around, gestured at him, then proceeded 
          to walk sideways up the 9-foot-tall brick-wall in the backyard. Moments later, a glowing 
          craft with a transparent dome rose from behind the wall and hovered for several minutes, 
          before darting away. Nobody else saw the event, but VM had encounters both before and 
          after this, and both times, he did have witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>“THEY WALKED LIKE ROBOTS”</b> On the <b>evening of May 27, 1977</b>, three 
          14-year-old boys were hiking in the fields near their homes in West Pittsburg, CA. 
          Without warning, a massive craft with red lights and portholes darted back and forth 
          and then landed right next to them. Then three tall shadowy beings exited and began to 
          walk towards them. The boys fled the scene. To their shock, the entities followed them, 
          chasing them at high speed for several blocks through the suburbs. The encounter 
          attracted leading researchers, such as J. Allen Hynek, who called it one of the most 
          credible humanoid reports of the year.</p>

          <p><b>TWELVE BEINGS APPEARED</b>. It was a <b>late August night in 1979</b> when Carol 
          X, a resident of Gateshead, England noticed a strange orange light shining in through 
          the window. Parting the curtains, she saw a brightly lit craft hovering near her home. 
          It darted away, but moments later, a tiny UFO entered her bedroom and released a swarm 
          of tiny lights which descended upon her. It was the beginning of a series of strange 
          events, including an incredible visitation by a dozen short humanoids which crowded into 
          her bedroom, and were soon seen by other family members. Then the high strangeness 
          continued to escalate.</p>

          <p>So many people all over the world having extensive encounters with ETs. The coverup 
          is ending. Disclosure is happening. The time for skepticism is over. The truth of the 
          ET presence can no longer be denied. Now it’s time to accept the fact that we are not 
          alone and try to determine how we can engage with these visitors to our planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Among the most fascinating and extensive cases of UFO contact 
          are landings and face-to-face encounters with humanoids. These accounts have volumes to 
          teach us about the ETs, who they are, why they are here, and their agenda on our planet.
          This video presents five fascinating cases of UFO contact, each providing some 
          profound and unique insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN WITH THE BEAMING SPHERE</b>. Late at <b>night on June 14, 1968</b>, 
          Pedro Jacobo Pretzel of Villa Carlos Paz, Argentina, drove up to the Motel La Cuesta 
          (which he owned) and saw two hovering red lights. He didn’t think much of. Going inside, 
          he found his daughter, Maria, kneeling on the floor, babbling about a strange man. Maria 
          had an amazing story to tell. She said that a tall blond man in a shiny blue jumpsuit 
          had entered the motel and confronted her. He held a weird glowing sphere in his hand, 
          which caused odd sensations in her body. “Don’t be afraid,” he said. Then he pointed 
          a beam of light at her, causing her to float slowly to the ground. It was just the 
          beginning of a complicated interaction with an ET. It was a case which would go all 
          the way to the Argentine Air Force.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS ON THE MOUNTAINTOP</b>. Around <b>8:30 pm, on October 19, 1973</b>, 
          Gabriel Demogue and his girlfriend took his motorcycle up Malmont Mountain near 
          Draguignan, France. When she saw a UFO pacing them, she insisted they turn around, 
          which they did. Returning to town, Gabriel told his friends what happened. Four of 
          them decided to return to the mountain in two cars and investigate. To their shock, 
          they came upon a UFO landed on top of the mountain, out of which came three ET figures. 
          Two of the men fled in their car, while the other two found that their car’s engine 
          failed. While trying to get away, they had repeated sightings of the ETs. Meanwhile, 
          the friends who had fled the scene also saw the ETs crossing the road in front of them.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN ON LONGFORD ROAD</b>. It was a <b>late August afternoon in 1976</b> 
          when three 10-year-old children, Susan and John Harris, and their friend Paul Smith 
          went to play outside their homes on Longford Road West in Reddish, England. Susan went 
          inside to get some juice. That’s when the boys heard a strange sound, saw a flash of 
          light, and a human-looking ET dressed in a silver jumpsuit floated out of the bushes 
          nearby. Moments later, he disappeared. Back in the house, Susan looked out the window 
          and the same ET looking right at her. He turned, bent down and started taking soil 
          samples from the ground. Susan screamed and the man disappeared. Running outside, she 
          met with the boys and together they saw the strange man again. And shortly later, a 
          flying saucer rose up from the field.</p>

          <p><b>THE SOUTH MIDDLETON ALIENS</b>. On the <b>evening of January 7, 1978</b>, Theresa 
          Gould saw a bright object land behind her home in South Middleton, Massachusetts. She 
          called a friend and strangely, the phonelines went dead. Unknown to her, Theresa’s relatives 
          were trying to call. Her 14-year-old son, Douglas, had gone to sleep over and a strange 
          glowing man appeared in the children’s bedroom. The father thought it was their imagination, 
          until he saw the figure himself. The next day, Theresa’s husband, Thomas, was cutting wood 
          on their property when he saw the same figure. He had seen it several times over the last 
          month and tried to chase it down. He could never catch it, so this time, he just watched it. 
          After an hour, it disappeared. Thomas drove near his home and came upon a landed UFO. He 
          told his family, The next day when the UFO landed again. Soon everyone in the family began 
          seeing the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIENS BY THE BOBR RIVER</b>. Around <b>dusk on July 8 or 9, 1990</b>, Ryszard 
          P parked his car along the Bobr River. Walking into the woods, he heard a strange sound 
          and smelled an odd burning odor. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a huge silver 
          object landed by the river. Inside a window of the craft, he saw two humanoids. But 
          outside, he saw more than a dozen of the short figures. They wore helmets with white 
          faceplates and mummy-like green uniforms. Their arms flexed in both directions, but their 
          legs seemed bound together. The beings jumped around like kangaroos. Each held a tubelike 
          device in their hands, which they were using to test or measure the vegetation. Ryszard 
          watched in awe, and then he coughed. At that moment, he lost all awareness. He woke up, 
          still standing, but found that an hour had passed. The craft and the beings were gone, 
          but the effects on Ryszard had only just begun.</p>

          <p>These five cases show how UFO encounters can be both strikingly similar and 
          incredibly different. The shapes of the UFO craft show great variation. And the 
          different types of ETs. But each involves unknown craft and face-to-face encounters 
          with humanoids. These kinds of cases make it clear that we are not alone, that people 
          all over the planet are being visited by many different kinds of extraterrestrials.</p>

          HIGH STRANGENESS</a></h2>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO encounters are known for high strangeness. Sightings, 
          landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences – all often contain bizarre 
          aspects that defy explanation. The question is, why? Is this an intentional act on the 
          part of the ETs to encourage us to seek new answers? Here are 10 weird UFO cases of 
          extreme high strangeness that might help answer these questions.</p>

          <p><b>WEIRD EFFECTS FROM A UFO</b>. In <b>Nov 1953</b>, Trygve Jansen and Gudrun Buflod 
          drove along the Mossevei Road by Gjresjoen Lake in Norway. Suddenly a UFO dropped from 
          the sky, swooped at their car and blocked their path on the road. After a short stand-off, 
          the object flew away. The weirdness wasn't over. The UFO affected the watch Trygve wore, 
          the car he was driving, and caused strange physiological changes in both witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO IN DISGUISE</b>. On <b>Jul 2, 1954</b>, Mrs. R and 8 family members drove 
          along Highway 97 near Crater Lake, OR. Low on gas, they decided to stop at the next 
          gas/food stop. Up ahead, they saw a brightly-lit café all by itself by the highway. 
          Their car died and they rolled into the parking lot. The building was round and covered 
          with lights. Inside, they were amazed to see curved mirror-like walls, translucent 
          tables, and a waiter and waitress only four feet tall and dressed in silver uniforms. 
          The high strangeness had just begun.</p>

          <p><b>A UFO DEPOSITS UNKNOWN MATERIAL</b>. On <b>May 10, 1957</b>, Michel Fekete rode 
          his bicycle on his way home in Beaucourt sur L’Ancre, France. A bright light on the 
          road ahead dazzled him and he saw 4 short menacing figures approach. He ran to the 
          neighbors, and they all watched for the next 20 minutes as the figures darted back 
          and forth. The object departed, but it left behind patches of a strange black, elastic 
          material.</p>

          <p><b>THE ALIEN ROBOTS</b>. On <b>Oct 23, 1965</b>, James Townsend was 4 miles from his 
          home in Long Prairie, MN when a rocket-shaped UFO landed on the road in front of him. 
          Several tiny tin-can-shaped robotic figures exited the craft and began to approach. 
          James had the feeling they were watching him. Little did he know, many people in the 
          area were also seeing UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>CHASED BY A UFO</b>. At <b>8:00 a.m., on April 8, 1966</b>, Gary Hunt and Mike 
          Dorsey (both age 12) were walking to school in Norwalk, CT when a UFO swooped over 
          their heads. It then made a U-turn in the sky and swooped down again, and then a third 
          time. The boys fled in panic. The UFO chased them into the woods, forcing them to hide 
          under a bridge. Other people in the area watched their ordeal. Later, the boys were 
          questioned by a secret govt agent.</p>

          <p><b>“I WAS SHOT BY AN ET RAY-GUN!”</b> On <b>Sep 3, 1976</b>, Joao Romeu Klein was 
          walking to his home in Santa Catarina, Brazil. A flying disc approached and hovered 
          ahead of him on the path. A red beam of light shone down and deposited 3 dwarf-like 
          figures who blocked his path. Then the UFO darted behind Joao, blocking his escape. 
          Joao threw his work-knife at the creatures. But they responded by aiming a ray-gun 
          at him, striking him with a beam of light.</p>

          <p><b>UFO PREDICTS FATAL BUS ACCIDENT</b>. On <b>Mar 18, 1988</b>, a bus carrying 22 
          members of a religious sect plummeted from a mountain highway, killing 4 passengers and 
          injuring 18 others. The driver (who had been drinking) was charged with murder. The head 
          of the sect, Peter Thomas, revealed that the group had seen a UFO, and that night, he had 
          dreamed about the UFO, which warned him that a tragic accident would occur.</p>

          <p><b>BURNED BY A UFO</b>. On <b>Mar 31, 1980</b>, two circus employees (Paride Orfei and 
          Phelipe Garcia) stood by the circus tent in Gioia del Colle, Italy when a bright light 
          zoomed down and hovered overhead. It stayed only briefly but caused the circus animals 
          to react strangely. Seconds later, it darted away. That’s when both men realized that 
          they had been burned by the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>THE UFO WITH TENTACLES</b>. On <b>Oct 27, 1981</b>, three young girls (Pia 
          Andersson, Carina Sjostrom and Anna-Karin Lindahl) rode their horses near their 
          homes in Kvilla, Sweden. The horses were acting up when a glowing disc dropped from 
          the sky and hovered overhead. It had weird tentacle-like appendages around the 
          perimeter. All the girls were paralyzed in fear. Finally, the object left, and the 
          girls galloped home.</p>

          <p><b>THEY LOOKED LIKE BAGS</b>. Late at <b>night on Nov 2, 1989</b>, two truck drivers, 
          Oleg Kirzhakov and Nikolai Baranchikov encountered a landed UFO on a remote highway near 
          Arkhangelsk, Russia. The truck engine died, so Oleg went to investigate the craft. At 
          first a weird forcefield prevented his progress. But then a door opened, and weird 
          bag-shaped figures emerged. The next thing Oleg knew, he was being taken onboard.</p>

          <p>These encounters all contain unique and bizarre elements of high strangeness and 
          show just how bizarre UFO contact can be. And yet, many also have physical evidence: 
          landing traces, medical affects, EM effects, animal reactions and more. These very 
          weird cases have something very important to teach us about UFOs and extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">One of the rarest kinds of UFO encounters is when a craft 
          lands on the ground. But the fact is, there are thousands of cases on record like this. 
          They reach back decades up to the present day. They come from all over the world. Many 
          have multiple witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence including animal reactions, 
          landing traces, EM disturbances, medical effects and more. These cases make it clear that 
          UFOs are technological advanced machines. Here are a dozen cases of this kind which show 
          just how strange and fascinating the UFO phenomenon can be.</p>

          <p><b>APR 7, 1950, AMARILLO, TX</b>: When David Lightfoot (age 12) and his cousin Charles 
          Lightfoot (age 9) went fishing by their home, they saw an odd object zoom overhead, circle 
          around, and then land next to them. It was only a few feet wide. David ran up to the craft 
          and touched it as it took off. Afterward, his arms and face were red and covered with welts.</p>

          <p><b>NOV 3, 1960, PRICE COUNTY, WI</b>: Two eight-year-old boys (Douglas Fox and Mr. 
          Gehring) decided to test their new bow and arrow out in the wilds near their home. Hearing 
          a weird noise and feeling a blast of heat, they looked up and saw a flying saucer land on 
          the hill next to them. They ran up to it, at which point it took off. The ground at the 
          site was still hot.</p>

          <p><b>JUL 19, 1965, VAUCLUSE BEACH, NSW, AUSTRALIA</b>: Denis Crowe was taking a walk along 
          the beach when he saw a glow ahead and heard barking dogs. As he approached, he saw that 
          the light was a silver saucer-shaped craft resting on short landing legs. He got to within 
          60 feet, at which point it shot upwards, leaving burned marks on the ground.</p>

          <p><b>MAR 1, 1966, CARSON CITY, MI</b>: Two seven-year-olds were walking in a field near 
          their home when they came upon a huge, silver, cigar-shaped craft. Heat waves were coming 
          off it. As they walked up to it, it took off in a weird zigzag maneuver. On the ground they 
          found crushed, burned grass and strange holes.</p>

          <p><b>MAR 29, 1966, HAMILTON, ONTARIO, CANADA</b>: Charles Cozens (age 13) watched in awe 
          as two strange craft landed directly behind the local police station. He approached one of 
          the craft and actually touched it. It felt smooth and metallic, but as he touched it, an 
          electric arc three feet long zapped him on the hand, causing a burn.</p>

          <p><b>MAR 29, 1966, ANCHORAGE, AK</b>: It was many years after the incident when a young 
          man remembered his childhood encounter with a UFO that landed on the street right in front 
          of his house. The craft was about 50 feet wide and had a little ladder leading down to the 
          ground. Unknown to the witness, his own brother watched from the house.</p>

          <p><b>AUG 26, 1968, GLEESON, AZ</b>: Pearl Christensen was driving home when she saw two 
          large craft landed on the peak of the nearby 7200-foot-high Brown’s Peak. She watched 
          them through binoculars for almost 4 hours. Another witness also saw them. Later, 
          researchers went to the landing spot and found landing marks and burned vegetation on 
          the site.</p>

          <p><b>MAR 13, 1975, MELLEN, WI</b>: The Baker family could hardly believe their eyes when 
          they saw a classic, silver flying saucer with colored lights and a dome on top landed on 
          the street right next to their home. They called the police, but the craft departed. But 
          the next few days, the craft returned and was seen by many people, including police officers.</p>

          <p><b>Nov 10, 1978, KUWAIT</b>: Seven oilfield workers got the shock of their life when a 
          UFO landed next to the Al Sabriyah oil pumping station, knocking it off-line. It was as 
          big as a jumbo jet and remained there for 7 minutes. An investigation revealed sightings 
          both before and after. One man even photographed the UFO. The case went to the highest 
          levels of govt.</p>

          <p><b>Nov 27, 1978, LEEDS, ENGLAND</b>: Lynsey Tebbs and Susan Pearson (both age 14) were 
          walking near their homes they saw a UFO hover overhead and then land right next to them. 
          They turned to run, but the craft took off. They stopped and watched it land again. 
          Researchers arrived and discovered strange landing traces. Then the govt showed up!</p>

          <p><b>MAR 30, 1995, TRANSVAAL, SOUTH AFRICA</b>: Jan Pienaar was driving along a country 
          road when he came upon a landed UFO right in the middle of the road. His truck engine 
          failed, and he became paralyzed. The craft, he saw, had a gaping hole in the side. 
          Shortly later, the craft took off, leaving behind scorched marks. Other people in the 
          area also saw UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>APR 10, 2002, CROSSVILLE, TN</b>: A teacher woke up early in the morning and saw 
          a 20-foot-wide metallic craft floating on the surface of the lake. She watched it for 
          one minute, then went to get her husband. When they returned, the craft was gone. Later 
          she saw an object exit the lake, and further events revealed that she was having direct 
          contact.</p>

          <p>These cases show that UFOs are physical machines utilizing an advanced technology far 
          beyond our own. These cases leave no doubt that we are being visited. They are only a 
          small sampling of the huge number of cases involving UFO landings.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This is a strange category, but there are many cases where 
          people encounter a craft that is so close, they can see the humanoids inside of it! It’s 
          a unique category that is more than just a UFO sighting, but not quite an onboard 
          experience. Yet, they are equally fascinating and often involve very high strangeness. 
          With multiple witnesses and lots of physical evidence, these cases represent an 
          important contribution to our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <p><b>1952, SEAT PLEASANT, MD</b>: It was a hot summer night, when Suzanne Knight heard 
          a strange buzzing noise. Looking outside, she saw a glowing object descend. She thought 
          it might be a crashing plane, but then the object stopped and through one of the 
          windows, she saw a strange figure.</p>

          <p><b>1954, RANTON, ENGLAND</b>: Hearing a strange sound, Jessie Roestenburg rushed 
          outside her home and saw her two children lying on the ground in shock. A large UFO 
          hovered overhead. And looking down at them through a large picture window were two 
          beautiful human-looking ETs.</p>

          <p><b>1957, OLD SAYBROOK, CT</b>: When a bright light flooded her room, Mary Starr 
          looked outside and saw a massive cigar-shaped craft hovering only a few feet above the 
          ground. It was lined with portholes, and inside the craft she saw three very strange 
          figures wearing weird uniforms and strange square helmets.</p>

          <p><b>1959, MARIANNELUND, SWEDEN</b>. Suffering a sudden power-failure, Gideon 
          Johansson exited his house only to watch a saucer-shaped craft descend into his yard 
          and almost land. Through the windows, she saw two strange bald figures with big 
          beautiful eyes filled with intelligence.</p>

          <p><b>1962, LAKE MOVIL, MN</b>: After the entire family had a UFO sighting, Mildred 
          Anderson and her daughter Marilyn notice an odd glowing red object outside their cabin. 
          Looking outside, they are amazed to see a large window on a craft, and inside are two 
          ETs staring right at them.</p>

          <p><b>1968, REUNION ISLAND, FRANCE</b>: Hiking in the forest to pick some grass for his 
          plants, Luce Fontaine comes upon a massive craft hovering about 15 feet above the ground. 
          Through a massive picture window, he saw two ETs wearing spacesuits that looked just like 
          the Michelin Man.</p>

          <p><b>1973, MANCHESTER, NH</b>: Driving home, Lyndia Morel was puzzled by a colorful 
          star-like object that blinked on and off and seemed to follow her car. Without warning, 
          the object appeared in front of her car, a massive craft. And looking down at her was a 
          gray-skinned alien with big dark eyes.</p>

          <p><b>1974, MEDELLIN, SPAIN</b>: Driving to his father’s farm, Santiago Pulido Romero 
          saw a UFO pacing his car. He blinked his headlights at the object, which reacted by 
          zooming towards him. As he arrived at the farm, the craft followed. And inside, through 
          the window of the craft, were weird-looking aliens.</p>

          <p><b>1975, SAN ANTONIO, TX</b>: He first thought it was a helicopter, but when it 
          hovered over his truck, Alois Olenick realized he was seeing a genuine UFO. It had a 
          huge window in front, through which Alois could see two strange-looking short figures 
          with bald heads, pointed ears, big noses and gray wrinkled skin.</p>

          <p><b>1977, TUCSON, AZ</b>: Running outside their home, Lois Stovall and her grandmother, 
          Alice were amazed to see a tiny capsule-shaped UFO with a child-sized figure standing up 
          inside it. It was so close, they could almost touch it. They watched it swoop up into 
          the sky while nearby helicopters searched for it.</p>

          <p><b>1977, DORSET, ENGLAND</b>: Ethel May Field went outside to take the laundry off 
          the clothesline when suddenly a large craft swooped down and tilted towards her. Inside, 
          through a large window, she saw two human-looking ETs. And one of them was looking down 
          and pointing right at her.</p>

          <p><b>1979, SAN FERNANDO, CA</b>: When an intense UFO wave strikes the area, dozens of 
          people report low-flying craft. Two witnesses have a craft approach so close to them 
          that they can clearly see two humanoid figures looking down at them through the window 
          of the craft.</p>

          <p><b>1983, MOBILE, AL</b>: Driving off Highway 90 to her home, Pat Norris sees a 
          strange light in the forest. Pulling over to get a better look, she sees a massive 
          craft hovering overhead. A long panel window lines the craft allowing her to see 
          dozens of white-suited figures walking gracefully around the craft.</p>

          <p><b>OCT 2003, WESTERVILLE, OH</b>: David Noll and his wife can hardly believe 
          their eyes. Hovering in the sky above their home is a large craft with a humanoid 
          figure inside. When it remains in place, they view the UFO through binoculars and 
          can see that the figure is wearing a light-colored one-piece suit.</p>

          <p>These 14 cases span six decades and come from across the planet. They provide 
          some profound insights into the UFO phenomenon. They show that it is global, 
          ongoing and incredibly varied with UFO shapes and humanoid types. Most important, 
          they show that UFOs are showing themselves intentionally in what appears to be a 
          publicity campaign announcing their presence. The question is, will we listen?</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Saved by aliens! Helped, healed, rescued, there are many 
          cases on record where ETs have intervened to help those in need. While a close encounter 
          can be scary, it can also be a Godsend to those who are in trouble. This video presents a 
          dozen cases in which UFOs and extraterrestrials showed up just in time. These include 
          sightings, face-to-face encounters, landings and onboard UFO experiences. The cases reach 
          back decades. They come from all over the world and have occurred to many all kinds of 
          people. With all the fear and confusion surrounding ET contact, these cases are profoundly 
          important and show that some ETs do have our best interests in mind.</p>

          <p><b>SEP 27, 1959: COOS BAY, OR</b>. Leo Bartsch had been suffering from an undiagnosed 
          problem with his arm, causing pain and numbness. Then, in the middle of the night, he 
          found himself floating above his bed, and sensed that a UFO was over his house. Moments 
          later, he was lowered to his bed, and realized to his delight, that his arm was healed!</p>

          <p><b>1960s: TN</b>. The head of Project Blue Book, Edward Ruppelt reveals that the Blue 
          Book office received a letter from a mountaineer in TN who says that a strange round 
          glowing object came into his living room and healed him of chronic arthritis.</p>

          <p><b>APR 1971: VA</b>. In a letter to NICAP, a prisoner in the Southern Correction 
          Facility in Lucasville, OH related an amazing story of how a UFO may have helped him. 
          The man was being chased by the police when a UFO dropped down from the sky and hovered 
          150 feet over his head. The prisoner felt a telepathic rapport with the UFO and had a 
          sense of being watched. Then the UFO began to follow him.</p>

          <p><b>SEP 22, 1972: DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</b>. While driving along a remote highway, Virgilio 
          Gomez was flagged down by a gentleman. Exiting his car, he was shocked to see two other 
          tall, strange-looking figures, and behind them along the road, a landed UFO. The man who 
          flagged Virgilio down said his name was Freddie Miller, and that he had been lost at sea 
          13 years earlier, but was rescued by the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>1979: SOUTH VIETNAM</b>. A soldier and his fellow soldiers had become separated 
          from their main unit and pinned down by a group of Vietcong soldiers. They had given up 
          any chance of getting back to their unit when, without warning, a massive blue saucer 
          hovered over the Vietcong soldiers, causing them to scatter.</p>

          <p><b>1980: THE CARIBBEAN</b>. French singer, Antoine, had moored his boat on a small 
          island. Waking up in the middle of the night, Antoine was horrified to find that his 
          anchor had broken loose, and he was now at the mercy of the waves. He was lost and 
          heading for a coral reef. That’s when a UFO appeared right over his boat, grabbed ahold 
          it with a strange force and pulled it to safety.</p>

          <p><b>APR 10, 1982: COOKE CITY, MT</b>. Snowmobiling in the mountains, Mr. H. was 
          overcome by a blizzard. Looking up, he saw a bright blue sphere overhead. Unable to 
          hear it over the storm, he thought it was a rescue helicopter, especially when it 
          began to lead him out of the wilderness. Instead, it led him to a group of snowmobilers 
          who were lost and needed help.</p>

          <p><b>APR 1983: ALICE SPRINGS, AUSTRALIA</b>. Maggie Hite (age 73) had suffered from 
          arthritis for years when a UFO landed in her backyard. Out stepped short humanoids who 
          escorted her onto their craft and healed her. Her physician was shocked to find her 
          totally healthy.</p>

          <p><b>AUG 1985, MILBANKE SOUND, BC, CANADA</b>. Randy Morrison and Leonard Egolf were 
          sailing in the ocean and got caught in a fierce storm which capsized their boat. They 
          clung to the hull until the waves threw them into the sea. Leonard was never seen again. 
          Randy was on the verge of giving up when a glowing object appeared overhead, giving him 
          encouragement to hang on a little longer.</p>

          <p><b>DEC 1988: WATSONVILLE, CA</b>. When Ann Desoto and her boyfriend encountered a 
          landed UFO, they didn’t realize that they had missing time until they returned home. 
          But Ann did notice a strange mark on her hip. And strangely, the arthritis in her hip 
          had disappeared. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled an onboard experience where she 
          was healed by the grays.</p>

          <p><b>OCT 1989: USA</b>. Retired military officer Dolores Galvin was shocked to see a 
          tall dark figure enter her bedroom and lean over her bed. In his hand he held a strange 
          silver pencil-shaped object, which he applied to her arthritic shoulder. Dolores felt a 
          floating sensation and then passed out. When she awoke, her arthritis was gone.</p>

          <p><b>SEP 27, 1993: CORDILLERA TAJSARA, BOLIVIA</b>. Lost in the mountainous wilderness, 
          hiker Robert Suarez Molina thought he was a goner. Little did he know, rescuers were 
          searching for him and kept seeing unexplained lights. Then Robert himself saw a UFO 
          land. A humanoid exited the craft and let him know he was about to be rescued.</p>

          <p>These cases reveal a friendly side to the ETs that is often overlooked and ignored. 
          But the cases speak for themselves. The proof is in the pudding. People do have 
          benevolent encounters.</p>

          <h5>Jun 23, 2023 (1:02:47)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, 
          landings, face-to-face encounters, and of course, onboard UFO encounters. Of the many 
          kinds of UFO encounters, cases of people going inside UFOs are among the most fascinating. 
          These accounts contain the most information and tell us the most about extraterrestrials 
          and their agenda on this planet.</p>

          <p>A wide variety of events occur inside UFOs. While there are patterns, each case seems 
          to contain new and unique details. There are many different types of extraterrestrials. 
          And there are thousands (or perhaps millions) of these cases occurring across the world. 
          Yet still there are more questions than answers.</p>

          <p>This video presents six fascinating true accounts of people who have been inside UFOs. 
          Each provides profound insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and ET contact, 
          and shows exactly what it’s like to experience the closest of all UFO encounters.</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE: “THE SCENE THAT I SAW WAS HORRIBLE.”</b> In <b>May of 1950</b>, Dr. 
          Enrique Caretuno Botta was driving through the desert in Bahia Blanca, Argentina when 
          he saw a landed silvery saucer by the dirt highway. Exiting his car, he walked up to 
          the craft and saw that a door was opened. Curious, he entered the craft and was horrified 
          to see three dead humanoids. He walked around and inspected the craft for about five 
          minutes, but was freaked out and left. Returning the next day with friends, the craft 
          was gone, leaving a pile of ash. But up above them hovered three UFOs. And Dr. Botta 
          had his camera ready.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: “INSPECTED BY MACHINE-LIKE ALIENS.”</b> Lee Parrish of Prospect, KY was 
          19-years old when he left his friend’s house at 1:00 a.m., on <b>Jan 27, 1977</b>. It 
          was a short 7-minute drive home. But his journey was interrupted by the arrival of a 
          UFO hovering over his car. He rushed home, only to find that he was missing 35 minutes 
          of time. His eyes were sore and painful, the cigarette he was smoking was missing, and 
          the electrical system of his car went haywire. Realizing his sighting was something more, 
          he went under hypnosis and recalled being lifted into the craft where he encountered 
          strange machine-like ETs who seemed very interested in him.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: “I CAN REMEMBER, BUT CAN’T SAY.”</b> On the evening of <b>Jun 20, 
          1977</b>, Rachel Jones of Coeur D’Alene, ID woke up and found herself unable to move 
          as a strange figure carried her out of her home. She blacked out and woke up with a bad 
          headache and a weird mark on her shoulder. A short time later, while flying on a jet, 
          she saw unexplained flashes of light and received a strange message of greeting. 
          Realizing that something very strange was happening, she sought out hypnosis. She 
          remembered being taken onboard a craft and undergoing a strange procedure, but she was 
          compelled not to talk about it. At least at first.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FOUR: “I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU.”</b> On <b>Sep 25, 1980</b>, Elias Seixas de 
          Mattos, his cousin Alberto Seixas, and their friend Guaraci Fernandes de Sousa took a 
          thousands-miles-long road trip from Belem to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While on the road, 
          Elias received a weird telepathic message. Stopping their vehicle, the three men 
          encountered a large glowing craft ahead of them on the highway. They then experienced 
          five hours of missing time. Later, under hypnosis, Elias recalled being pulled onboard 
          the craft where he met a seven-foot-tall ET.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FIVE: “SOME WILL BELIEVE YOU, OTHERS WILL NOT.”</b> On the evening of <b>Aug 
          7, 1983</b>, Julio Platner was opening the gate of a ranch in Winifreda, Argentina when 
          he was struck by a beam of light. The next thing he knew he was lying naked on a table 
          inside a small round room, surrounded by strange hairless humanoids with round bulging 
          eyes. The ETs told him to have no fear, that they had taken thousands of people beside 
          him and would cause no harm. Then began a very strange examination. After a short 
          conversation, Julio was returned, only to find that he was now 8 miles from where he 
          had been taken.</p>

          <p><b>CASE SIX: “WE ONLY WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.”</b> It was a warm evening in 
          <b>Jul 1988</b> when Carlos Manuel Mercado was woken up by a brilliant light shining 
          into his home in Betances, Puerto Rico. Opening his window, he was shocked to see three 
          hairless humanoids with huge dark eyes standing outside his home. Initially frightened, 
          Carlos was reassured by the figures, who led him outside to a landed craft. The UFO took 
          off towards and nearby mountain range and then traveled underneath it to an apparently 
          underground base. During this time, Carlos met with a tall humanoid who had a special 
          message for him, and a request.</p>

          <p>Practically everything we know about UFOs and extraterrestrials comes from the 
          firsthand cases of UFO contactees. And there are now enough cases on record, with all 
          types of physical evidence to prove the reality of UFO contact. These cases leave little 
          doubt that we are being visited and that the Universe is filled with life of all kinds.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are known for sending brilliant beams of light onto 
          the ground, onto vehicles, and especially onto people. These beams come in many 
          different colors. They can be wide or narrow. And they exhibit many properties that 
          far exceed the capabilities of normal light beams. They heal wounds, cause burns, 
          levitate, paralyze, pull people through solid objects, and much more. They make it 
          very clear that our own understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum remains woefully 
          incomplete.</p>

          <p>Why are UFOs sending down these beams of light? How do they produce these amazing 
          effects? What is it like to be “beamed by a UFO?” This video presents ten firsthand 
          accounts, spanning decades and coming from across the planet. They vividly recount 
          people’s experiences of being struck by a UFO beam of light and answer many of the 
          questions surrounding this unique aspect of UFO behavior.</p>

          <p><b>AUG 25, 1972: TITUSVILLE, PA</b>. Driving along Route 408 in Rockdale township, 
          newspaper editor Frank Holowach is puzzled to see a strange twinkling light in the night 
          sky. Frank realizes he is seeing an actual UFO. At first he's excited. But then it moves 
          closer, shines a light on him, and his car begins to vibrate. Then he feels himself 
          vibrating. And when he feels an odd magnetic force pulling on him, he is filled with 
          fear.</p>

          <p><b>FEB 1956: CHOISY-LE-ROI, FRANCE</b>. Mademoiselle Roi is driving along Road 186 
          when she hears a hissing noise and sees a bright object. She pulls over and sees a 
          landed UFO and short humanoids beneath. She jumps from her car and runs to the ETs, 
          trying to grab one of them. Then a beam comes from the craft and strikes her, paralyzing 
          her.</p>

          <p><b>APR 1960: PUY-DE-DOME, FRANCE</b>. Baker and former Air Force officer Germain 
          Tichit is drawn outside by colored lights and a loud noise. Going to investigate, he 
          sees a landed UFO. A small figure emerges. Realizing that it's an ET, he lunges forward 
          to capture it. The ET whips out a tubular device and points it at Germain, striking him 
          with a laser-like beam of light.</p>

          <p><b>OCT 30, 1967: BOYUP BROOK, AUSTRALIA</b>. It was 9:20 p.m., as Alexander Spargo 
          drives at 65 mph along the Kojonup-Mayanup Road. Without warning his motor stops, his 
          headlights go out and a brilliant tube of light focuses on him from above. Looking up 
          he sees a huge saucer. To his shock, his car has come to a complete stop. And when the 
          beam retracts, he is shocked to see that his car is racing along the road.</p>

          <p><b>APR 5, 1974: MOUNT OLIVE, NC</b>. Newspaper reporter Nelson Bland had heard about 
          recent sightings in the area, but driving along Hwy 117, he is shocked to see a strange 
          pulsating light in the sky. As it zooms closer, he sees a classic flying saucer. He 
          grabs his camera and is about to take a photo when he is engulfed by a brilliant beam 
          of light. “I almost fainted,” he said.</p>

          <p><b>May 26, 1977: SALISBURY NORTH, AUSTRALIA</b>. When three teenagers go biking in the 
          fields behind their homes, they have no idea that they are about to have an unforgettable 
          encounter with a UFO. After setting down their bikes in a creek-bed, a beam of light 
          shines down on their bikes, causing them to glow. One boy jumps forward and touches the 
          beam. He is thrown to the ground by the beam. The other two boys dive for cover.</p>

          <p><b>SEP 1978: DILHORNE, ENGLAND</b>. It was 1:30 a.m., and Stephen Colclough and his 
          girlfriend are driving along a country road and see a strange red and white lights in 
          the sky. Without warning, a huge black object looms in front of them and strikes them 
          with a powerful searchlight. Says Stephen, “It was absolutely terrifying.”</p>

          <p><b>SEP 10, 1981: PLYMOUTH ENGLAND</b>. As Denise Bishop steps into her apartment, 
          she looks up and ses a massive UFO shining down colorful beams of light. She is 
          entranced by its beauty, but realizing it's a UFO, she turns to rush inside. The UFO 
          sends down a pencil-thin green beam of light, striking her hand, stopping her in her 
          tracks. As it retracts, she runs inside. Then she sees the burn-mark on her hand.</p>

          <p><b>NOV 28, 1981: STARKS, ME</b>. Kenos Henry drives to his home when he saw a UFO. 
          It sends down a thin beam of red light into his eyes. As he rushes away, the craft 
          follows. Later that night, Harold Hendsbee and his wife are confronted by a UFO which 
          blocks the road and strikes them with a brilliant light. The UFO wave in Starks, Maine 
          has just begun.</p>

          <p><b>JAN 8, 1984: FRAMINGHAM, MA</b>. An anonymous witness wakes up in bed to a 
          startling sight. A mysterious green shaft of light is shining in his window, aimed 
          directly into his right eye, causing heat and pain. He hears a strange whirring sound 
          and sees the faint outline of a being.</p>

          <p>These cases show how powerful these beams of light can be. They show that the ETs 
          have a profound understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum, and they know how to 
          use it to do things that border on the miraculous. Cases like these have much to 
          teach us about light, and about how ETs behave, and their agenda on our planet.</p>

          <h5>Jun 9, 2023 (0:51:42)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs can have many weird effects. They provoke strange 
          alterations in plants. They cause bizarre electromagnetic disturbances in machines. 
          They create a wide variety of landing traces. They make animals behave in weird and 
          unusual ways. They affect people physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. 
          When UFOs show up, almost anything can happen. This video presents a dozen cases 
          spanning four decades and occurring to all kinds of people from all over the world.</p>

          <p><b>Apr 24, 1954: Buyere, France</b>. Two lumberjacks, Roger Mougeolle and Gilbert 
          Doridant see three huge metallic UFOs. One of them lands in a field. Gilbert runs 
          away in fear, but Roger walks up and taps it with his axe. He then raises his axe 
          and strikes it. He is promptly thrown to the ground and temporarily paralyzed.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 16, 1965: Montes Claros, Brazil</b>. When 32-year-old banker, Filomeno Bido 
          de Oliveira goes fishing one evening, a UFO drops down and hovers 150 feet overhead. 
          After it leaves, Filomeno body reacts strangely. Although he felt no fear during the 
          encounter, his heart is racing, and he urinated in his pants. The next day, his entire 
          body is weirdly numb.</p>

          <p><b>Feb 14, 1967: Miller County, MO</b>. Early in the morning, a farmer sees a domed-
          shaped object with colored lights in his field. Strange-looking figures stand beneath 
          it. He picks up two rocks and tosses them at the craft. Inexplicably, the rocks hit an 
          invisible barrier and fall to the ground. As the witness approaches closer, he hits the 
          invisible barrier himself.</p>

          <p><b>Nov 25, 1968: Necochea, Argentina</b>. Local farmers are concerned when they see 
          UFOs and then find burned circles in their fields. Even stranger is the appearance of 
          many giant-sized mushrooms outside the circles. They grow so quickly that some soon 
          reach the size of footballs, two feet across and one foot high.</p>

          <p><b>Jan 29, 1969: Matadepera, Spain</b>. An 80-year-old woman is picking wild herbs 
          when a weird metallic craft emerges from the trees, swoops below the powerlines and 
          zooms off. Returning to the site with investigators, they discover four tunnels dug 
          horizontally into the ground in a weird pattern, and in a way no animal or known machine 
          could do.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 20, 1971: Vitry-en-Artois, France</b>. Monsieur F. Laisne was outside his home 
          and sees a large spherical object move over his own house to a tall poplar tree. The 
          object emits brilliant lights, snapping off a branch from the tree. As it moves away, 
          his dog barks, his cows scatter, a railway near his home sparks, and his alarm clocks 
          in the house all stop.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1971: Sarcee, Canada</b>. An doctor is horseback riding when his horse 
          becomes agitated. A saucer-shaped object swoops down, causing the horse to panic. 
          After the object leaves, the horse remains shy and nervous. In the days that follow, 
          his own horse develops a strange illness.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 31, 1975: Loxton, South Africa</b>. Danie Van Graan is checking on his sheep 
          and sees a landed UFO and occupants. Getting closer, he is struck by a beam of light, 
          causing a choking sensation, a nosebleed and vomiting. Van Graan then realizes his 
          eyesight has also been affected. At the landing cite are weird landing impressions 
          and a strange green substance.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 5, 1978: Wellingborough, England</b>. When many witnesses across town report 
          a low-flying craft, it’s clear that something strange is going on. Then15-year-old 
          Caroline Muncey and her friend Mandy are walking home, the UFO swoops down and chases 
          them down the street. Afterwards, Caroline finds a strange rash on her hands and arms.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1979: Oktyabrskiy, Russia</b>. A team of eight oil-field workers are terrified 
          when a UFO lands on their worksite. Going to investigate the next morning, they find 
          three deep marks in a triangular formation on the ground. In the center is a hole 
          reaching 100 feet in depth.</p>

          <p><b>Late 1980: Frankfurt, Germany</b>. When a crew of a 707 jet leaves New York 
          for Frankfurt, they are tailed by a saucer which illuminates the interior of their 
          cockpit. It’s caught on radar and viewed from the ground. Afterward, the captain 
          begins having nightmares of weird alien creatures.</p>

          <p><b>Feb 1981: Mojave Desert, CA</b>. A prospector returns from a trip into the desert 
          with an incredible story of a UFO landing. After it takes off, he notices weird silvery 
          spheres which glowed for two days afterwards. He picks up one of the stones, which shows 
          many unusual properties. When it’s analyzed by scientists, it defies identification. 
          Only later do they discover its strange composition.</p>

          <p>These cases reveal some important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. 
          They show that UFOs are visiting many locations on our planet for a long period of 
          time. They show that UFOs can affect the soil, the vegetation, animal life, machines 
          and most importantly, humans…all in a wide variety of unexpected ways. They show that 
          the ETs display an interest in all things Earth and all things human. And they also 
          provide compelling evidence for the reality of UFOs.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">All types of UFO encounters are important and add to our 
          knowledge of this very complex subject. Among the most extraordinary are cases of UFO 
          landings and face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials. Sightings don’t contain very 
          much data, and the onboard UFO experience often has the issues of missing time, 
          hypnotically-recalled memories, not to mention the fear and trauma that often comes 
          with it. Cases involving landings and humanoids, however, belong to a unique category 
          of encounters that allows witnesses to experience the phenomenon directly and without 
          the issues of missing time.</p>

          <p>Here are ten extraordinary cases of alien meetings from across the planet. They 
          reach back into the <b>1950s</b> and continue up to the <b>1980s</b>. Most involve 
          multiple witnesses. Many involve compelling physical evidence such as animal reactions, 
          medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and even landing traces. Most remarkable 
          is the huge variety of humanoids seen, short and tall, skinny and wide, with variations 
          in appearance, clothing and the craft they fly. Each case also contains unique elements 
          in the way the ETs behave. Together they have much to tell us about the nature and 
          origin of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial agenda on our planet.</p>

          <p><b>MICHELIN MAN ETS</b>. <b>May 14, 1955</b>, Monsieur Droguet, a professor at the 
          College for Girls in Dinan, France was entering his home when he was struck by a beam 
          of light. Looking up, he saw a saucer-shaped object and right below it, two strange 
          humanoids, both dressed in uniforms like the Michelin Man seen on TV. One walked up to 
          the college and peered in one of the windows.</p>

          <p><b>SWIMMING ETS</b>. <b>Aug 1, 1962</b>, three sailors in two boats were in the 
          Mediterranean Sea and saw what they thought was a foreign submarine. Then, nearly a 
          dozen figures in weird wetsuits emerged and climbed onto the “sub.” Moments later it 
          rose from the sea to reveal itself to be a flying saucer.</p>

          <p><b>CAR-JACKING EXTRATERRESTRIAL</b>. <b>Nov 2, 1967</b>, Guy Tossie and Will 
          Begay drove on Highway 26 at Ririe, ID when a saucer dropped down in front of them 
          blocking their way. Inside they saw two strange humanoids. One floated to the car, 
          opened the door and got in the driver’s seat, steering the car into a field. One of 
          the men ran away in fear while the other stayed in the car with the ET.</p>

          <p><b>THEY LOOKED LIKE SAINTS</b>. <b>Jan 1968</b>, a family in Lagoa Negra, Brazil was 
          confronted by a landed saucer on their property. Two tall human-looking figures exited 
          the craft, followed by shorter figures. The short ETs stayed by the craft while the 
          tall ones approached the household, close enough for the witnesses to see them clearly. 
          To their shock, the ETs looked like saints.</p>

          <p><b>THE MILAKOVIC FAMILY ENCOUNTER</b>. <b>Nov 20, 1968</b>, Milin Milokovac, his wife 
          Doris, and their young son went house-hunting in Hanbury, England. Instead, they were 
          amazed to see a huge craft rise up from a field and move over their car. Even more 
          extraordinary, looking through the transparent canopy of the craft, they saw several 
          human-looking figures.</p>

          <p><b>TEN-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS</b>. On <b>Apr 14, 1971</b>, Dennis Donaldson and Marion 
          Lang were driving through Callery, PA and saw a bright light pacing their car. As it 
          darted around, it came very low and close, revealing itself to be a metallic craft. 
          The couple pulled over to get a closer-look and were awed to see windows in the craft 
          and two 10-foot-tall humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>ETS IN THE FRONT YARD</b>. <b>Jun 9, 1971</b>, Esther Clappison stepped out of 
          her home in Rosedale, Alberta, Canada and saw a weird craft landed only 200 from her 
          home. It had a huge picture window through which she could see two strangely dressed 
          figures. Outside the craft, another figure was picked up stones.</p>

          <p><b>MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOIDS</b>. <b>Jun 19, 1979</b>, Allan and Maila of Rauma, 
          Finland saw a tiny saucer-shaped object landed next to their home. Maila went outside 
          and walked up to the craft. Inside, she saw two tiny humanoids busy with a control 
          console. As she reached out to tap on the craft, the humanoids both turned to look 
          at her.</p>

          <p><b>THE RUNNING ALIENS</b>. <b>Jul 25, 1979</b>, Federico Ibanez went to pick 
          grapes from his vineyard in Turis, Spain and drove up to a landed UFO. Staring in 
          shock, he saw two oddly-dressed humanoids running at high speed from behind a tree 
          and into the craft.</p>

          <p><b>IT FOLLOWED US HOME</b>. <b>Dec 29, 1981</b>, two boys from Onsted, MI were 
          playing in their backyard when a UFO hovered overhead. Then a humanoid came floating 
          toward them. They ran away in fear, only to find that the humanoid followed them. It 
          was to be an encounter that would affect them profoundly for a long time afterwards.</p>

          <p>As extraordinary and bizarre as these cases may appear, they are all true, fully 
          investigated and often supported by multiple witnesses and physical evidence. 
          Although each case is different, they also share remarkable commonalities which 
          lend an additional level of corroboration. Mostly they show how truly extraordinary 
          the UFO phenomenon is.</p>

          <h5>May 26, 2023 (0:48:32)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many strange patterns to UFO activity, and one of 
          them appears to be a connection to the food crop, alfalfa. There are dozens of cases in 
          which UFOs are seen over alfalfa fields. These are not only low-level sightings, but 
          landings and humanoid encounters. They have been occurring since the modern age of UFOs 
          and continue today.</p>

          <p>The question is why? What is it about alfalfa that is attracting so many UFOs? This 
          video presents a chronology of cases from all over the world. Most of these cases involve 
          physical evidence such as animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic 
          disturbances, and most often: landing traces. These cases not only provide outstanding 
          evidence of UFO reality, they provide some startling insights into ET behavior.</p>

          <p><b>Sep 1974: Sioux City, IA</b>. George Hoffman steps outside his farmhouse and 
          sees a glowing object darting low over his alfalfa fields. Inspecting the area, he 
          finds a semi-circle of burned vegetation.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1975: Rochester, MN</b>. When numerous residents see a UFO land at a local 
          alfalfa farm, an inspection of the area reveals a strange landing trace shows exposure 
          to a very high heat source.</p>

          <p><b>Sep 1975: Starbuck, MN</b>. Farmer Gordon Hovendick usually grew corn, but this 
          year decided to grow alfalfa. When harvesting his crop, he discovers numerous strange 
          rings of burned vegetation in his fields.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1977: Arthur, NB</b>. When Janet Magnuson and her cousin have a close-up 
          encounter with a UFO, an investigation reveals a burned circle in a nearby alfalfa 
          field.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 1980: Orbisonia, PA</b>. An anonymous witness is picking alfalfa for her 
          rabbits when a UFO hovers low overhead. She brings the alfalfa home, but her rabbits 
          refuse to eat it.</p>

          <p><b>Jan 1981: Trans-en-Provence, France</b>. Retired stonemason Renato Nicolai 
          encounters a landed UFO in the wild alfalfa next to his house, leading to one of the 
          most well-verified UFO landing trace cases on record.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 1984: Prato di Principato, Italy</b>. Alfalfa farmer Giuseppe Cocozza is 
          checking his fields when he comes upon a 3-foot-tall humanoid holding a strange 
          instrument and poking it into the ground. When the figure notices Giuseppe, it 
          flees towards an oddly-shaped craft landed nearby.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1988: Elmwood, WI</b>. Farmers Charles and Evelyn Hutchins are shocked to find 
          strange circular rings in their alfalfa fields, only to learn that their neighbor had 
          seen UFOs in the area.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 1990: Barada, NB</b>. Charlie Kirkendall is cutting his alfalfa fields and 
          discovers two mysterious circles burned into his field. Neighbors flock to his field to 
          see, when word spreads that some of the neighbors in the area have been seeing strange 
          lights at night.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1992: Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada</b>. Phyllis Collins finds a nine-foot-
          diameter circle of flattened alfalfa in her fields and calls in an agricultural scientist 
          to investigate, who informs her that he has been studying numerous similar circles made 
          recently in the surrounding areas.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 2000: Kondoros, Hungary</b>. An anonymous farmer is driving his tractor through 
          his alfalfa fields when he is confronted by a short humanoid figure less than feet tall 
          who fearlessly approaches him.</p>

          <p>As these cases (and many others) show, ETs are attracted to alfalfa. Could it be that 
          they recognize its value as a food source, rich in vitamins and useful for its many 
          medicinal properties? It certainly looks that way! Whatever the reason, the connection 
          between UFOs and alfalfa is undeniable. There are too many cases to ignore. ETs love 
          alfalfa!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">People from all levels of society encounter UFOs, and that 
          includes the rich and famous. In fact, there is a very long list of celebrities who 
          have come forward revealing their own dramatic UFO encounters. Actors, musicians, 
          sports stars -- there are now about 100 cases of celebrity UFO encounters, and the 
          list is growing fast. Here are some new ones that you may not have heard of.</p>

          <p><b>JOHNNY CASH</b>: In <b>Feb 1981</b>, world-famous musician Johnny Cash was in 
          Jamaica when he had a dramatic UFO encounter. It was a clear night, and he was outside 
          with a group of people. Suddenly a bright streaking light caught his eye. He first 
          thought it was a shooting star. But then he saw it was oval in shape, purple in color, 
          and was making a strange noise. As Johnny says, “It was unearthly.”</p>

          <p><b>RONNIE JAMES DIO</b>: One of the most influential heavy metal vocalists of all 
          times, (heading such bands as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple) Ronnie is also a UFO 
          witness. In <b>1978</b>, Ronnie and his wife Donna were in their home in New Canaan, 
          CT when they saw an enormous globe of white light. They first thought it was the moon, 
          but then it started to move closer. “That was the presence of a UFO,” Dio says, “and we 
          were blown away.”</p>

          <p><b>ROMA DOWNEY</b>: Best known for her starring role in “Touched by an Angel,” Roma 
          Downey has also been touched by an alien. While in Joshua Tree, CA on <b>Oct 21, 2020</b>, 
          Roma and others saw several glowing objects. When they stayed in the sky, they actually 
          filmed one of the objects. “Something has appeared in the skies over Joshua Tree,” Roma 
          writes, “but what is it?”</p>

          <p><b>DARRELL EVANS</b>: Baseball superstar Darrell Evans was playing for the Detroit 
          Tigers when, in <b>June of 1982</b>, he and his wife LaDonna viewed a close-up UFO hover 
          by their home in Pleasanton, CA. The object was silent, metallic, glowing and less than 
          200 feet away. “It was as if they wanted us to see them,” Darrell says, “as if they had 
          singled us out.”</p>

          <p><b>GIGI HADID</b>: Super-model Gigi Hadid stunned the world when, in <b>2017</b>, she 
          described her sighting of a UFO while driving through the deserts of California. She 
          (and others) saw a strange “bright light" in the sky. She called the experience “crazy” 
          and “life-changing,” and now has a strong interest in the subject of UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>REINHOLD MESSNER</b>: The most famous mountain climber in the world, it should come 
          as no surprise that Reinhold has joined the ranks of celebrity UFO witnesses. While 
          climbing Mount Chamblang in the Himalayas, he and climbing partner Doug Scott saw a 
          glowing UFO for a period of three hours! Reinhold says that the object was “the size 
          of a full moon.” Doug says “The movements of this object were irregular.”</p>

          <p><b>DOUG PINNICK</b>: Lead singer for the heavy metal band, Kings X, Doug Pinnick 
          shocked the world when he said, “I was abducted by an alien.” One night, at age three, 
          a beautiful man “like Jesus” appeared in the bedroom of his home in Braidwood, IL. He 
          was led outside where he saw other similar figures. A bright light shone down and 
          lifted him up into the sky. Years later, watching Ancient Aliens, he saw drawings of 
          the same exact beings.</p>

          <p><b>WILL SMITH</b>: One of the most successful actors of modern times, Oscar-winner 
          Will Smith has starred in a long list of blockbuster movies such as Independence Day, 
          Men in Black and others. One night while driving with a friend through the Nevada 
          desert, he saw a hovering white light, which swooped down in front of his vehicle 
          and disappeared. “I was scared,” Will admitted. “I think there has to be something 
          out there.”</p>

          <p><b>DENNIS WEAVER</b>: Award-winning actor Dennis Weaver is best known for his role 
          in the TV series, McCloud. In <b>March 1986</b>, he and his wife Gerry had a close-up 
          sighting of a metallic cigar-shaped object over their home in Ridgway, CO. “We just 
          stood there and stared at it,” said Dennis. “It was certainly something that was 
          totally unidentified, something I’d never seen before.”</p>

          <p><b>KIM WILDE</b>: Creator of the mega-hit, “We’re the Kids in America,” UK-popstar 
          Kim Wilde saw a bright darting light over her home. “It was a UFO,” she says. “I can’t 
          believe it.” She was so impressed, she titled her new album, “Here Come the Aliens.”</p>

          <p><b>CINDY WILLIAMS</b>: Comedic actress Cindy Williams was the co-star of the sit-com, 
          Laverne & Shirley, which was at one point, the single most popular show on television. 
          While in San Bernardino, CA, Cindy and others saw a fleet of orange and purple discs 
          zooming across the sky. Says Cindy, “It was like they were trying to announce their 
          presence to us.”</p>

          <p>As can be seen, the UFO occupants visit all kinds of people on our planet, regardless 
          of age, ancestry, religion, sex, occupation, location, education…etc. Or could it be 
          that they are visiting famous people intentionally, putting on a display in the hopes 
          that celebrities will come forward and use their platform to tell the world that UFOs 
          are real?</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">If there is one word that sums up the UFO experience, 
          it’s “phantasmagorical.” Whether a sighting, a landing, a face-to-face encounter, an 
          onboard experience, or even a UFO crash/retrieval -- all of them contain levels of 
          weirdness and high strangeness that are a consistent feature of UFO cases. The variety 
          of UFO experiences are truly astonishing. They can be funny, bizarre, scary, 
          traumatizing, enlightening, healing and more.</p>

          <p>This video presents twelve cases which show just how truly weird and freaky the UFO 
          experience can be. These cases come from across the United States and the world. Most 
          involve multiple witnesses and varying kinds of physical evidence such as landing 
          traces, animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. 
          Each provides another piece of the puzzle towards solving the UFO mystery.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 1: ET LEADS MAN TO WATER</b>. In <b>1970</b>, Wyoming rancher Pat McGuire 
          became the laughing-stock of his community when he purchased a 6500-acre ranch in arid 
          desert land and said he was going to grow crops there, something nobody else had done. 
          But Pat had a secret, he was in contact with ETs, and they told him exactly where to 
          dig his well.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 2: ALIEN FISHERMEN</b>. On <b>Nov 2, 1972</b>, Monsieur Vuillien of Doucier, 
          France was shocked when a UFO drops down and hovers a mere 20 feet over his fish ponds 
          where he’s raising 50,000 trout. Then the object begins to move closer, so he retrieves 
          his gun and gets ready for a confrontation.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 3: THE UFO & THE WASHING-MACHINE</b>. The year of <b>1978</b> was a busy one 
          for Evelyn Whiteway of Parson Cross, England. After two sightings earlier in the year, 
          Evelyn had a third one. But this time it hovers over her house and causes a bizarre 
          effect on her washing machine. And after that, the UFOs return!</p>

          <p><b>CASE 4: THE ALIEN CHOCOLATE BAR</b>. On the morning of <b>Feb 28, 1974</b>, a 
          factory worker from Origney-En-Thierache, France is driving his moped to work when a 
          UFO lands next to him, and out step two figures dressed in spacesuits. They stop his 
          moped and hand him what looks like a chocolate bar, motioning for him to eat it. He 
          is unable to resist and puts it in his mouth.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 5: PAPERBOY SEES A UFO CRASH</b>. On <b>Feb 17, 1979</b>, while delivering 
          papers near his home in Tucson, AZ, 10-year-old Warren Weisman sees a small glowing 
          object crash to the ground in front of him, damaging a car and mailbox. As he’s 
          inspecting the weird metallic-looking object, a man-in-black shows up and suggests 
          that he leave the area.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 6: A UFO MAKES A FAMILY DIZZY</b>. On <b>Mar 11, 1979</b>, while driving 
          along Ware Road in Hertford, England, Alice Ball and her family stop the car to observe 
          a glowing UFO. As it moves over the car, they experience several very strange physical 
          effects.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 7: THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FROM A UFO</b>. While walking his dog on the evening 
          of <b>Nov 21, 1980</b>, near his home in Burneside, England, Mario Luisi comes upon a 
          landed UFO. Out step two of the most beautiful people he has ever seen. And they want 
          to talk to him.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 8: A BOY SHOOTS AN ALIEN</b>. On <b>Mar 11, 1981</b>, Cathy Gilpin and her 
          19-year-old son Arlin of Casey County, KY are drawn outside by a strange noise. Seeing 
          a glowing object, they go to investigate. Cathy drives towards it, and feels a strange 
          force pulling her to the object. She flees the scene, but Arlin goes outside with a 
          gun and comes face-to-face with a 7-foot creature.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 9: A UFO ROADBLOCK</b>. Late at night in <b>Feb 1983</b>, Ante Jonsson was 
          returning to his home in Tyngsrud, Sweden and saw what looked like a child on the road. 
          Looking up, he saw a huge UFO. It darted away. Ante went home to get his camera and 
          returned to the scene. The UFO was gone, but then it landed in the road. ETs came out 
          and surrounded his car.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 10: UFOS SUCK WATER FROM POOLS</b>. In <b>Jan 1984</b>, many residents of 
          Olavarria, Argentina observe a UFO hover over their swimming pools and suck the water 
          right out of them. And this isn’t the first time this has happened.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 11: A UFO MADE HIM PSYCHIC</b>. In <b>1988</b>, Stuart (a teacher in Mutare, 
          Africa) was walking through a field when a UFO hovered low overhead. Time seemed to move 
          in slow-motion as he fled the scene. After the sighting: he started predicting the 
          future.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 12: PINEAPPLE PINCHING ALIENS</b>. In the <b>late 1980s</b>, pineapple farmer 
          Harry Roy heard a loud thumping noise coming from his pineapple fields in Caloundra, 
          Australia. Going to investigate, he saw something that they couldn’t believe or 
          understand. They had just planted 15,000 pineapple plants. Every single one of them 
          were gone. </p>

          <p>As these cases show, just when you think you’ve heard everything about UFOs, another 
          case comes along and makes you realize that we still have much to learn about UFOs and 
          the ETs visiting our planet. They show that not only are we NOT alone in this universe, 
          but that extraterrestrials are intervening on many levels. There are too many cases to 
          ignore. The truth is coming out!</p>

          <h5>May 5, 2023 (1:09:40)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There is no experience quite like an onboard UFO encounter. 
          A simple sighting is undeniably interesting, but often they can be misperceived and 
          misinterpreted. Even UFO landings and face-to-face encounters tell us nothing about 
          what it’s like inside a craft. Onboard UFO encounters are so close-up that it’s 
          virtually impossible to misperceive the experience. Witnesses are not only touching 
          the UFO, they are breathing the air inside it, smelling the odors, hearing the sounds, 
          and communicating directly with the extraterrestrials. It is cases like these where we 
          learn the most about ETs, who they are, where they come from, why they are here and 
          their agenda on our planet.</p>

          <p>Cases of people being taken onboard are far more numerous than most people realize. 
          In fact, many researchers believe that millions of people are having these experiences. 
          They’ve been taking place for many years and occur all over the world.</p>

          <p>This video (and article) present ten cases of people who have had this astonishing 
          type of encounter. Many of these are multiple witness cases involving physical evidence 
          such as landing traces, EM disturbances and medical effects, both injuries and healings. 
          They show remarkable commonalities, and also unique features. In some of the cases, the 
          witnesses were able to hold long interactive conversations with the ETs and learned a 
          great deal of information.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 1: BARBARA SCHUTTE</b>. After attending a UFO convention in <b>1981</b>, 
          Barbara Schutte of Wever, Iowa learned that she herself was having UFO experiences. 
          After undergoing hypnosis, she learned she was a lifelong abductee and was given an 
          important life mission by the ETs to help educate the world about UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 2: CYNTHIA VODOVOZ</b>. In <b>Oct 1973</b>, Cynthia Vodovoz (age 12) was 
          driving with her mother to ballet class in Birmingham, AL when they had a missing 
          time UFO encounter. Later, under hypnosis, Cynthia recalled being pulled onboard and 
          examined. It was to be the first of many other encounters.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 3: MARTHA THRONE</b>. While driving with her husband, Ernest in Sonora, CA, 
          on <b>Oct 30, 1977</b>, Martha Throne was floated out of her car and into a UFO. She 
          was physically examined by human-looking ETs, and was amazed to see hundreds of ETs 
          onboard. The experience was profoundly benevolent and was spiritually transforming.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 4: PATRICK EUDY</b>. It was <b>Mar 9, 1979</b>. Driving near his home in 
          Monroe, NC, Patrick Eudy found himself and his car being sucked up into a craft. Inside, 
          he was examined by ETs, and was later taken to the control room. Looking out a window, 
          he saw the Earth far below him. He was returned to a location many miles away with 
          almost no memory of the event. It wasn’t until 2 years later that he went under 
          hypnosis and learned what had happened to him.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 5: LULI OSWALD & FAUZE MEHLEN</b>. On <b>Oct 15, 1979</b>, Luli Oswald and 
          her student Fauze Mehlen were pulled onboard a craft and examined by short beings with 
          a “rat-like” appearance. They told Luli they had contacted her because of her abilities 
          with ESP. The ETs seemed most interested in Fauze and told Luli that she was of no use 
          to them.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 6: MEGAN & RENEE ELLIOTT</b>. On <b>Aug 21, 1980</b>, Megan Elliott and her 
          daughter (age 1 ½) were driving near Lake Fork Creek in TX, when they were pulled with 
          their car into a craft. Megan was examined and her daughter was healed of two illnesses. 
          The ETs brought them to another room and gave them strange pellets of food. They then 
          answered many of Megan’s questions about who the ETs are and why they had taken her.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 7: RUBEN MENESES</b>. It was <b>Oct 15, 1981</b> when truckdriver Ruben 
          Meneses was pulled with his truck into a craft. Ruben was badly traumatized and after 
          being released from the craft many miles away, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Since 
          the encounter, he suffers from light sensitivity.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 8: VIV HAYWARD, ROSEMARY HAWKINS & VALERIE WALTERS</b>. After a night at 
          the disco, three friends, Viv Hayward, Rosemary Hawkins and Valerie Watkins drove home 
          and experienced 20 minutes of missing time. Under hypnosis, they recalled that they 
          were taken together onboard a craft.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 9: INDU SHAH</b>. In <b>1985</b>, while hiking near the Ganges River in Bihar, 
          India, 17-year-old Indu Shah was missing for 3 days. She was found wandering dazed and 
          disoriented with burns on her skin. Under hypnosis, she recalled a harrowing onboard 
          experience with strange ETs.</p>

          <p><b>CASE 10: ANGELO & GRACIA RICCI</b>. While picnicking near Cadore in the Italian 
          Alps on <b>Aug 15, 1986</b>, Angelo and Gracia Ricci watched a UFO land next to them. 
          7-foot-tall ETs came out and carried them onboard and gave them a strange exam.</p>

          <p>Ten cases, from all across the planet, each providing profound insights into the 
          nature of the UFO phenomenon, and each adding another piece of the puzzle to solving 
          the UFO mystery. Cases like these are impossible to deny. They leave no doubt that we 
          are being visited, that we are not alone in this amazing infinite universe.</p>

          UFO LANDINGS &<br>
          HUMANOIDS: SEVEN<br>
          SPECTACULAR CASES</a></h2>

          <h5>Apr 28, 2023 (0:46:03)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Among the most spectacular of all UFO encounters are cases 
          of landings and humanoids. These cases are not nearly as common as sightings, and yet 
          they have been occurring all over the world for many decades. Encounters like these 
          are very important because they are so close that any explanations of misperceptions 
          or hallucinations become completely untenable. These cases also remove any doubt that 
          UFOs are in fact craft occupied by living beings. These are the kinds of cases that 
          answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon, such as what are they, 
          where do they come from and why are they here?</p>

          <p>This video presents seven dramatic cases, one from each decade, starting in the 
          <b>1950s</b> and moving forward to the <b>2010s</b>. Each case involves a landed 
          craft and humanoid figure. These cases also provide considerable physical evidence 
          in the form of landing traces, physiological effects and even photographs.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 25, 1952</b>: Musician William Squyres of Frontenac, KS was driving to work 
          early in the morning when he saw a metallic craft with portholes hovering alongside 
          the road. To his amazement, he could see a humanoid figure in the front of the craft. 
          When he shut his car door to get a closer look, the craft zoomed upward and was gone. 
          He called the police and they returned to the site where they found landing traces. 
          Project Blue Book came to investigate. They were unable to explain what he saw and 
          officially declared the case UNIDENTIFIED.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 21, 1967</b>: Ronnie Hill (age 14) was in his backyard in Oriental, NC when a 
          strange odor filled the air and the animals became deathly quiet. Looking up, he saw a 
          UFO. Moments later, a smaller 9-foot white sphere began darting around. Ronnie dashed 
          inside and retrieved his camera. Coming back outside, he saw that the sphere had landed. 
          Then, to his shock, a small humanoid figure stepped out from behind the craft. Ronnie 
          quickly snapped a photograph.</p>

          <p><b>Jan 27, 1978</b>: It was nighttime when four teenagers trespassed onto a farmer’s 
          property in Frodsham, England to go pheasant hunting. As they hid in the undergrowth, 
          they were baffled by the appearance of a metallic craft floating just above the nearby 
          River Weaver. Without warning, the craft moved toward them and landed in a field a short 
          distance away. A herd of cows became immobilized. The boys watched in fear as two 
          humanoids exited the craft and walked up to one of the cows, placing a weird cage-like 
          device around it. Fearing that they were next, the boys fled. Each experienced a strange 
          and unusual physiological reaction as they ran away.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 22, 1982</b>: Donald Shallcross had just returned to his home in Slanesville, 
          WV in the wee hours of the morning when his pets started acting up. Venturing outside, 
          he saw what he thought was a plane about to crash in the fields near his house. 
          Informing his family, he went to go help. Instead of a plane, however, he came upon a 
          landed UFO and was confronted by a strange helmeted humanoid. The figure said he was a 
          watchguard and had some important messages for all humanity.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 6, 1996</b>: Lloyd Karambakuwa (age 17) was woken up in his home in Chipadze, 
          South Africa by a loud clicking noise. Going outside to investigate, he was frightened 
          to see a short glowing figure with a strange uniform and odd-shaped head moving quickly 
          around the property across the street. Realizing it wasn’t human, he ran back inside. 
          Unknown to him, a nearby security guard was also drawn outside by the same weird noise, 
          and also saw the figure. The next morning, Lloyd found very strange footprints at the 
          site.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 2001</b>: After a day of fishing on the River Tocantins in Brazil, Vinicius 
          DaSilva and Marta Rosenthal were driving home when they thought they had a flat tire. 
          Strangely, nothing was wrong. But then Marta pointed to the right over the river where 
          a large craft was hovering just above the river’s surface. A humanoid stood on a ledge 
          and a hose-like device extended down into the water. It appeared to be sucking water up 
          into the craft.</p>

          <p><b>2011</b>: World-famous archaeologist Klaus Honninger, his wife and several others 
          were conducting a dig in the Ocucaje desert in Ica, Peru when a large UFO rose up from 
          behind a hill and began to emit smaller orb-like spheres. After a few moments, the orbs 
          returned into the craft which disappeared behind a hill. It apparently landed, because 
          minutes later, Klaus was confronted by two tall humanoids with elongated skulls. They 
          told Klaus to have no fear, that they had been on Earth long before humans were here, 
          and they had an important message to share. Afterward, Klaus was able to actually 
          photograph the object as it moved away.</p>

          <p>Each of these cases provides a fascinating glimpse into the UFO phenomenon, providing 
          both evidence of ET reality, and also warnings from the ETs themselves about how we are 
          treating each other and our planet. With many thousands of cases like these, it’s clear 
          that we are not alone.</p>

          ENCOUNTERS</a></h2>

          <h5>Apr 21, 2023 (1:19:08)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Imagine you’re driving along a remote highway late at night 
          when you see a glowing object ahead of you right above the road. As you approach, you 
          can see that it’s actually a saucer-shaped craft, a UFO! Suddenly, the UFO swoops down 
          towards your car and starts following you down the highway. It circles around your car, 
          hovering right above it, on either side, coming closer and closer. Your radio becomes 
          filled with static, your headlights dim, and the car engine begins to sputter. Then the 
          UFO takes control of the car!</p>

          <p>This may sound incredible, but it happens more often than you might think. In fact, 
          there are hundreds of UFO-car chases on record, coming from all over the world. These 
          are among the most dramatic of UFO encounters. They have been occurring since at least 
          the <b>1950s</b> up to the present day. For some reason, UFOs love to play cat-and-mouse 
          games with unwary drivers who suddenly find themselves driving fast and furiously to 
          outrun a UFO that chases them down the highway, sometimes for hours!</p>

          <p>The question is why? What exactly is it about people driving cars down highways late 
          at night that attracts so many UFOs? This video presents dozens of cases of UFO car 
          chases, from the <b>1950s</b> onward, and coming from all across the planet. Here are a 
          few of them.</p>

          <p><b>1952: Gene Povey</b> and two others are driving through the remote Storms River 
          Pass in south Africa. Coming around a corner, they see a UFO blocking the road. The UFO 
          zooms toward the car, forcing the driver to swerve to avoid it. The interior of the car 
          lights up as bright as day. The UFO darts off, but little do they know their encounter 
          has only just begun.</p>

          <p><b>1967: A bus-driver</b> is hauling a load of titanium along the A32 Highway near 
          Reading, England. Without warning the engine to his bus dies. He notices a large object 
          hovering above the road ahead of him. He gets the engine started and moves forward when 
          the engine dies again. The object is now much closer. Afterward, the man’s hands and 
          fingers are numb and a persistent toothache disappears.</p>

          <p><b>1970: Reidar Salvesen</b> is driving late at night to Kristiansand, Norway when a 
          UFO approaches and swoops down ahead of him. He stops the car to observe when the craft 
          zooms forward and hovers right over the hood. He falls to the ground, the windshield 
          shatters and the object lifts up. Afterwards, his vision is altered, his mouth and tongue 
          are numb, and the skin on his hands is burned to the point of peeling.</p>

          <p><b>1972: The Hall family</b> is returning to their home in Thief River Falls, MN. Mr. 
          Hall notices a light pacing their car. They use a flashlight to blink at the craft, and 
          it starts blinking back at them! Then, the object zooms towards their car, sending down 
          a beam of light on them. The radio quits, the engine starts coughing, and a powerful heat 
          envelops the witnesses. Mrs. Hall, who had a bad cold, realizes that her cold is gone!</p>

          <p><b>1978: Three truckers</b> are driving along the I-70 near Indianapolis, IN when a 
          brilliant blue-white light shines down from above, causing all three truck engines to 
          sputter. The beam lasts for about five seconds, then disappears. But when one of the 
          trucks calls out on the CB, “Hey, UFO, if you have your ears on, I want to go with you,” 
          the beam of light returns. The incident is witnessed by more than 100 people!</p>

          <p><b>1981: Linda Brown</b> and two others are driving along the I-93 near Meredith, NH 
          when they notice a UFO pacing their car. Scared, they exit the freeway and drive to a 
          gas-station. The UFO follows and drops down to 100 feet right over the station, where 
          it hovers in place. After ten minutes, Linda drives away, and the UFO continues to follow 
          them.</p>

          <p><b>1982: Frances Collins and Maggie Yeend</b> are driving late at night along the 
          remote South Coast Highway in Australia. Suddenly an object drops down from the sky 
          right in front of their car and zooms towards them in a collision course. For the next 
          hour, the object follows them down the highway, scaring the daylight out of them.</p>

          <p><b>1984: Carolyn Green</b> and her son Timothy are driving along Highway 85 in Seven 
          Points, TX when a UFO appears overhead and begins to wreak havoc with their car. The 
          lights of their car begin flashing on and off by themselves and the UFO appears to take 
          control of the car, which is now driving by itself.</p>

          <p><b>1985: Ezio Zuliani</b>, his wife and son notice a strange light following their car 
          as they travel to their home in Bergamo, Italy. The object follows them for three hours, 
          getting closer and closer. When they pull into a gas station, the object drops down and 
          hovers right above them, in full view of several witnesses. When they leave the station, 
          the object still follows them!</p>

          <p>These are just a small sampling of the many cases of UFO-car chases. It appears that 
          the UFO occupants are intentionally chasing cars down highways to announce their presence 
          and let people know they are real! It’s certainly an experience that the witnesses will 
          never forget!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO and extraterrestrial encounters are known for their high 
          levels of strangeness. Whether a sighting, a face-to-face encounter with ETs or an 
          onboard experience, each case usually contains unique and unusual elements. Each case 
          adds to our knowledge of alien contact. This article (and video) presents eight cases 
          that illustrate the bizarre high-strangeness of UFO/ET encounters.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE ONE</b>: In <b>1976</b>, Kathleen Teti stepped outside her home in Norristown, 
          PA to an incredible sight. A saucer-shaped craft hovered ten feet above her front yard. 
          The dome atop the craft had huge windows, through which Kathleen could see two gray-type 
          ETs. Even more strange, she saw two humans who had apparently been taken onboard. She was 
          so close, she could see the consoles, chairs, and what appeared to be a red shag rug on 
          the floor and walls!</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE TWO</b>: In <b>May 1976</b>, Christina Bryant, her daughter and a friend drove 
          late at night on a desert highway outside of Alamogordo, NM. After seeing weird lights 
          overhead, they found themselves on a small dirt road confronted by a strange sight: a 
          uniformed police officer with his cruiser partially overturned in a ditch. The next 
          thing they knew, they were back on the highway missing hours of time. Later under 
          hypnosis, Christina recalled that the policeman was actually an ET, and his cruiser was 
          a landed craft. She and her daughter were both taken onboard.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE THREE</b>: On <b>Sep 9, 1976</b>, Bill and Lenda Pecha (and their children) 
          were drawn out of their home in Colusa, CA by a huge craft with blazing bright lights 
          drawing electricity out of the nearby powerlines, causing a power-failure. When the 
          craft came over their house, Bill became alarmed; he could physically feel the 
          electricity coming off the craft. The family ran to their car and drove off in a panic. 
          The UFO chased them all the way to their friend’s house who also saw the object. 
          Meanwhile, other witnesses in town observed the display. A weird after-effect is that 
          the UFO caused a pear-tree which had already borne fruit to blossom again!</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE FOUR</b>: Florida Malboeuf could hardly believe her eyes when, on <b>Jan 6, 
          1977</b>, she looked out her apartment window in downtown Montreal, Canada. A metallic, 
          saucer-shaped craft was coming in for a landing on top of the roof of the building 
          across the street. She watched in shock as two humanoids exited the craft and peered 
          over the edge of the building. After the craft took off, her son went to investigate 
          and found a circle of re-frozen ice on the building-top, along with odd child-sized 
          footprints.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE FIVE</b>: On <b>Jun 27, 1977</b>, Edna Owens and her four children went 
          shopping at the local market in the small town of Telford, TN. Returning home, they 
          saw what appeared to be a shooting star. But then it began darting around and soon 
          revealed itself to be a flying saucer. When the object came towards them, they fled 
          into the house and turned off all the lights. The object hovered over the house and 
          began circling it. Frightened, the family fled the house. The daughter got an 
          electrical shock when she touched the car door. The family drove off and the object 
          followed. The youngest daughter became so hysterical, she had to be hospitalized for 
          a week.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE SIX</b>: On <b>Aug 6, 1977</b>, Tom Dawson of Pelham, GA left his trailer with 
          his dogs to go fishing at the local pond. As soon as he arrived a saucer-shaped craft 
          dropped from the sky and hovered just above the ground. Tom, his dog and a herd of nearby 
          cattle became frozen to the spot. The craft disgorged a half-dozen short, bald, uniformed 
          ETs who began to talk in a foreign language. Two approached Tom and conducted a weird 
          physical exam. The case went from strange to bizarre when a voice came out of the craft, 
          saying the name of a famous labor leader who had mysteriously disappeared a few years 
          earlier.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE SEVEN</b>: On <b>Jan 3, 1979</b>, Meagan Quezet and her son Andre were drawn 
          outside their home in Mindalore, Africa by the barking of their dog, Cheeky. Following 
          him down the street, they came upon a landed craft. Out stepped several humanoid figures. 
          They walked around the craft and appeared startled to see they were being observed. One 
          approached Meagan and bowed in greeting. Meagan said, “Hello!”</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE EIGHT</b>: In <b>mid-Jul 1988</b>, witnesses at a wild animal reserve in 
          Lugo, Spain were shocked to see a 250-foot-long craft with purple lights hover overhead. 
          Without warning it sent down a beam of light onto a herd of elephants. To their absolute 
          astonishment, 26 elephants rose up the beam of light and into the craft, which darted 
          away.</p>
          
          <p>The above cases show how truly strange and bizarre UFO encounters can be. They show 
          that we are not alone in this universe, and that we still have much to learn not only 
          about ourselves, but about the people we share this universe with. Earth is being 
          visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrials. And the UFO contact experience is far 
          more common than many people realize.</p>

          HAVE A<br>
          SENSE OF HUMOR?</a></h2>

          <h5>Apr 7, 2023 (1:05:03)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Do aliens have a sense of humor? It’s a question many people 
          have asked. And the answer appears to be, yes! In fact, there are many cases where ETs 
          show a sense of humor. There are accounts of ETs smiling, laughing and showing in many 
          ways that they, like humans, do find some things funny. These cases reach back decades 
          and are still occurring today.</p>

          <p>Many contactees have seen this firsthand. This video presents more than a dozen 
          cases in which aliens exhibit a sense of humor very much like our own. One example 
          comes from contactee, Bill Foster. After being abducted many times, he wondered how 
          big the craft was. Sometimes it seemed small, and other times large. Finally, he 
          decided to ask how big the craft was. Bill says that the gray seemed to laugh and 
          told him, “It’s as big as we need it to be.” It wasn’t the only time his questions 
          amused the ETs.</p>

          <p>In his book, “Secret Life,” researcher David Jacobs Ph.D. presents a case involving 
          a young girl who was taken onboard a craft. During a physical exam, the ETs cut off a 
          lock of her hair and then, in an act of apparent humor, held it up to his bald head 
          and showed it to the other grays!</p>

          <p><b>In 1910</b>, two witnesses in St. Merryn, Cornwall, England saw a red object 
          hovering in the clouds. Through the portholes of the craft they saw a group of 
          little humanoids chattering and pointing down at the witnesses, laughing.</p>

          <p><b>On Oct 15, 1954</b>, an anonymous gentleman from Shamsabad, Iran saw a 
          “short young man” looking down at him from inside a UFO. The witness was frightened 
          by the sight, but then noticed that the UFO pilot was laughing at him, apparently 
          at the witness’s frightened expression.</p>

          <p>A similar case occurred <b>in 1959</b> in Aubagne, France. Miss Moulet had just 
          gone outside to hang her laundry when an egg-shaped object hovered overhead. Looking 
          down at her through a porthole were about twenty human-looking ETs, smiling and 
          laughing.</p>

          <p>A strange case of UFO contact was revealed by John Keel. <b>On Nov 17, 1966</b>, two 
          policemen from Gaffney, South Carolina came upon a landed saucer. Out stepped a short 
          humanoid who began asking them all kinds of question. He seemed puzzled that the two 
          officers were dressed in identical uniforms. After answering the ET’s questions, the 
          officers asked the ET where he was from. The ET seemed to think the question was funny 
          and began laughing, and then returned into the craft, which promptly took off.</p>

          <p>Whitley and Ann Strieber present a case from a woman who, in the <b>summer of 1968</b>, 
          was driving with her daughter outside of Flagstaff, Arizona when they were both taken 
          onboard a craft. Although initially quite frightened, the woman was amazed when the human-
          looking ETs communicated telepathically, smiling and laughing during the entire time she 
          was onboard. Interestingly, the ETs were teaching her how to pilot the craft.</p>

          <p><b>On Feb 7, 1969</b>, Thiago Machado of Pirassununga, Brazil encountered a landed UFO 
          and occupants. Thiago was smoking a cigarette, and the ETs appeared to find this behavior 
          quite amusing.</p>

          <p><b>In Jul of 1972</b>, a woman was woken by a sound outside her home in Lower Hutt, 
          New Zealand. Looking out the window, she saw a UFO hovering over the building next door. 
          Inside were two male human-looking figures. As she watched, one of them said something 
          to the other, which was apparently funny, as the ET began to laugh.</p>

          <p><b>On Oct 19, 1975</b>, a couple was driving with their dog near Llangothlin in New 
          South Wales, Australia when a UFO began pacing their car. The dog became scared and 
          jumped into the front seat and began acting up. Looking up into the craft, they saw 
          several human-looking figures staring down at them. One of them was pointing at them, 
          apparently laughing at the fact that their pet dog was jumping all over inside the car.</p>

          <p>A bizarre case comes from researcher, Salvador Frexiedo. In the <b>summer of 1976</b>, 
          a busload of passengers in Santander, Colombia were shocked when twenty short humanoids 
          emerged from the forest and stopped the bus, then began rocking back and forth, 
          eventually tipping it over on its side. The humanoids began laughing hysterically and 
          then, on cue, ran off back into the forest.</p>

          <p><b>In Aug of 1977</b>, Viktor Alexandreovich was boating on the Dnieper River in 
          Ukraine when he was taken onboard a craft piloted by human-looking ETs. He says that 
          the ETs were very kind, smiled often and had a strong sense of humor.</p>

          <p>An amazing case of ET contact occurred in an unknown location to teacher, Mark 
          Andrews. On <b>Sep 3, 1995</b>, he was invited onboard a craft to help ETs become 
          oriented to Earth life. While onboard the craft, he was assigned to a young boy who 
          pointed at him and began laughing with amusement. He told Mark, “I am assigned to be 
          your baby sitter!”</p>

          <p>These are just some of the many accounts of ET humor. Cases involving ET humor are 
          more common than many people realize. They show that ETs are more like us than different, 
          and that they share the same emotions we do.</p>

          EXPERIENCER AND<br>
          FILMMAKER JOHN YOST</a></h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Mar 31, 2023 (1:19:55)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1973</b>, seven-year-old John Yost of Pittsburgh, PA had 
          an experience that would alter the course of his life forever. He awoke in the middle of 
          the night and went to the bathroom to get a drink of water. As he stood in front of the 
          sink, something very strange happened.</p>

          <p>Looking in the doorway, he saw a strange figure. He could hardly believe his eyes. It 
          was Ultraman, a superhero character from one of his favorite TV shows. What was Ultraman 
          doing in his house? How did he get there? What did he want?</p>

          <p>John stared in shock. This was impossible. And yet it was happening. He had no fear, 
          until suddenly, John felt a strange sinking feeling, like the floor was coming out from 
          under him. Dazzling colored lights began swirling around him. Sensing danger, he began 
          to fight.</p>

          <p>Without warning, there was a strange shift. John had been standing in the bathroom 
          facing Ultraman, who stood in the hallway above the stairs. Now their positions were 
          reversed. How had this happened. Ultraman reached forward and placed his hand on John’s 
          shoulder. John found himself tumbling head over heels down the wooden staircase.</p>

          <p>He screamed in fear, waking up his parents who rushed out of their bedroom to find 
          John at the bottom of the stairs. He tearfully told them what happened. Puzzled and 
          alarmed, they quickly searched the house for any intruders. There was no sign of 
          Ultraman. They were all baffled and had no logical explanation.</p>

          <p>The next day, John went outside to play. After returning home, his mom checked to 
          make sure that he was okay and saw a strange mark on his shoulder, precisely where 
          Ultraman had placed his hand. “What’s this?” she asked.</p>

          <p>John explained that Ultraman had touched him on that spot. Shortly later, John’s 
          father took him to the doctor. He told John not to tell the doctor anything about this 
          Ultraman nonsense. And when John let it slip out, his father became angry and made it 
          very clear that John was never to talk about Ultraman again.</p>

          <p>John was a good boy, and obeyed his parents. From this point on, he buried this 
          memory and never told anyone about it. It became his deep dark secret, something that 
          no one could ever know.</p>

          <p>Life continued on as normal. He grew up, and started a career with the Department 
          of the Treasury. One day he realized that this was not what he wanted to do with his 
          life; instead he wanted to work in the television and film industry. He quit his job 
          and pursued his dreams. He was very successful and enjoyed a wonderful career making 
          commercials, TV shows of all kinds, and working with many famous people in show 
          business. He was happy.</p>

          <p>Then one day, he was in Borrego Springs, CA working on a new project. Work had ended 
          for the day, and he and his crew were enjoying the evening and watching the beautiful 
          desert skies studded with stars when somebody showed, “Look, what’s that!” A brilliant 
          light hung in the sky. It was a UFO!</p>

          <p>John felt a sudden, strange sinking feeling. He recognized the feeling. He was 
          instantly transported to age 7, when he had his face-to-face encounter with Ultraman. 
          Panic swept over him and he fled to his room, where he broke down crying. What was 
          happening to him? Why was this sighting affecting him so profoundly? What did this 
          have to do with Ultraman?

          <p>John struggled with anxiety, fear and confusion. Something very significant was 
          happening to him and he needed answers. He began to do research. The only explanation 
          that seemed to fit was that he was a UFO experiencer. He finally sought out hypnosis. 
          His memories came roaring back. Now he knew what happened to him.</p>

          <p>Realizing that he was not alone, and that there were likely millions of people out 
          there struggling with these same experiences, John decided to document his journey in 
          the only way he knew how, with film. He began working on a documentary, chronicling his 
          experiences and those of several others. And so the film Alien Abduction Answers was born. 
          Creating the documentary was a labor of love. Different from most documentaries on the

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">USOs! Unidentified submersible objects! For many years, there 
          wasn’t much research into the subject of USOs. UFO research focused mostly on flying 
          objects. But today UFO investigators have come to realize that our oceans are swarming 
          with extraterrestrial craft. Mile for mile, one of the top producers of USO reports is 
          the stretch of water off the southern California coast, known as the Santa Catalina/San 
          Pedro channel. There are now more than 150 documented cases on record.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than a dozen dramatic cases of UFO/USO activity in the Santa 
          Catalina channel. These are cases involving multiple witnesses, radar confirmation, 
          photographs, films, physiological effects and more.</p>

          <p><b>Jan 28, 1953, Rex Hardy Jr</b>, a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy and others 
          observed four silver discs over Malibu, CA. They estimated that the objects were each the 
          size of a B-36 aircraft, and moved at about 1,200MPH. This was the first of several 
          sightings in that area that would cause great concern for Air Force officers.</p>

          <p><b>Dec 16, 1953, Clarence ‘Kelly’ Johnson</b>, designer of the U2 aircraft was with 
          his wife near Pt. Mugu when saw a strange object moving against the prevailing winds. 
          At the same time, the crew of a Lockheed WV2 aircraft sighted the same object from Long 
          Beach. Project Bluebook officers investigated the case and told the witnesses they had 
          seen nothing but a “lenticular cloud!”.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 22, 1957</b>, two UFOs were detected on radar at LAX Airport. When the objects 
          approached to within ten miles, the Air Force scrambled F-89 jets, at which point, the 
          radar station lost power. Minutes later, the objects appeared during a missile test at 
          Pt. Mugu and were filmed. Unfortunately, the film was classified and has never been 
          released. The next day, the objects returned and were seen by hundreds of people and 
          again caught on radar.</p>

          <p><b>2004</b>, an anonymous civilian witness driving along the Pacific Coast Highway 
          near Torrance saw three glowing objects only 400 feet over his car. A few months later, 
          he and his entire family saw a disc-shaped craft while boating near Catalina Island.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 8, 2005</b>, a group of eight shark fishermen were off the coast of Newport 
          Beach when the saw a bright object approaching. It hovered a few miles away only 100 
          feet above the water. Then it started to come closer, causing some of the fishermen 
          to become concerned. One of the men, however, received a strong impression of positivity 
          from the object.</p>

          <p><b>Dec 2, 2006</b>, a wedding party at Newport Beach were along the beach when an 
          eerie silence descended over them. Looking up, they saw the shadow of an object they 
          estimated to be about 500 feet in diameter.</p>

          <p><b>Jun 1963</b>, the best man at a wedding in Laguna Beach was taking a nighttime 
          walk along the beach when he saw a glowing object with portholes just beneath the waves. 
          He first thought it might be a submarine, but realized that it was far too close to the 
          shore.</p>

          <p><b>1972, Robert Snyder</b> was visiting his friends in Pacific Palisades when they 
          all saw a disc-shaped object covered with colored lights approach from the north. As 
          they watched, the object descended into the water and then began to move underwater 
          faster at extremely high speeds.</p>

          <p><b>Jun 1980</b>, two people were camping at Point Mugu when they saw what they first 
          thought were buoys with lights on them floating just offshore. Then suddenly, the objects 
          rose into air, hovered for a half-minute, and darted away in the blink of an eye.</p>

          <p><b>Mid-1980s</b>, art director, Xander Smith revealed his sighting of brilliant lights 
          offshore of Malibu. He first thought it might be a big-money production of a movie until 
          the next day when he learned that more than a hundred people in the area had seen the 
          “mysterious lights” and nobody could explain them.</p>

          <p><b>1989-1994</b>, Many witnesses along the coast from Marina Del Rey to Rancho Palos 
          Verdes observed many objects floating under the water. In one instance, a very large USO 
          was seen releasing smaller ones. In another incident, witnesses were warned off by 
          mysterious government agents.</p>

          <p><b>1996, Jason Brooks</b> was with his girlfriend at Salt Beach in Dana Point when 
          they observed what they thought was a boat. Then suddenly the “boat” took off straight 
          up and began performing incredible darting maneuvers for 30 minutes. The next day, the 
          USOs were back!</p>

          <p>Throughout the <b>1960s</b>, a resident of Rolling Hills observed numerous UFOs/USOs. 
          Then one evening, an object hovered over her car, causing EM effects, then moved directly 
          over her house. That evening, her father (who worked for the Navy designing ULF antenna) 
          experienced what she believes was direct contact.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">How would you like to fly a UFO? It’s not as unique as you 
          might think. In fact, contactees all over world are reporting this kind of experience. 
          According to the "FREE" study, about thirteen percent of contactees say that they have 
          piloted a UFO. Researcher Grant Cameron has written a book (Sky Pilots) profiling dozens 
          of cases!</p>

          <p>In <b>January of 1973</b>, fourteen-year-old Dolly Safran had a missing time encounter 
          with a UFO over her home in the Florida Everglades. This was not Dolly’s first encounter; 
          this had happened many times before. But this time was different. After the encounter, 
          Dolly sat down and meditated and was able to fully recall what happened. And what Dolly 
          remembered astonished her. She had been taken onboard the craft and was given the 
          opportunity to work directly with the ETs. Dolly agreed, and the ETs asked her what 
          she would like to learn. Dolly asked if she could learn how to pilot the UFO craft. The 
          ETs agreed. So began Dolly’s experiences as a UFO pilot. She began having fully conscious 
          encounters where she was taken onboard and trained how to fly the UFO. The craft is an 
          alive creature embodied by a fifth-dimensionalentity that Dolly calls “Tlera.”</p>

          <p>Dolly first had to be tested, physically, neurologically and especially psychically. 
          After that, she was taught all about the gravitational and magnetic field lines of planets 
          and how the aliens harness the energy of a planet to maneuver their craft. Dolly then sat 
          with the grays and went through their flight school, watching and learning all the 
          procedures and processes involved with piloting UFOs.</p>

          <p>After five years of intensive training, Dolly was finally ready for her first flight. 
          She sat down in the pilot seat, joined psychically with the craft (which is itself an 
          alive entity) and traveled to another planet beyond our own solar system. Says Dolly, 
          “You can actually feel yourself becoming weightless. You’re magnetically charged. Your 
          body becomes somewhat weightless. That’s what it feels like. You’re not constrained by 
          anything. You become part of the thing that you’re in.”</p>

          <p>Flying the craft is done without any instrumentation. They are all driven psychically. 
          “Learning to fly is the same no matter what kind of craft you’re in,” Dolly explains. 
          “Navigation on a craft is a little bit different, depending on where you are and what 
          you’re doing. If you’re in the atmosphere of a planet, you’re going to fly different if 
          you’re going to travel over a dimensional shift. So different applications of the flying 
          occur at those times. If I’m dimensionally shifting, I’m using hard telepathy, all 
          telepathy. I don’t guide the ship manually in any way. It’s all telepathy. I’m becoming 
          a partner mentally with the craft, with the engines of the craft and with the systems 
          of the craft.”</p>

          <p>Dolly learned how to fly the craft interstellar distances to virtually any point in 
          the universe. This is done through a process the ETs call opening a “light gate.” This 
          allows them to traverse vast distances in a matter of seconds. “A giant flash of light 
          opens up,” Dolly says. “One of the reasons we can’t see out is because it’s so brilliant 
          it would probably blind all of us, including Tlera. Because he has sight sensors. So, 
          we’re protected from it. But there’s a brilliant flash of white light around us. And 
          we go through it. We actually jump and go through the light. And when we do, we are no 
          longer in this dimension. We’re not in any other dimension. We are in the in-between 
          place. We are in a doorway, and it’s instantaneous. It happens within a split second. 
          I can feel a shift, and so can Tlera, and so can everyone else onboard that ship. You 
          feel it, you know it just happens. It rips right through you. It’s like -- you knowwhen 
          an elevator’s comng down, and you’ve got that jump, that weird gee force? That’s what 
          it feels like. Because it can disorient you. There’s a lot of electromagnetic energy 
          all around you. And it happens that fast.”</p>

          <p>Dolly’s experiences with piloting a craft are among the most extensive on record. She 
          reports traveling all over the Earth, across the solar system and to many distant parts 
          of the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond. She has had fun joy rides, very serious missions, 
          close-calls almost resulting in accidents and much more. In this video, Dolly talks 
          about her lifelong experiences working and living with the ETs and piloting their craft 
          for various missions. Dolly is able to explain exactly how the UFOs fly and what their 
          agenda is on this planet.</p>

          <h5>Mar 10, 2023 (1:08:08)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Did you know that airports are a powerful magnet for UFO 
          activity? There are dozens of cases coming from across world, reaching all the way 
          back to the <b>late 1940s</b> and continuing up to the present day. These are not just 
          sightings; many involve UFO landings and humanoids of all types. These cases represent 
          outstanding evidence of the reality of UFOs and the extraterrestrial presence on our 
          planet. Many of these cases are widely viewed by professional observers, pilots, 
          meteorologists, air-traffic controllers and more. Some involve physical landing traces. 
          Some are confirmed by radar. And quite a few involve actual photographs of the craft.</p>

          <p>It might seem surprising that UFOs would be attracted to a location that is not only 
          crowded with people, but also contains radar arrays designed to detect incoming 
          aircraft. On the other hand, these cases also have a certain level of logic to them. 
          Airports are designed for aircraft to both land and take off. So, in a way, it’s 
          fittingly appropriate that UFOs should be attracted to them. And as these cases show, 
          they are, and in large numbers.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 10, 1948</b>: Chihuahua Airport in Mexico is visited by a hovering disc. A few 
          days later, on Mar 10, four discs appear over Central Airport in Mexico City in view of 
          hundreds of witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>Apr 7, 1950</b>: Multiple witnesses at Logan Airport in Boston, MA view a dramatic

          Tradewinds Airport in Amarillo, TX. After staying for five minutes, the object departs, 
          leaving burn marks.</p>

          <p><b>Apr 16, 1950</b>: a 6-foot-wide metallic disc is seen by multiple observers to 
          crash on the runway at Laredo Airport, TX. A short humanoid exits and collapses on the 
          ground.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 1950</b>: Claude Blondeau is at Guyancourt Airport in Yvelines, France when

          discs circle overhead for three hours.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 27, 1952</b>: A disc-shaped craft hovers over MacDonald Airport in Manitoba, 
          Canada. When struck the light from the rotating beacon, the object darts away.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 27, 1952</b>: An object lands at Marignane Airport in France. Two years later, 
          on Jan 4, 1954, another object lands at the same exact airport.</p>

          <p><b>Sep 4, 1954</b>: A UFO lands at the Santa Maria Airport in Azores. After landing, a 
          blond human-looking ET exits the craft and approaches the airport guard.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 15, 1965</b>: Controllers, pilots and employees at Canberra Airport in 
          Australia are stunned by the appearance of UFOs hovering 5000 feet overhead.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 28, 1965</b>: Grano de Oro Airport at Maracaibo, Venezuela is visited by 
          three luminous discs which are tracked on radar.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 6, 1965</b>: An AF sergeant at Concepcion Airport in Hualpencillo, Chile 
          sees a 90-foot-wide saucer land at the end of the runway. Shortly later, three ETs

          <p>These are just a few of the many incredible airport-UFO encounters all over the 
          world. Among the most dramatic is the <b>2006 incident at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport</b>. 
          So many cases! The question is why? Are they putting on displays? Are they checking up

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Cases of UFO Healings are not new. They have been occurring 
          for more than 100 years. Most major researchers have multiple cases, and they are 
          reported by all kinds of people from all over the world. There are more than 300 
          documented cases, and they are recognized as a regular feature of UFO contact.</p>

          <p>This video presents ten shocking cases of UFO healings. Each case contains surprising 
          and unique elements that offer profound insights into the aliens and their agenda on our 
          planet.</p>

          <p><b>Marla (pseudonym) from Marysville, WA</b> had suffered for years from kidney 
          disease, and developed a large gallstone which necessitated the surgical removal of 
          her gallbladder. In <b>Jan 2015</b>, following a visit by short, large-headed entities 
          in her bedroom, Marla awoke to find a strange surgical scar on her abdomen. It was 
          deep, but pain-free, had no blood, and healed with incredible speed. When she went to 
          doctors, they were shocked to find that her gallstone had been removed, but her 
          gallbladder was still there!</p>

          <p><b>Maria M. Rivera of Aguada, Puerto Rico</b> was suffering from cancer all through 
          her body when <b>(in 2006)</b> she and her family had a UFO sighting followed by many 
          visits by gray ETs. Then Maria was taken onboard a craft and underwent a painful 
          operation. Afterward, she went to the doctor and was shocked to discover that the 
          cancer was now gone.</p>
          
          <p><b>On Jul 19, 1988</b>, Diane and Phyllis (mother and daughter) drove to their home 
          in Johannesburg, South Africa and were stopped by a human-looking female who guided 
          them onto a craft. From age 13, Diane had suffered from chronic jaundice. The ETs 
          healed her and gave them both warnings about huge environmental catastrophes soon to 
          strike our planet.</p>

          <p><b>In 1986</b>, Richard T., paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, was enjoying an evening 
          on the beach in La Jolla, CA when a huge torpedo-shaped craft hovered overhead. Richard 
          was taken into the craft, wheelchair and all. Onboard, he saw several short humanoids 
          and then blacked out. Over the next few days, Richard’s paralysis disappeared. He was 
          healed.</p>

          <p><b>On Aug 30, 1979</b>, Jean Cyr (a retired Canada Army officer) and his family were 
          drawn outside of their home in St. Eustache, Quebec by an odd humming sound. They saw 
          a glowing metallic disc rise from the fields near their home. This began a series of 
          encounters which was witnessed by many of their neighbors and local airport officials. 
          Jean began waking up with unexplained marks on his body. After several encounters, Jean, 
          who had severe multiple sclerosis, was healed.</p>

          <p><b>In the mid-1930s</b>, a 13-year-old boy suffering from tuberculosis found himself 
          on his deathbed. Then he had a “dream” that he was taken into a weird craft and healed 
          by strange-looking figures. With no idea of aliens or UFOs, he couldn’t explain what 
          happened. He only knew that he had somehow been healed. It wasn’t until the <b>1950s</b>, 
          that he heard about UFOs and aliens that he understood his experience.</p>

          <p><b>In Mar 1977</b>, Carmina of San Juan, Puerto Rico was confronted by a strange 
          human-looking gentleman who had somehow managed to get past the guards in her secured 
          office building. The man informed her that he was an ET, and that Carmina’s daughter 
          should continue her UFO research with investigator, Jorge Martin, and that Martin 
          himself was being spied on by US intelligence officers. Carmina, who had been diagnosed 
          with a cyst in her breast, received the shocking news that her cyst had miraculously 
          disappeared.</p>

          <p><b>Richard Rylka</b>, a well-known New Jersey UFO contactee, had developed a large 
          tumor on his forehead. While in Atlantic City, he was visited by human-looking ETs who 
          took him onboard a healed his tumor. Rylka, whose tumor had been seen by all his friends 
          and family, was cured.</p>

          <p><b>In 1979</b>, Faina Maksimovna was facing surgery to remove a tumor on her thyroid. 
          Frightened of surgery, Faina prayed to God. To her shock, that evening she was visited 
          by three human-looking figures who proceeded to enact a healing on her. When Faina later 
          went to see her doctors, they were baffled and amazed to see that her tumor was gone.</p>

          <p><b>In Dec 1989</b>, Mae, a 60-year-old waitress from Mississippi was being forced to 
          retirement due to severe arthritis. Driving home, a UFO dropped down over her car and 
          pulled her onboard. Mae found herself surrounded by several figures who placed a “kind 
          of rod” over her body. The next morning, her pain was gone. She was healed.</p>

          <p>These ten cases show that people from all walks of life are being healed by many 
          different types of ETs. They show that healing is one of the primary ET agendas, and 
          that ETs have the ability to heal almost any kind of illness, condition or disease.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO sightings are not as random as they might seem. 
          Researchers discovered long ago that UFOs find certain locations very interesting. 
          These are called “UFO attractors,” and there are a lot them. Some include military 
          bases, nuclear power stations, prisons, graveyards, rocket launches, mines, 
          schoolyards, drive-in movie theaters and more. Another well-known UFO attractor 
          is dams and hydroelectric stations. However, there has not been much research into 
          these types of cases. Until now!</p>

          <p>This video presents more than 30 cases of UFOs hovering over dams. And not only 
          hovering, but landing too. Several cases also involve humanoids. The evidence for 
          these cases is astounding. There are multiple witnesses, physiological effects, 
          electromagnetic effects, landing traces, photos and more. In some cases, the UFOs 
          appear to be siphoning water from the reservoirs, or electricity from the power 
          stations. Some of the dams are visited over and over again.</p>

          <p>These cases reach back from the modern age of UFOs in <b>1947</b> to the present 
          day, and are occurring all over the world: Australia, Canada, Europe, Canada, the 
          United States, South America and more. Why are UFOs visiting our dams? Are they 
          examining our technology? Do they want the water and electricity? Or are there 
          other reasons? The answers are here!</p>

          <p><b>Jul 10, 1947</b>. Three glowing V-shaped objects circle over the Owyhee Dam 
          in Parma, ID for more than 10 minutes.</p>

          <p><b>Feb 10, 1953</b>. Army security guard Jessie E. Kent observes two glowing discs 
          hovering 150 feet above the dam and reservoir at the Richard Quartermaster Depot in 
          Richmond, VA.</p>

          <p><b>May 1953</b>. Two men driving over the bridge of Loch Raven Dam in Baltimore, 
          MD are confronted by a UFO which stalls their vehicle. Five years later, on <b>Oct 26, 
          1958</b>, two men driving over the same bridge have the same experience. Over the next 
          decades, many other encounters occur.</p>

          <p><b>1950s</b>. An employee of Davis Dam in AZ reports that UFOs would repeatedly 
          hover over the dam, apparently drawing electric power from the hydroelectric station.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 1962</b>. Two men fishing at the Foote Dam reservoir in Oscoda, MI see a 
          huge saucer-shaped craft covered with multi-colored lights right overhead. Moments 
          later, fighter jets from nearby Wurtsmith AFB chase it away.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 24, 1962</b>. Railroad employee Lester Sandler reports seeing a UFO over 
          the Horsetooth Reservoir and Dixon Dam area. Moments later another witness reports 
          a UFO landing at the base of the dam.</p>

          <p><b>Jun 20, 1964</b>. Two witnesses see a UFO and humanoids hovering over the 
          Gorge Dam in Newhalem, WA. U.S. fighter jets chase the object away and a govt 
          investigation follows.</p>

          <p><b>1964</b>. AF Officer Frank Kinsey and his brother see a “USO” rise out of 
          Lake Casitas. Through a porthole, they see a humanoid looking back at them. 
          Kinsey quickly snaps of a photo.</p>

          <p><b>Jan 11, 1966</b>. Hundreds of people observe a UFO maneuver for several 
          hours at low elevation over Wanaque Reservoir and Raymond Dam. Ten months later 
          on <b>Oct 10</b>, the UFO returns and is witnessed by hundreds and even photographed.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 30, 1970</b>. Security guard Almiro Martins de Freitas shoots at a UFO 
          as it hovers directly over the Funil Dam. Almiro is struck by a beam of light 
          which temporarily blinds him. The UFO leaves, but returns multiple times over 
          the next week.</p>

          <p><b>Jun 1971</b>. a family has three encounters in a week by the Clearwater 
          Dam in Piedmont, MO, including one “USO” in the reservoir itself. One year later, 
          more sightings occur, generating national headlines.</p>

          <p><b>1971</b>. A man camping in Jamison Valley by the Warragamba Dam in New South 
          Wales, Australia walks upon a landed UFO and several humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>Feb 1973</b>. Numerous witnesses (including police) observe a UFO dive into 
          the waters of Wheeler Dam in Huntsville, AL.</p>

          <p><b>Jun 5, 1973</b>. Two fishermen at Rio Dam in Port Jervis, NY see a glowing 
          UFO sucking water up from the lake. Looking through a porthole, they see a strange, 
          brown-skinned humanoid.</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the many other cases occurring all over the world: 
          Dillon Dam in CO, Castelo de Bode Dam in Portugal, Fort Phantom Lake Dam in TX, 
          Blewett Falls Dam in NC, Palmar Dam in Uruguay, Muskrat Dam in Canada, Alfalfal 
          Dam in Chile, Wivenhoe Dam in Australia, El Tunal Dam in Argentina, Scammonden 
          Dam in England, and so many others.</p>

          <p>There are too many cases to deny. UFOs are showing a strong interest in our 
          dams and hydroelectric stations. They are clearly keeping tabs on our technology, 
          and in some cases, appear to be taking water and electricity. These cases show 
          that UFOs are not imaginary, but are highly technological craft piloted by 
          extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">What’s the most common day to see a UFO? The answer may 
          surprise you: the <b>4th of July!</b> That’s right, Independence Day produces more UFO 
          reports than any other day. The question is, why? Are people mistaking fireworks 
          for genuine UFOs? Or is something else going on here?</p>

          <p>An examination of the UFO reports made on the fourth of July shows some interesting 
          patterns. Many do involve fiery glowing orbs, or what may very well be sky lanterns, 
          also known as party lanterns. These are small paper balloons set aloft with a small 
          candle. They can rise up to 4000 feet and from a distance, look very much like a UFO.</p>

          <p>But the fact is, there are literally hundreds of cases where this explanation simply 
          does not fit! Some do look like orbs, however, sky lanterns fizzle out after fifteen 
          minutes, and many of these orb sightings last much longer. Also, orbs cannot turn at 
          right angles, stop still in the sky, or accelerate at high speeds, as many of these 
          orbs do. Furthermore, many of the Independence Day UFO encounters involve structured 
          craft, metallic saucers complete with portholes and multicolored lights. Some cases 
          also involve actual humanoids. Clearly the fireworks explanation doesn’t fit.</p>

          <p>There are so many cases involving UFOs seen on the Fourth of July that it is 
          clear something very profound is happening here. Fireworks appear to be a UFO 
          magnet. Many of the witnesses have come to the conclusion that UFOs are coming 
          down to watch the fireworks show. ETs love fireworks!</p>

          <p>But it might be more than this. Remember, on the Fourth of July, millions of 
          people all across the United States flock outside at night and stare upwards. 
          Could it be that the extraterrestrials are aware of this and are using this day 
          as an opportunity to announce their presence. The answer appears to be a big YES! 
          Because many of these reports involve UFOs that not only watch the fireworks show, 
          but they put on a show themselves. They will flash their lights, dart around, and
          put on a fantastic display for the stunned audience.</p>

          <p>This video presents dozens of cases in which UFOs have appeared during fireworks 
          shows all across the United States. Here is what some of the witnesses are saying:</p>

          <p>“We were watching fireworks, which were to our east. I noticed the UFO to the 
          north, but said nothing to no one. I observed it for two minutes as it moved 
          silently eastward, then suddenly reversed direction as it picked up speed. Then 
          assuming its original course once again, it moved slowly upwards and out of sight.” 
          –1963, Greensboro, NC.</p>

          <p>“There was a tremendous flash of lightning at the same time a firework went off 
          in the sky. I looked up and saw an absolutely huge saucer-shaped object sitting right 
          over the ‘mountain’ we were next to.” –1965, Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY.</p>

          <p>“When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft. It hovered right above 
          the poplar trees at the end of the street, where we were all gathered.” –1977, Federal 
          Way, WA.</p>

          <p>“[It was] a disc-shaped object displaying multicolored lights in a circle, hovering 
          at what seemed to be 100 feet above us and the gathering crowd.” –1978, Nashua, NH.</p>

          <p>“It made no sound. I was scared to death…I wanted to hide under the car…I wanted to 
          scream, but couldn’t. I realized I was not supposed to remember this happening. I kept 
          telling myself, I will remember. The craft’s size was huge, bigger than the fairgrounds 
          bleacher area.” –1980, St. Paul, MN.</p>

          <p>“My brother was watching the fireworks when all of a sudden he went as white as a 
          ghost. My mother shouted out, ‘Oh, my God!’ I went to see what was going on…it was the 
          weirdest thing ever, a disc-shaped with small portholes going around its midsection.” 
          –1982, Hermosa Beach, CA.</p>

          <p>“Most people don’t get to see a craft that close and distinct. I even saw the molding 
          around the windows…Three Nordic-looking men in white, with blond hair, staring at us as 
          if we were mere cattle. I could see them from the belly up, not sure if they were standing 
          or sitting. They had no apparatus on at all. I never took my eyes off it until it was gone 
          from sight.” –1999, Lancaster, PA.</p>

          <p>There are too many cases to deny. The aliens are coming down to watch the fireworks 
          shows, and they are also putting on displays themselves. And in fact, these are more 
          than just simple sightings. Every single one of these cases are actually Close Encounters 
          of the Fifth Kind! Fireworks are evidently an effective method to call down UFOs out of 
          the sky.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">As a general rule, when someone is visited by gray ETs, they 
          find themselves paralyzed, unable to their body. “Don’t worry, we won’t hurt you,” the 
          grays say. “Come with us.” It is perhaps the most common phrase the ETs say. In cases 
          where people have no fear, they are often given freedom of movement. Others do have fear 
          and have a fight or flight response. In some cases, witnesses break free from their 
          paralysis and react by attacking the extraterrestrials and punching them in the face, 
          choking them around the neck, or getting into some sort of physical altercation. It 
          happens more often than you might think. This video presents more than a dozen cases in 
          which people actually assaulted gray aliens by pushing, kicking, choking or punching.</p>

          <p><b>NOV 3, 1975</b>: Woodcutter Travis Walton and six others encounter a UFO at treetop 
          level in the Sitgreaves National Forest, AZ. Travis runs under the UFO and is taken 
          onboard. Confronted by grays, he physically fights with them.</p>

          <p><b>APR 5, 2017</b>: A young man from Del Valle, TX is woken up by his dogs barking. 
          Searching the house, he sees two grays in his mother’s bedroom. He jumps forward and 
          punches one of the grays in the head. When the second one grabs him, the witness punches 
          him too. And then a third gray comes in.</p>

          <p><b>WINTER 1985</b>: Patsy Wingate of Knoxville, TN wakes up to see three grays 
          approaching her. Reacting in self-defense, she jumps up and chokes the middle gray, 
          snapping its neck. Astonished, the other two grays scoop up the gray and flee!</p>

          <p><b>1985</b>: Tim, a sports-instructor from New Iberia, LA wakes up to find himself 
          lying on a table onboard a UFO. He breaks free from his paralysis and begins to 
          explore. Grays rush in and Tim begins punching the grays, one after another. Suddenly 
          a crowd of them surround him and Tim realizes he is out-numbered.</p>

          <p><b>2016</b>: “Gary” from Cumbria, England wakes up one morning and encounters a 
          gray in his living room. Angry at the repeated intrusions into his home, he grabs the 
          gray around the neck. The gray starts screaming telepathically, “Let go, let go!” A 
          few days later, the grays come again, and Gary is ready. This time he punches one in 
          the face.</p>

          <p><b>1982</b>: Former Marine officer, “Ramon,” is taken onboard a UFO in San Fernando, 
          CA. He becomes angry when the grays try to collect genetic material from him. Summoning 
          his combat training, he breaks free of the paralysis, jumps up and pushes one of the 
          grays down to the floor.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 13, 1975</b>: Sgt Charles Moody of Alamogordo, NM is not happy when a UFO 
          lands in front of his car, grays come out and try to pull him from his car. He opens 
          his car door, knocking one of the grays down. Then he bunches up his fist, and pounds 
          one of the grays in the face.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 27, 1975</b>: David Stephens and his friend are driving near Oxford, ME when 
          a UFO takes control of their car. Next, grays appear and pull David onboard. When they 
          try to undress David for an exam, he resists. He jumps off the table and hits one of 
          the grays.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 2010</b>: Kevin is woken in his home in Bangor, ME and pulled into a craft by 
          gray aliens. When they insert a rod inside his nose, Kevin becomes hostile. He swings 
          out his leg and kicks one of the grays, slamming it hard into the wall, where it 
          collapses in a heap.</p>

          <p><b>UNDATED</b>: An anonymous teenager in high school (location not given) has a very 
          unusual dream where grays enter his room and begin to do a weird procedure on his back. 
          Having scoliosis, he thinks they might be healing him. However, scared and angry that 
          the ETs were not communicating with him, he quickly throws a left hook as hard as he 
          can at the gray’s cheek. The gray lets out a high-pitched scream.</p>

          <p>There are more cases like these. John Mack has a case in which a man, angry at 
          being examined, jumps up and chokes a gray. Contactee Dolly Safran (from Georgia) 
          recalls several instances where she was onboard and people reacted violently by 
          punching the grays, pushing them down, or even breaking their arms. These cases 
          show that, when confronted with the unknown, humans often become very fearful and 
          react with violence. Even more importantly, they show that people can overpower the 
          grays, who appear to be physically more fragile than humans. These cases have a lot 
          to teach us both about humans and the grays, and our relationships to each other.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While many people speculate about the nature and origins of 
          the UFO phenomenon, cases of landings and humanoids make it clear what they are. UFOs 
          are craft, and they are piloted by extraterrestrials. These kinds of encounters represent 
          the core of the UFO phenomenon. They teach us the most about these visitors to our world, 
          who they are, where they come from and their agenda on our planet. Humanoid encounters 
          have been occurring for a very long time, and are far more common than many people realize.</p>
          
          <p>In fact, according to the Roper Polling Organization, as many as one in fifty people may 
          have had these experiences. They occur all across the planet to all kinds of people. The 
          state of California leads the U.S. in the sheer number of encounters. And the cases of 
          humanoids show a corresponding and profound variety of humanoid types. Here are twelve 
          cases of landings and humanoids from the Golden State.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 18, 1927</b>: While driving outside the town of Bakersfield, schoolteacher Richard 
          Sweed comes upon a landed UFO. As he approaches, it makes a loud whining noise, accelerates 
          upward and disappears into the distance, leaving behind a circle of glassified sand.</p>

          <p><b>Dec 1957</b>: Edmond Rucker of El Cajon hears a loud roaring noise outside his home. 
          Venturing outside, he is confronted by a landed UFO and four strange humanoids who speak 
          to him about their mission on Earth.</p>

          <p><b>Apr 14, 1964</b>: A truckdriver on a highway outside of Chico comes upon a domed 
          disc which hovers above his truck causing it to stall. When the UFO lands nearby, the man 
          exits his truck and approaches the craft. He touches the craft and is amazed to hear 
          strange voices coming from inside.</p>

          <p><b>Apr 1964</b>: Gloria Biggs, her husband and mother are driving outside the desert 
          town of Baker when they see a domed-shaped object landed next to the highway ahead of 
          them. As they approach, the UFO takes off. They examine the landing site and discover 
          a weird depression in the ground.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 31, 1966</b>: Two women driving by a construction site near San Francisco see 
          a metallic disc hover at low altitude. Through the windows of the craft, they are amazed 
          to see the silhouettes of several “people” gesticulating at them.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 4, 1973</b>: While driving along the 118 Freeway in Simi Valley, Gary Chopic 
          observes a small triangular-shaped craft with a transparent dome on top. Inside he sees 
          a human-looking figure at the controls. And then the humanoid sees him!</p>

          <p><b>Dec 17, 1973</b>: Driving at night outside of Paso Robles, Sergeant Lance Mathias 
          and his friend Mike Andrews see a hovering spherical UFO sending down a beam of light. 
          Going to investigate they are confronted by two metallic-suited humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>1974</b>: The Overfelt family of Ramona are drawn out of their farmhouse by a huge 
          glowing sphere which lands on a hill near their home. All the animals on the farm react 
          to the presence of the UFO. The Overfelts call the police, who refer them to 
          investigators, who have some important advice.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 6, 1977</b>: While watching over a factory in Sylmar, security guard Douglas 
          Kriese is amazed to see a UFO drop out of the sky and land in a field nearby. He 
          approaches it and hears it making a buzzing sound, and feels it emitting an intense 
          heat. He immediately calls the police.</p>

          <p><b>1977</b>: Two Native American brothers from Colusa contact investigators after a 
          UFO keeps landing near their ranch-home and a long-haired big-nosed humanoid keeps 
          entering their can through the walls. When investigators arrive, they see the UFO 
          themselves!</p>

          <p><b>Oct 31, 1976</b>: a husband a wife motorcycling through downtown Los Angeles see 
          a spherical UFO hovering below the level of the buildings. The sunlight strikes the 
          craft, making it transparent. They then see human-looking figures staring down at them. 
          The wife quickly flashes them the peace sign.</p>

          <p><b>Nov 29, 1988</b>: Maria X. of Sherman Oaks is in her bedroom with her young son 
          when grays show up and render her unable to move. Maria is concerned about her son, but 
          falls unconscious. The next morning, her son exclaims that “My aliens came back!” and 
          provides a vivid description of what it’s like to be pulled by the ETs through the wall.</p>

          <p>These twelve cases are just the tip of the iceberg of UFO landings and humanoids in 
          California. And yet, these cases here represent an accurate cross-section of UFO activity 
          across the world. They also show that humanoid encounters often present good hard evidence 
          in the form of landing traces, electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological 
          effects, and other stunning confirmation.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Face-to-face encounters with humanoids and onboard UFO 
          experiences are the cutting edge of UFO research. Cases like these teach us the most 
          about extraterrestrials, who they are, where they’re from, and their agenda on our planet. 
          Humanoids come in all shapes and sizes, and encounters with them are surprisingly varied. 
          People all over the world have been having encounters with humanoids for a very long time. 
          Each location on the planet has a long history of humanoid encounters. One area with a 
          surprisingly rich history is the state of Arizona. What follows are ten cases from the 
          Grand Canyon state, each with its own insights into the nature and origins of the UFO 
          phenomenon.</p>

          <p><b>AN ALIEN ON THE ROAD</b>: On <b>June 9, 1960</b>, a woman was driving with her 
          husband and two children east of Globe. Everyone but her was asleep when she saw what 
          appeared to be a young child about to cross the road. Then it turned its head and what 
          she saw shocked her: the figure was not human!</p>

          <p><b>GROUP OF MUSICIANS ABDUCTED</b>: It was <b>1968</b> when a group of musicians 
          finished a gig in Phoenix, and drove out of town to party. Without warning, a UFO 
          appeared and hovered overhead. The next thing they knew, they were being examined by 
          gray aliens.</p>

          <p><b>ABDUCTION IN THE WHITE TANK MOUNTAINS</b>: On <b>June 20, 1980</b>, three women 
          traveled to the White Tank Mountains to investigate recent UFO sightings. Suddenly 
          strange lights approached and all three women fell unconscious, then woke up hours 
          later. Under hypnosis, one of them recalled being taken onboard, where she was given 
          profound messages from the ETs.</p>

          <p><b>UFO ENCOUNTER IN JAKES CORNER</b>: In <b>August of 1987</b>, five people were 
          outside their home in Jakes Corner when they saw a UFO rise up from a mountain and 
          hover overhead. Then it moved over their home and stayed there. At this point, all 
          but two of them went inside, and a bizarre encounter ensued during which the ETs 
          showed a strange interest in the men’s feet.</p>

          <p><b>THE RUBY ALIEN</b>: In <b>August of 1988</b> Sam visited an abandoned ghost 
          town in Ruby, near the southern border of Mexico, he heard a strange whooshing 
          sound overhead. Nothing strange was visible, but shortly later, he was amazed to 
          see a short humanoid wearing a weird jumpsuit standing nearby. Sam just happened 
          to have a camera, and he quickly snapped a stunning photograph.</p>

          <p><b>A RIDE ABOARD A FLYING SAUCER</b>: In the <b>late 1980s</b>, a retired pilot 
          was driving through the desert near Cave Creek when his car stalled. As he checked 
          the engine, a handsome blond man walked out of the wilderness, announced that he 
          was an extraterrestrial, and offered the man a ride aboard his flying saucer.</p>

          <p><b>CONTACT IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA</b>: At <b>2:00 a.m., on February 20, 1991</b>, 
          Sheri was woken up by a huge UFO hovering outside her home. She then found herself 
          being taken onboard where she met several different types of ETs, who gave her 
          strange silver medicinal pills, and also a mineral sample. Sheri saved both and 
          handed them over to researchers. Then there were the photos!</p>

          <p><b>ONBOARD ENCOUNTER IN DEWEY</b>: On <b>September 28, 1991</b>, Leslie woke up 
          in her home to find her bed surrounded by grays. More stranger-looking ETs appeared, 
          and Leslie was pulled through the wall of her  home into a craft. During the encounter 
          she was taken to the other side of the world and deep into the ocean. It was 
          an experience which would leave her utterly transformed.</p>

          <p><b>TOUCHED BY A GRAY</b>: In <b>February 1997</b>, Louise and her husband moved 
          into their new home in Chandler. One month later, three grays appeared in her bedroom. 
          One of them stepped forward and touch Louise on the forehead. She blacked out only to 
          discover remarkable evidence of her close encounter.</p>

          <p><b>SOMETHING NOT FROM THIS WORLD</b>: In <b>February 2005</b>, after a long day 
          working at the local ski resort, Eric woke up in his home in Flagstaff to see a gray 
          alien standing over his bed. Freaked out, he flipped his middle finger at the ET and 
          blacked out. Only a few weeks later, he received startling confirmation that he 
          wasn’t the only one in his family having encounters.</p>

          <p>These ten accounts provide an accurate representation of humanoid encounters. They show 
          how truly bizarre and varied contact with extraterrestrials can be. They show that 
          encounters can occur anytime and anyplace, and can have a profound effect on a person’s 
          life.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Imagine driving along a remote highway and you see someone 
          stick out their thumb, asking for a ride. You don’t pick up random hitchhikers, but 
          for some reason, you feel compelled to stop. The hitchhiker, you now realize, looks 
          weird, is dressed strangely, and starts to behave in unusual ways. Suddenly you realize 
          that the hitchhiker is not human. This may sound crazy, but the fact is, there are more 
          than a dozen cases on record that fit this exact pattern. Extraterrestrial hitchhikers! 
          It happens more often than you think.</p>
          
          <p><b>1956</b>: Army officer Virgil Atkinson is driving along the Pacific Coast Highway 
          in Santa Monica, CA when he picks up two young sailors. After dropping them off, he finds 
          himself being followed by a UFO.</p>
          
          <p><b>Oct 10, 1967</b>: Norman C is driving to his home in Lakewood, CO when he is stopped 
          by an odd tall man alongside the highway. The man begins asking him very odd. As the man 
          walks off, a gigantic UFO appears overhead.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 1973</b>: Frank Bales is driving through WA when he stops to pick up two tall 
          strangers wearing white robes. Frank is amazed to see that they have six fingers on each 
          hand! The hitchhikers give him predictions and tell him they are “the Watchers.”</p>
          
          <p><b>1973</b>: Musician Steve Boucher is driving with his fellow musicians along a highway 
          in Ontario, Canada when they pick-up a hitchhiker. The next thing they realize, a UFO lands 
          on the road in front of them, and the hitchhiker is leading them onboard the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 18, 1974</b>: Edmoana Toews and Nuria Hanson are driving through a remote area 
          of British Columbia, Canada when they are followed by a UFO. At some point, they feel 
          compelled to give a strange hitchhiker a ride. So begins an ordeal that leaves them 
          convinced that the man was an ET.</p>
          
          <p><b>1978</b>: Gina and Lois traveling to Phoenix, AZ see a strikingly handsome blond-
          haired, blue-eyed man thumbing a ride. They never pick up hitchhikers, but can’t stop 
          themselves. The man tells them to have no fear when their car is levitated off the road 
          and into a UFO.</p>

          <p><b>2004</b>: An anonymous pilot driving through the remote desert outside of Yuma, AZ 
          stops to give a man a ride. As they converse, the hitchhiker reveals that he is an 
          extraterrestrial in disguise, working on Earth to help humanity.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 25, 2001</b>: Irina and her father drive near Mishor, Ukraine and see a very 
          handsome man on the side of the road asking for a ride. They give the man a ride. The 
          next thing they know, they are paralyzed, lose control of their car, and discover that 
          the hitchhiker is actually an alien.</p>

          <p><b>Jun 12, 2003</b>: Mr. Zilmerman is on his way to work in Limeira, Brazil when he 
          feels compelled to stop and pick up a hitchhiker. The man in his car is not normal. He 
          is very short, has cat-like eyes, a bald head, a pale oily complexion, smells awful and 
          wears a one-piece tight jumpsuit with bizarre thick-soled shoes. He’s definitely not 
          human!</p>

          <p><b>2004</b>: Mr. O.B., drives near Salisbury, VA and picks up a hitchhiker. O.B., 
          is shocked to see that the man has huge eyes, pale skin, thin blond hair and unusual 
          features. He warns O.B. about the dangers of our political system. From there, things 
          get weirder.</p>

          <p><b>Undated</b>: Dakota is driving between Window Rock and Chinle, AZ and stops to give 
          a man a ride. He now sees that the man is very odd-looking, with thin limbs, very pale 
          skin, and is wearing a shimmering white jumpsuit. Next, they come upon a flying saucer 
          blocking the road.</p>

          <p><b>Undated</b>: Four men leave a wedding reception near their home in Guatemala City 
          when they agree to give a man wearing a cowboy hat a ride. Shortly later, they find 
          themselves confronted by a UFO. The hitchhiker disappears and reappears, and leads all 
          of them onto the UFO.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1, 2018</b>: An anonymous trucker driving through Corsicana, TX sees a tall, 
          thin, green-skinned figure standing alongside the highway as if looking for a ride. 
          Shocked by the man’s strange appearance, he doesn’t stop. But luckily, he does have an 
          operating dash-cam, which captures the entire incident on video!</p>

          <p>With more than a dozen cases, it is clear that this is a thing. Aliens are hitching 
          rides from unwary drivers all over the world. In case after case, the people who have 
          this experience find themselves taking a route they don’t normally take. When the 
          hitchhiker appears, they feel compelled to stop and pick them up. Only then do they 
          notice that the hitchhiker is strange in appearance, dress and behavior. In many of 
          these cases, the drivers end up being taken onboard a UFO! It is one of the most bizarre 
          types of UFO encounters on record, and yet, the chances are, the cases presented here 
          are likely just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It goes by many names. Some call the experience UFO abduction. 
          Others call it a Close Encounter of the Third Kind. Some prefer to call it Contact, or an 
          Onboard UFO Experience. Whatever term you prefer, the truth is that many people are being 
          taken onboard extraterrestrial craft. In fact, some researchers believe that millions of 
          people have had this experience.</p>

          <p>Dolly Safran has been a fully conscious UFO contactee her whole life. Beginning at age 
          fourteen, she has been taken onboard hundreds (if not thousands) of times. She has spent 
          days, weeks, and sometimes months with the ETs, learning from them, working with them, 
          flying the craft, interacting with various ET types, traveling to other star systems and 
          more.</p>

          <p>In this interview (Part Five of a series) Dolly describes the very controversial aspect 
          of UFO encounters that many people call abductions. She doesn’t call them that. And neither 
          do the ETs. The extraterrestrials are contacting people and bringing them onboard, but they 
          call this process, “Gathering the Children.”</p>

          <p>What is the reason for people being taken onboard? Why are the ETs contacting so many 
          people? Is it for our benefit or theirs? Dolly answers these questions and more, and not 
          from speculation, but from firsthand experience of her many interactions with them.</p>

          <p>The reasons, says Dolly, are many. The ETs are here to heal, to teach, to guide, to warn…to 
          help enlighten people to their own psychic abilities. There is a lot of fear and disinformation 
          surrounding the UFO contact experience. Many people experience terror and trauma and believe 
          they are being taken against their will. But after living and working with the ETs for many 
          years, Dolly knows that this is not what is actually happening.</p>
          
          <p>The ETs are not here to scare people or harm them. They are here to help. Dolly has been 
          onboard the ET craft hundreds of times when people are picked up for medical exams, 
          consultations, guidance, healings and more. She has not only experienced this herself, she 
          has watched it happen to countless other people. She has been onboard and counseled others 
          during their own close encounters.</p>
 
          <p>While some may perceive the experience as scary and negative, the truth is far different. 
          Dolly shares her own experiences with people being taken onboard and healed, taught, guided, 
          awakened to their own contacts. Dolly’s story of UFO contact is one of the most extensive on 
          record. Her case is well-documented with multiple supporting corroborative witnesses, 
          medical records that show her own healings (and implants,) impressive photographic and 
          video evidence and much more. After watching this video, you will see that contact, despite 
          all the fear and misinformation, is in fact a positive experience, one that is for the 
          betterment of all humanity.</p>

          <p>For those who want to know more, Dolly’s lifelong experiences (recalled fully consciously 
          and without the use of hypnosis) are presented in the book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is among the closest and rarest of UFO encounters. It 
          almost never happens. But the fact is, on extremely rare occasions, people have collided 
          with a UFO. Planes, trains and automobiles, and even boats -- all have crashed into UFOs. 
          Vehicle accidents occur every day. But is a very short list of people who have crashed 
          into an extraterrestrial craft. This video presents a comprehensive look at UFO collisions. 
          And not only UFOs, but in a few cases, collisions with extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p><b>PLANES</b>: While there are literally thousands of cases involving UFOs seen from

          of a USO striking a boat. So many cases! These encounters show that UFOs are not 
          infallible and that accidents do happen. And these are only the cases we know about. 
          How many more have not been reported, or are being covered up by the military?</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Among the closest of UFO encounters are cases involving 
          strange humanoids. It’s one thing to see an unidentified flying object from a distance, 
          it’s quite another to see a gray alien, have missing time or even be taken onboard a 
          craft. It’s these types of encounters where we learn the truth about UFO contact and 
          what it’s like to meet an extraterrestrial face-to-face. This video presents five true 
          accounts of humanoids and high strangeness from the state of Nevada. Of course, humanoids 
          are seen all over the world. And Nevada is no exception. In fact, Nevada has many accounts 
          of this kind. What follows are five of the weirdest and most bizarre.</p>

          <p><b>SHARLEEN’S ONBOARD ENCOUNTER</b>. One <b>evening in Jul of 1964</b>, Sharleen 
          Nicholson was six-months pregnant when her house in Las Vegas began to vibrate with 
          a buzzing noise. A light flooded through the windows. Venturing outside, she saw a 
          saucer landed in the field by her home. Sharleen became filled with a strange calmness. 
          The next thing she knew, she was back inside her home. By morning, she had forgotten 
          the entire experience. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy. A few months later, 
          during a baby shower, someone mentioned the word “UFO,” and the memory of her 
          encounter returned. Had she been taken onboard? She wasn’t sure.</p>

          <p><b>BOY SHOOTS A GRAY ALIEN</b>. <b>Early one morning in 1970</b>, a father took 
          his 7-year-old son rabbit hunting in the desert east of Reno. He stayed in the car 
          drinking beer while his son took his rifle and searched out his quarry. After 
          shooting a rabbit, he set his sights on another. That’s when he saw movement out 
          of the corner of his eye. Looking in that direction, he was shocked to see a short 
          gray-skinned figure with large dark eyes. When it raised its hand toward him, the 
          witness swung his rifle around and shot. The strange creature dropped to the 
          desert floor. Filled with fear and remorse, the boy dropped the rifle and ran back 
          to his father who disbelieved him and told him to go back and get the gun. Upon 
          returning to the site, the strange humanoid figure was gone. But up in the sky was 
          a large cigar-shaped craft. The next thing the boy knew, he was taken onboard.</p>

          <p><b>MISSING TIME IN INDIAN SPRINGS</b>. On the <b>evening of Dec 3, 1983</b>, a 
          small group of airmen from Creech AFB in Indian Springs hiked a few miles off-base 
          to have a little beer-keg party. Growing tired, one of them decided to walk back 
          to the base dorms. But his journey back was interrupted. Growing cold, he hunched 
          down to warm up. The next thing he knew, he was waking up to find a man hold a gun 
          to his head. He was sleeping on a couch in the home of a complete stranger. He and 
          the homeowner were mystified as the house was protected by a tall fence and a 
          guard-dog, and all the doors and the windows had been locked from the inside. 
          Even stranger, there was a large incision on his abdomen.</p>

          <p><b>THE ABDUCTION OF ALEX PODOVICH</b>. On <b>Nov 7, 2002</b>, Las Vegas resident, 
          Alex Podovich woke up to find a strange glowing light descending upon him. His body 
          became paralyzed and he felt himself moving through the air. The next thing he knew, 
          he was lying naked on a strange bed in a weird room, surrounded by humanoid figures 
          with weird eyes. A bizarre ring-like device was fitted over his head. So began a 
          series of encounters with apparent extraterrestrials. At first Alex had no fear. 
          But he soon came to believe that the ETs were taking his reproductive material to 
          produce hybrid children. Later experiences with the ETs would seem to confirm this. 
          Alex then decided that these encounters were not in his best interests and he began 
          to resist them.</p>

          <p><b>HUMANOIDS ON ROUTE 95</b>. On the evening of <b>Dec 8, 2006</b>, a married 
          couple decided take a road trip from Las Vegas to the remote desert town of Beatty, 
          NV. Their journey took them along Route 95 which led them through the town of Indian 
          Springs and deep into the Nevada desert. At some point during their trip, they noticed 
          a light hovering ahead of them on the highway. Slowing down, they saw that the light 
          was actually a scraft hovering only a few hundred feet high. Even more shocking, 
          through the windows they could see several strange humanoid figures both sitting down 
          and standing, all of them looking down at them from above. It was instantly clear to 
          both of them that the figures were not human.</p>

          <p>As can be seen, Nevada has no shortage of humanoids and high strangeness. About 87 
          percent of the state is owned by the Federal Government. It is also the location of 
          the infamous Area 51, believed by many to be an area involving the reverse-engineering 
          of UFO craft. Whatever the case, it’s clear that something very profound is happening 
          in the Silver State.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Sightings of UFOs are undeniably interesting, but far more 
          compelling are cases involving humanoids. Face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrial 
          entities provide a profound insight into the UFO phenomenon and the alien presence on 
          our planet. ETs are being seen all over the world, in every state, in every country. 
          This video presents six extraordinary and unusual cases of humanoid entities from the 
          state of New York. Each of these cases are strange and unique, and each offers an 
          opportunity to further our understanding of extraterrestrials.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE ONE: IMPLANTED BY ALIENS</b>. In <b>1955</b>, eight-year-old Richard Price 
          was playing near his home in Lansingburgh, NY when he encountered short humanoid ETs 
          and a landed UFO. He was taken onboard the craft, physically examined and given an alien 
          implant. Further procedures followed. Richard was then returned, but his life would never 
          be the same. His case became on of the first involving the scientific study of an alien 
          implant.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE TWO: A UFO LANDS ON MAIN STREET</b>. On <b>July 31, 1967</b>, security guard 
          Sidney Zipkin came upon a UFO landed in a parking lot along Main Street in Churchville, 
          NY. To Sidney’s shock, two short humanoids raced into the craft which took off straight 
          up. Sidney told his superiors who could see that Sidney was badly shaken. Unknown to 
          any of them, numerous other people, including several police officers, saw UFOs in the 
          same area at the same time.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: THE NEWFIELD UFO FLAP</b>. On the <b>evening of October 24, 1967</b>, 
          two young boys, Donald Chiszar and Pat Crozer were outside their home in Newfield, NY 
          and looking up, saw a large structured craft with portholes hovering about 130 feet 
          overhead. Looking through the portholes, the saw two strange-looking humanoids staring 
          down at them. The craft took off, but the next night it returned. So began a massive 
          UFO flap involving hundreds of witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FOUR: “THEY WERE NOT HUMAN.”</b> On the <b>evening of June 10, 1972</b>, 
          an anonymous nurse, her mother and infant son, drove home along Coleman Station Road 
          in Millerton, NY. Without warning, a massive craft dropped from the sky and hovered 
          overhead only 150 feet away. Looking through the portholes, they saw five gray-skinned 
          humanoids looking right back at them. They raced away and to their shock, the UFO began 
          to follow them home.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FIVE: “I AM NOT AFRAID OF THEM.”</b> On <b>February 26, 1983</b>, Monique 
          O’Driscoll drove with her daughter through upstate New York. Suddenly a massive 
          boomerang-shaped craft appeared low overhead. Monique mentally called out, “Don’t Go!” 
          To her amazement, the craft approached even closer. Two months later, Monique was 
          visited again, only this time she had missing time. Going under hypnosis, she recalled 
          being taken onboard the craft.</p>

          <p><b>CASE SIX: THE GROUP ABDUCTIONS</b>. In <b>September 1989</b>, a group of five 
          friends (James, Curtis, Petra, Brian and Paul) decided to spend the Labor Day weekend 
          at a trailer in a forested area of Saugerties, NY. That evening, the trailer filled 
          with light and they experienced a period of missing time. Over the next four years, 
          each time they spent time at the trailer, weird things happened. Under hypnosis, they 
          learned that they were all being taken together onboard a UFO.</p>

          <p>These six cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but together they show what it’s 
          like to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. Each have multiple 
          witnesses and additional corroborating evidence. And each makes one fact very clear: 
          we are not alone!</p>

          <h5>Dec 2, 2022 (1:00:01)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A UFO encounter can have many profound effects upon a 
          witness. A person can be physically affected, with such symptoms as injuries or 
          healings. An encounter affects a person mentally, challenging their world view. A 
          UFO encounter is also a very emotional experience and can trigger the full range of 
          emotions. But it goes beyond that. A close encounter can also transform a person 
          spiritually, triggering a wide variety of paranormal events. It’s not unusual for 
          contactees to experience OBEs, precognition, past-life memories, channeling, ghostly 
          encounters and more.</p>

          <p>One of the most bizarre effects, one that has received little attention, is that 
          following an encounter, some abductees experience spontaneous human levitation. As 
          unusual as this may sound, there are a growing number of cases. This video presents 
          more than a dozen cases of people who have levitated as a result of a UFO encounter. 
          It appears that ETs are teaching people how to levitate.</p>

          <p>One case comes from French researchers Aime Michel and Jacques Vallee. It involves 
          an anonymous medical doctor who had a close encounter that healed him of a wound on 
          his ankle and partial paralysis. Following the encounter, the doctor also experienced 
          two episodes of spontaneous human levitation.</p>

          <p>Whitley Strieber (author of Communion and other books) also reports having a spontaneous 
          levitation experience in his cabin in upstate New York. Strieber had just gone to bed one 
          <b>evening in 1986</b> when he found himself floating up to the ceiling. He rose up and down 
          several times before finally coming down to a landing in his bed. Following this experience, 
          he began to research these experiences and located two other contactees who reported nearly 
          identical events.</p>

          <p>Another well-known contactee who has experienced spontaneous levitation is Dr. Steven 
          Greer MD, founder of CSETI. Following an onboard UFO experience at age nineteen in his 
          hometown of Boone, NC, Greer found himself able to make leaping bounds, floating more than 
          twenty feet with each step. Some years later, he experienced another even more profound 
          episode of spontaneous levitation and floated a few feet above the ground for several 
          yards before coming in for a landing.</p>

          <p>These cases are not as rare as you might think. Researcher Budd Hopkins (author of 
          Missing Time and Intruders) uncovered two cases, both involving children who were having 
          UFO experiences. In each case, the children levitated on several occasions. In both cases, 
          the witnesses connected their levitations to their UFO encounters.</p>

          <p>A firsthand case comes from a man by the name of Maurice who reports that in <b>1966</b>, 
          he and his sister were taken onboard a craft. In the hours following the experience, both 
          found that they had the ability to levitate. They floated around the basement for an hour 
          and afterwards played with this ability in their yard. </p>

          <p>In <b>1951</b>, eight-year-old Mary Frank (who would later discover she was a contactee) 
          experienced a profound levitation event during which she flew down a corridor for several 
          yards, even turning corners, before coming to a soft landing on her feet. She tried several 
          times to duplicate it but was never able to repeat the experience.</p>

          <p>In <b>1953</b>, five-year-old Ramon (who would later become an officer in the Marines) 
          was taken onboard a UFO from his home in California. Following the encounter, he discovered 
          that he was able to levitate. In the days and weeks following his onboard encounter, he 
          levitated on at least three separate occasions, two episodes which were verified by 
          outside witnesses.</p>

          <p>In another case, a mother went to check on her infant child and discovered that her 
          baby was floating above her crib. Later, her child would report many UFO experiences, 
          including being taken onboard a UFO.</p>

          <p>Researcher Rey Hernandez reports on the case of Alberto Fernandez, a contactee from 
          Florida. On one occasion, Fernandez’s wife woke to find her husband floating above his 
          bed, sound asleep.</p>

          <p>Another amazing case comes from fully conscious contactee, Dolly Safran. Throughout 
          her life, Dolly has had numerous onboard UFO encounters. She also reports many cases of 
          spontaneous levitations. While most of these occurred as a young child, even as an adult 
          she experienced levitation, and on several occasions, the related phenomenon of telekinesis.</p>
          
          <p>Many other cases exist. The dozen cases presented here are likely only the tip of the 
          iceberg. One thing is clear, there is a connection between human levitation and the UFO 
          contact experience. ETs are teaching people a wide variety of psychic abilities, 
          including the ability to levitate.</p>

          <h5>Nov 25, 2022 (1:22:05)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Bigfoot is real! While mainstream science has refused to 
          accept the existence of the hair hominin, reports of the creature are now in the tens 
          of thousands or more. Cases reach back hundreds of years and continue to the present 
          day. While Bigfoot is reported all over the planet, the leading producer of cases is 
          the state of California.</p>

          <p>Native Americans have oral traditions about Sasquatch reaching back many hundreds 
          of years. But it wasn’t until the <b>mid-1850s</b> that written reports began to be 
          recorded. Initially reports came from prospectors, miners, hunters, and others. But 
          as the population of California began to grow, so did the number of Bigfoot encounters.</p>

          <p>While reports were coming in for more than 100 years, it wasn’t until a series of 
          events occurred in <b>1967</b> in the small then unknown town of Bluff Creek in 
          northern California that interest in the creature exploded. For the first time, the 
          term “Bigfoot” came into use, and for the first time people began to scientifically 
          study the creature.</p>

          <p>While some people still remain skeptical of the creature’s existence, those who 
          study the evidence usually come to the conclusion that Bigfoot is real. Even the famous 
          anthropologist Jane Goodall has stated her belief that Bigfoot is real. The evidence 
          comes in many forms including eyewitness testimony, footprints, handprints, hair samples, 
          fecal and urine samples, animal reaction cases, sound recordings, Bigfoot nests, and of 
          course, photographs and films.</p>

          <p>California has produced cases involving the entire range of Bigfoot cases, both 
          friendly and hostile. Perhaps the most common type of encounter is seeing a Bigfoot 
          cross the road in front of a vehicle while traveling late at night along a remote 
          highway. But many other reports exist of face-to-face Bigfoot encounters, Bigfoot 
          chases, hunters shooting at Bigfoot, Bigfoot confronting hikers, campers, fisherman 
          and more. Some people report being viciously attacked by Bigfoot, even including 
          kidnappings. But some also report remarkably friendly encounters. A few testify that 
          Bigfoot has even saved their life. Even stranger are accounts in which Bigfoot and 
          UFOs are seen at the same time.</p>

          <p>California has all these kinds of cases and more. People come from all over the 
          world to visit such hotspots as Willow Creek, Bluff Creek and more. But what many 
          people don’t know is that Bigfoot is seen all across the state, from the Sequoia and 
          Redwood forests in the north, to the fertile central valley in the middle, the high 
          deserts of Acton, Lancaster and Palmdale, the massive Angeles National Forest area, 
          all the way south to the remote mountains surrounding San Diego. There is virtually 
          no place in California that hasn’t produced solid Bigfoot reports.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than 100 cases of Bigfoot in California. And while these are 
          enough reports to gain a full understanding of Bigfoot behaviors and habitats, the truth is 
          that this is only the tip of the iceberg. The number of reports in California alone is in 
          the several thousands. And most people never even report their Bigfoot encounters. So any 
          estimate of the number of the cases is probably far lower than the actual number. What we 
          know about is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

          <p>The cases presented here show that California is very active with the mysterious 
          creature known as Bigfoot and Sasquatch. If you’d like to know more about Bigfoot in 
          California, please check out my books,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO contact has occurred all over the world to all kinds of 
          people. While some people report being very frightened by their encounters, others 
          report encounters that are not only benevolent, but healing. In fact, ET healings are 
          far more common than most people realize. There are literally hundreds of cases on 
          record, reaching back over 100 years and still occurring to the present day. This video 
          presents seven extraordinary examples of extraterrestrial healings involving people from 
          all across the planet. These seven cases show how truly advanced ETs are when it comes 
          to practicing medicine, and also show that healing humanity is main part of the alien 
          agenda.</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE: TERRY WALTERS</b>: Terry Walters of England reports a lifetime of 
          unusual events. In <b>2005</b>, Terry suffered from severe spinal problems and chronic 
          back pain. That is, until he found himself in an operating room onboard a UFO. Even 
          more surprising, he was being operated on by a reptilian humanoid. Following this, 
          Walters' back pain was gone. Soon Walters began having more onboard experience with 
          beautiful human-looking extraterrestrials. This initiated a spiritual awakening and 
          Terry began experiencing ghost encounters, precognition of disasters, memories of a 
          past-life as an Egyptian Pharoah and more. Walters also found he had the ability to 
          heal others of a wide variety of medical conditions.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: JEAN MIGUERES</b>. On <b>August 11, 1969</b>, Jean Migueres was driving 
          his ambulance near Rouen, France when a UFO appeared overhead. He heard a voice mentally 
          tell him, "Do not be afraid." Shortly later, Migueres suffered a head-on collision with 
          another vehicle, causing massive injuries. While trapped in the wreckage, an alien being 
          materialized next to him and said, "I am going to regenerate you by a procedure that is 
          not yet known on your planet." The being proceeded to heal Migueres of injuries to his 
          spine and more. Migueres was rushed to the hospital where he had three near-death 
          experiences, but ultimately recovered. He began having regular onboard experiences and 
          discovered that he had been given "the gift of healing," and found himself in telepathic 
          contact with ETs.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: CONNIE ISELE OF DIVIDE, CO</b>. began having unusual experiences from 
          a very young age. In  <b>1989</b>, she woke up to see strange praying mantis-like 
          creatures. Initially terrified, Isele soon realized that the ETs were actually there to 
          help. In <b>1989</b>, the ETs visited her and healed her of uterine cramping. Three 
          years later, they returned and healed her of arthritis in her knee. Three years after 
          that, in <b>1995</b>, Isele suffered a near-fatal auto accident. Doctors feared she 
          would lose her leg. Isele prayed to the ETs for help, and to her amazement, they 
          visited her in her hospital room and healed her. The doctors were shocked and gave 
          Isele the nickname "miracle legs."</p>

          <p><b>CASE FOUR</b>: After learning that Pine Bush in upstate NY was a huge UFO hotspot, 
          researcher Ellen Crystall traveled to the area and began not only seeing UFOs, but 
          photographing them. Before long, she saw an actual ET. Her sightings were so numerous, 
          she wondered if she might actually be a UFO contactee herself. Ellen learned that as a 
          child, she had been very sick with an undiagnosed intestinal disorder. She became so 
          sick, doctors feared she would die. But one day, she was miraculously healed. Later, 
          she learned in an unusual way that she had actually been healed by ETs.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FIVE</b>: Jerry Wills of KY was only twelve years old when he began seeing 
          UFOs and having contact with human-looking ETs who taught him a variety of scientific 
          and spiritual subjects. Around that time, he became bedridden with a dangerously high 
          fever. As he lay in bed, he was suddenly visited by grays who took him onboard a craft 
          and healed him. As an adult, Wills found that he had developed incredible healing 
          abilities.</p>

          <p><b>CASE SIX: IVAN MORALES</b>. A police officer from Puerto Rico, in <b>1980</b> 
          Morales found himself very sick with rheumatic fever. After praying for help, Morales 
          was shocked to be visited by two gray ETs who took him onboard a craft and to an 
          undersea base where they healed him, then returned him to his home.</p>

          <p><b>CASE SEVEN</b>: In <b>1998</b>, four-year-old Gabriel Flores of Chile was near 
          death from a severe case of rheumatic fever. While being driven to and from the 
          hospital, he had a UFO encounter which left him completely healed. Flores' healing 
          was confirmed by doctors, and soon the whole family began to experience incredible 
          events which left them convinced that they were all in contact with ETs.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">When it comes to UFOs, one of the most common assumptions 
          is that ETs would land on the White House lawn and say, “Take me to your leader!” 
          Ignoring the fact that UFOs have hovered over the White House at least twice, the 
          truth is they have shown themselves to a wide variety of world leaders. Most people 
          are probably unaware that presidents have seen UFOs, as have senators, representatives, 
          governors and many other leaders across the United States and the world.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents more than twenty world leaders who have had close encounters with 
          UFOs and extraterrestrials, reaching back to <b>1947</b>, the Modern Age of UFOs all the 
          way to the present day.</p>

          <p>The United States has produced more than a dozen such cases.</p>

          <p><b>Aug 1, 1947</b>: Mayor Potter P. Howard of Boise, Idaho is on a United Airlines 
          flight when he sees a flight of a dozen discs sweep below the jet.</p>

          <p><b>Apr 25, 1966</b>: Governor Haydon Burns of Florida is flying over Orlando 
          when everyone onboard the plane sees two glowing objects follow them.</p>

          <p><b>Jan 6, 1969</b>: Jimmy Carter, soon-to-be Governor and then President reports 
          his sighting of a multi-colored object hovering at low elevation.</p>

          <p><b>Sep 6, 1971</b>: Congressman Malcolm Wallop (soon to be Senator) of Wyoming 
          observes a fleet of a dozen objects leapfrogging in the sky.</p>

          <p><b>Oct 1973</b>: Governor John Gilligan of Ohio and his wife observe an amber-colored 
          object which sends down a bright beam of light.</p>

          <p><b>1974</b>: Governor Ronald Reagan of California is flying over Bakersfield when he 
          and the flight crew chase a UFO for several minutes.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 5, 1977</b>: an unnamed Senator of North Dakota (and his wife) are chased in 
          their car by two low-flying UFOs.</p>

          <p><b>1982</b>: Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio sees a UFO while staying at the 
          home of actress Shirley Maclaine in Graham, Washington.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 13, 1997</b>: Governor Fife Symington of Arizona is one of thousands of 
          people who witness the massive Phoenix Lights display.</p>

          <p>UFOs are a global phenomenon. So, it should come as no surprise that leaders all 
          across the world are also seeing UFOs. What follows are a dozen more examples of 
          extraordinary UFO encounters from world leaders across our planet.</p>

          <p><b>Jul 9, 1952</b>: Mayor Oscar Linke of Gleimershausen, Germany (and his daughter) 
          come upon a landed UFO and occupants in the forest.</p>

          seven minutes, then descend onto the surface of Lake Victoria.</p>

          <p><b>1974</b>: President Luis Echeverria of Mexico observes a gigantic UFO over the 
          town of Cuernavaca. Other witnesses include Mayor Valentin Lopez Gonzalez of Cuernavaca 
          and Governor Emilio Riva Palacio of Morelos.</p>

          <p><b>Mar 1974</b>: Mayor Petit of Rimogne, France sees a shiny, orange, oval disc hover 
          overhead for ten minutes, then move off.</p>

          <p><b>1975</b>: Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy of Grenada sees a UFO, and is also 
          involved in an apparent UFO/crash retrieval of a tall six-fingered ET.</p>

          <p><b>1979</b>: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil (and Brazilian Amabassador 
          Celso Furtado) see a glowing object hover over the sea.</p>

          <p><b>Sep 18, 1997</b>: President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of the Republic of Kalmykia is taken 
          onboard an ET craft to another planet and then returned.</p>

          <p>These accounts from world leaders across the U.S. and the world are likely just a 
          small sample of the actual number of cases. Most leaders who have encounters like 
          these are likely keeping them secret. The time for truth and transparency on this 
          subject is now! UFOs are clearly intentionally showing themselves to world leaders. 
          It's time that our leaders start telling the truth about UFOs.</p>

          THE ET<br>
          FERTILIZER<br>
          CONNECTION</a></h2>

          <h5>Nov 4, 2022 (0:43:16)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On <b>September 19, 1961</b>, a momentous event occurred 
          which generated headlines across the world and forever changed the way humanity 
          viewed the UFO phenomenon. While driving through the remote White Mountains of New 
          Hampshire, a married couple by the name of Barney and Betty Hill encountered a UFO. 
          The object descended low enough that Barney was able to see occupants looking down 
          at him from the craft. As they sped away, the craft pursued them. The couple 
          experienced about two hours of missing time, then returned to their home.</p>

          <p>This incredible case introduced the world to the idea of UFO abductions. And before 
          long, hundreds and then thousands of similar cases started pouring in from all over the 
          world. The case is perhaps the most famous in UFO history. But what many people don’t 
          know about is the fertilizer connection.</p>

          <p>During their encounter, the Hills had a bag of fertilizer stored in their trunk. And 
          when researchers began to look into their case, they asked the Hills if they had any 
          nitrates of any kind in the vehicle when they were taken onboard. The investigators 
          told them that they had researched other cases where there was a connection. The Hills 
          were initially puzzled by the question, and they didn't understand what the researchers 
          were getting at. Only then did they realize that yes, they did in fact have a bag of 
          fertilizer in their car. Was there a connection?</p>

          <p>The answer might be, yes! On <b>April 24, 1964</b>, dairy farmer, Gary T. Wilcox 
          encountered a landed UFO and occupants on his farm in Newark Valley, outside of Tioga 
          City, New York. He held a nearly two-hours-long conversation with the beings, during 
          which the ETs explained that they were interested in studying agriculture and the use 
          of fertilizer in his fields. They actually asked him for a bag of fertilizer, which 
          Wilcox provided. The case drew the attention of UFO researchers. It's a strange case, 
          but Wilcox's family and friends vouched for his honesty and integrity.</p>

          <p>In this video, we explore these two cases and several others which point towards the 
          ETs' interest in fertilizer. For example, there is the bizarre case of Mexican farmer, 
          Jose Carmen Garcia, who became internationally famous for his ability to grow super-sized 
          produce and vegetables. He grew ten-pound onions, sixty-pound cabbages and collard greens 
          more than five feet long. Scientists and agricultural experts were amazed. When they 
          asked what his secret was, Garcia shocked them by revealing that he had been given a 
          "secret formula" from extraterrestrials. As strange as this sounded, people had no choice 
          but to believe him, because Garcia was able to provide the gargantuan vegetables as proof.</p>

          <p>More cases exist, such as an anonymous gentleman who reported his sighting of a UFO 
          moving over the Agrium Fertilizer Plant in Borger, Texas in <b>1988</b>.</p>

          <p>Another case is that of a young girl from Winsted, Connecticut who woke up one evening 
          to watch a UFO land outside her home and disgorge several short humanoids who proceeded 
          to investigate the building across the street. It turned out that this building was 
          being used to store large amounts of fertilizer.</p>

          <p>There's also the case of an anonymous gentleman from Lee's Summit, Missouri who, after 
          having several sightings in the area, decided to investigate. He discovered that the 
          sightings seemed to be correlated to the use of fertilizer. Says the witness, "“One of 
          the commonalities is that they appear in areas which are rich in phosphorus such as 
          certain coast water, and other waterways which have runoff from fertilizer."</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the many cases pointing toward a strange ET-fertilizer 
          connection. This is an area of UFO contact that has never been explored in depth, 
          and provides some interesting insights into the behavior of UFOs and their occupants.</p>

          <h5>Oct 28, 2022 (1:07:18)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>January of 1973</b>, a fourteen-year-old girl named Dolly 
          Safran woke up to the fact that she was having regular visitations with extraterrestrials. 
          Prior to this, she had ignored, denied or explained away her encounters. But now, after a 
          profound onboard UFO experience, she knew the truth. She was a UFO contactee. She was having 
          regular visits with extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p>This began her lifelong relationship with ETs, during which she was taken onboard and 
          taught many subjects, including biology, astronomy, chemistry, morality, ethics, spirituality 
          and much more. Given the opportunity to work directly with them, Dolly chose to focus on 
          learning how to fly the craft.</p>

          <p>Dolly was visited more than a hundred times each year, and she began having mind-boggling 
          adventures with the ETs. Among the most startling and amazing, was being taken beyond our 
          solar system to visit other worlds.</p>

          <p>In Part One of these interviews, Dolly shared her childhood experiences up to age fourteen. 
          In Part Two: Dolly presented the incredible photographic evidence she was able to obtain. In 
          Part Three, she talked about the many different kinds of ETs she has visited. Now, in Part 
          Four of this ongoing series of interviews, Dolly Safran shares her incredible ventures of 
          travelling to other worlds.</p>

          <p>Dolly has had the wonderful opportunity to visit many of the worlds within our own solar 
          system, but even more astonishing are her visits to many planets orbiting other suns. One 
          such visit involved a trip to a small rocky world that was nearing the end of its life-cycle. 
          Dolly was taken there with several other contactees and was shown firsthand how every world 
          goes through various evolutionary stages, finally resulting in the death of that planet.</p>

          <p>On several occasions, Dolly was taken to a massive water planet whose surface was almost 
          entirely oceans, but was dotted with countless small islands. It was a planet filled with 
          life of all kinds, and there Dolly learned that there was a symmetry to life throughout the 
          universe, and that the flora and fauna on each planet followed a basic template. The planet 
          was also home to at least two intelligent species of humanoids. Dolly was able to meet them 
          both and even became good friends with a human-looking ET girl.</p>

          <p>More adventures followed. Over a period of many years, Dolly was taken repeatedly to a 
          planet that was being slowly consumed and destroyed by its own sun, which was in the process 
          of going nova. On the final visit, she was taken to see the world become torn apart and the 
          sun explode into a fantastic supernova.</p>

          <p>Dolly describes her visits to many other worlds, gas giants, water planets and more. Among 
          the most fantastic were her visits to massive alien Dyson Spheres, huge artificial planetoids 
          constructed by the ETs and used as waystations and outposts. Dolly was taken inside and shown 
          how the ETs preserve countless species of both plants and animals from across the universe.</p>

          <p>Dolly also shares how she was given the unique opportunity to visit the Voyager Space 
          Probes and get a close-up view of these human-made spacecraft traveling far beyond Earth.</p>

          <p>Finally, Dolly shares how she was given a front-row view to one of the most historic and 
          dramatic astronomical events in the history of our own solar system: the collision of Comet 
          Shoemaker-Levy with the planet Jupiter. While astronomers on Earth viewed the event through 
          telescopes, Dolly was taken onboard a UFO craft and saw the comet collision occur right 
          before her very eyes.</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the many events Dolly has experienced with the ETs. Her lifelong 
          experiences include many other adventures and explorations that have taken her to the farthest 
          reaches of the known universe. If you'd like to learn more about Dolly's experiences, her 
          account is told in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VF3J8NR/..." aria-label=

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs often behave in ways that can only be described as 
          bizarre. One type of behavior that is familiar to most UFO investigators are UFO-car 
          chases. In case after case, UFOs will approach a car driving down a remote highway 
          late at night and chase them down the road. But there’s another type of behavior 
          that goes far beyond just chasing a car. Sometimes UFOs will actually pull the car 
          off the road and suck it up into the sky! These are known as “car-lift” cases.</p>

          <p>For some reason, the UFO occupants just pull the car up, float it around and then 
          set it back down, leaving the people in the car bewildered and more than a little 
          frightened. The question is, why? The best way to get some answers is to examine the 
          cases. This video present more than twenty UFO car-lift cases, reaching back more 
          than sixty years up to the present day, and coming from all across our planet.</p>

          <p><b>1959</b>: four teenagers are driving outside of Goldfield, NV when their truck

          <p>As can be seen, there is no shortage of UFO car-lift cases. All over the world, 
          ETs are chasing cars down the highway and pulling them up into the sky. Some of 
          these cases result in missing time or an onboard experience. But many seem to be 
          more of a display, or a way for the ETs to announce their presence in an absolutely 
          undeniable way.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A ghost encounter can elicit a wide variety of emotions. 
          They can be funny, sad, scary, awe-inspiring...and some can be downright creepy! This 
          video presents three really creepy ghost stories, the kind that sends little icy 
          shivers down your spine.</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE: THE GHOST THAT CAME TO BED</b>. Shortly after moving into their new 
          home in Merced, California, Sally Sanders (pseudonym) began to experience weird 
          activity. Her husband never noticed anything strange, not at first. But Sally did. 
          Late one evening, she woke up to feel someone climbing into her bed. But when she 
          looked, nobody was there! She first thought it might have been her imagination, and 
          that it would never happen again. But it did. A few weeks later, she again woke up 
          to feel the mattress press down and the bedsheets rustle. But when she looked, nobody 
          was there. As she always did when this happened, she fled the bedroom and slept 
          elsewhere in the house.</p>

          <p>It happened again and again, and Sally grew increasingly concerned. She knew that 
          she had to take action. She decided to try an experiment. Knowing that the ghost 
          always crawled into bed in the same spot, she moved the bed. This, she hoped, would 
          stop the weird events from happening. Instead, it caused the haunting to escalate. 
          It wasn't long after that when Sally not only felt the ghost crawl into bed with her, 
          but this time it physically touched her!</p>

          <p>Sally and her husband decided to move. But the ghost wasn't done with them yet. 
          About two weeks before they moved away, the ghost attacked, crushing and trying to 
          suffocate Sally as she lay in bed. It was the single most terrifying experience of 
          her life.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: A VISION OF BLOOD</b>. In the <b>1980s</b>, Dorothy Hudson worked in 
          a business office in Los Angeles. One of Dorothy's co-workers was Margery, (pseudonym), 
          a bill-collector. Dorothy and Margery did not get along. One day the two of them got 
          into a disagreement. The next morning, Margery was supposed to go pick up a debtor's 
          check in Van Nuys, and come back to the office afterward. But Margery never showed up 
          at the office.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, Dorothy was at the office and went to visit the restroom. Walking inside, 
          she was shocked to see that the clean white tiles of the bathroom were dripping with 
          blood. It was all over the walls and floors. Blood was everywhere. Dorothy blinked it 
          shock. And when she looked again, it was gone.</p>

          <p>A short time later, Dorothy answered the office phone. It was Margery's husband 
          asking for Margery. Dorothy explained that his wife was supposed to pick up a check, 
          but that she had failed to return to the office. "Oh, my God, no!" Margery's husband 
          cried.</p>

          <p>"What's wrong?" Dorothy asked. Margery's husband explained that he wasn't sure, but 
          he had just received a call from the police, and he hung up the phone. A few hours later 
          he called back with devastating news. Margery had been killed. She had been run over by 
          a truck after picking up the check. Dorothy's boss visited the accident location and 
          learned that Margery's body had been crushed under the wheels of the truck, and that 
          blood was all over her car, the street and the sidewalk. The time of the accident was 
          about the same time Dorothy had seen the vision of blood in the bathroom. Somehow, 
          Dorothy had picked up on the terrible tragedy. It was an experience that sent chills 
          down her spine and left her pale and shaken.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: A BROTHER'S GHOST</b>. In the <b>early 1970s</b>, Tom and his older 
          brother Jeffrey (pseudonyms) lived in a modest home with their parents in Los Angeles, 
          California. The two of them were very close. Jeffrey had recently fallen in love with 
          a woman and was about to get married. Then tragedy struck. Jeffrey was in a tragic car 
          accident and died of his injuries at the scene. The entire family was devastated, but 
          Tom was perhaps the most affected.</p>

          <p>He spiraled into a deep depression. The senseless death of his older brother, whom he 
          loved and idolized, was an event which left him with a crushing sadness. He just couldn't 
          understand why his brother had been taken from him. Life no longer seemed worth living.</p>

          <p>Then one day, Tom ventured into his brother's room, sat on the bed, and began to play 
          some of Jeffrey's rock music. Jeffrey loved to sit in his hanging chair and listen to rock 
          music. A favorite song of his was "Comfortably Numb," by Pink Floyd. Tom decided to play 
          that song and reminisce about the all the good times he had with Jeffrey. That's when it 
          happened: the hanging chair began to swing back and forth by itself! Tom soon learned that 
          he could call on his brother's spirit anytime he wanted.</p>

          <p>These three cases show how ghosts can manifest in a wide variety of ways. If you'd

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs come in a dazzling array of shapes and sizes. Saucer-
          shaped craft, egg-shaped, spherical-shaped, teardrops, triangles, cigars...you name 
          it! The true number of cases is far larger than most people realize. UFOs are seen all 
          over the world by all kinds of people.</p>

          <p>This video presents a decade of sightings, stretching from <b>1947 to 1957</b>, 
          all involving firsthand witnesses who provide sketches of what they saw. It has been 
          said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And this is especially true when it 
          comes to UFOs. Sometimes the UFO craft are so strange, unusual and unique, that people 
          are unable to find the words to describe them. A simple sketch is not only helpful in 
          describing a UFO, it is often essential. A drawing is able to convey information in a 
          way that words simply cannot do.</p>

          <p>Fifty cases with eyewitness drawings, each providing another piece of the puzzle, 
          and each offering new insights into the nature and origin of UFOs. These cases show 
          that the UFO phenomenon is global and ongoing. They also show how our own governments 
          have attempted to cover-up UFO information, offering debunking explanations to 
          encounters that they know are absolutely genuine. They show how the Air Force's 
          Project Blue Book was not a true investigative body, but was instead an attempt 
          to deny the truth about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.</p>

          <h5>Sep 30, 2022  #1140 (0:28:05)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Did you know that children comprise a significant number of 
          UFO witnesses? There are many reasons for this. One is that children are usually outside 
          more than adults. Also, children are more likely to report their encounters than are 
          adults. A third reason is that UFO contact often begins early in childhood. As evidenced 
          by the many cases of schoolyard UFO encounters, ETs like to show themselves to children.
          Unfortunately, children are often disbelieved or not taken seriously. Therefore, it's 
          likely that the actual numbers of kids contact UFOs is higher than most people think.</p>

          <p>This video presents three incredible cases of kids who have had UFO encounters. Each 
          of these cases involves multiple witnesses and various forms of evidence such as 
          electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects and landing traces. 
          Under the J. Allen Hynek system, these would be classified as Close Encounters of the 
          Second and Third Kind. In other words, these are not simple sightings, but very close 
          encounters in which the environment is affected in some way, and/or involve humanoids.</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE: THE CASA BLANCA ENCOUNTER</b>. On the <b>afternoon of August 22, 1955</b>, 
          a group of eight children were playing outside their homes in the Casa Blanca area of 
          Riverside, California. Looking up, the children saw a silver spinning disc swooping down 
          from above. As the children watched, the object disappeared and reappeared several times. 
          Suddenly there were multiple objects of different shapes and sizes, some emitting a strange 
          musical pinging sound. Without warning, one of the objects (described as the size of three 
          homes) landed in a nearby field.</p>

          <p>A strange-looking humanoid being stepped out and began beckoning at the kids to go 
          onboard.  For the next hour or two, pandemonium ensued as the children interacted with 
          the UFOs and the strange being. Some of the children came very close to going onboard, 
          but were held back by their friends. Strangely, two adults were present for at least 
          part of the encounter, but could not see anything! Reporters and UFO researchers 
          converged to investigate the case. There was no evidence of a hoax, and the case remains 
          unexplained to this day.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: KIDS BUZZED BY A UFO</b>. On the <b>evening of February 24, 1959</b>, a 
          young high school student was babysitting his little brother in their home in Victorville, 
          California. Without warning, a weird buzzing sound filled the air, and the house began to 
          vibrate. The radio in the house became filled with static and the dogs outside started to 
          bark furiously. Running outside, the witness was amazed to see a large UFO craft swoop down 
          directly over his house at a height of only ten feet. Moments later, the UFO returned, 
          swooping down again, coming even lower.</p>

          <p>Terrified, the witness ran inside to grab his gun and protect his home. For the next few 
          minutes, the UFO swooped down over their home at least five times before finally accelerating 
          off into the distance. The boys' parents arrived home to find their children hiding inside, 
          and their two dogs shaking and cowering in fear. They contacted authorities to report the 
          incident. Air Force intelligence officers from Project Blue Book arrived, and after 
          interviewing the witnesses, declared the case genuine. They discovered that the neighbors 
          experienced unexplained static on their TV sets. Unable to explain the case, Project Blue 
          Book labeled the case unidentified: Case #1140.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: THE LEMON GROVE UFO LANDING</b>. On <b>November 6, 1973</b>, Richard 
          T. and Daniel F (age eleven) were exploring the fields near their homes in Lemon Grove, 
          California. To their amazement, they came upon a strange object landed in the field. It 
          was metallic, saucer-shaped with a dome on top and covered with colored lights. 
          Wondering what it might be, they walked right up to it and knocked on the side with 
          their flashlight. The object immediately lit up and began to rotate and rise upward. 
          Terrified, the kids turned and ran, but found that they were moving in slow motion.</p> 

          <p>They watched the craft accelerate upwards and disappear into the clouds. Running 
          home, they told their parents what happened. Investigators were called in who, upon 
          examining the site, found strange landing traces. The hard-packed clay ground had 
          strange holes in it, and the grass beneath the craft was swirled. Investigators then 
          learned that several neighbors reported strange interference on their televisions and 
          radios. Also, the phone lines in the area were fused together and had to be replaced.</p>

          <p>These three California cases show that a close encounter with an extraterrestrial 
          can happen without warning, when you least expect it. If you would like to learn more

          HEALING</a></h2>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Healings are a consistent feature of UFO encounters, and 
          they are more common than most people realize. Cases reach back more than 100 years 
          and come from across the world. They cover a wide variety of injuries, illnesses and 
          diseases. Most major UFO researchers have multiple cases. This video presents five 
          true cases of people who have been healed by extraterrestrials.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE ONE: DIPHTHERIA</b>. From researcher David Jacobs, Ph.D., in <b>1962</b>, 
          Alice Haggerty of Trenton, New Jersey was struck with the sometimes fatal disease 
          diphtheria. For religious reasons, her parents had not inoculated her against the 
          disease. When her condition worsened, they called in a doctor who cared for her as 
          best as he could. Unfortunately, Alice's condition deteriorated. Alice became so 
          sick that she was not expected to live through the night. On that evening, Alice 
          was visited by ETs, taken onboard and healed. The next morning, she was fully 
          recovered, amazing both her parents and the doctor.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: HERNIA</b>. In <b>2000</b>, Jim Law from Gainesville, Florida developed 
          an inguinal hernia. After being diagnosed by a specialist, Jim elected to have surgery. 
          However, before the surgery, he was visited by three gray ETs. Jim asked the grays to 
          heal him, and to his surprise, they said, “We know of the condition you have a concern 
          about and will help you.” Which they did! Jim then asked them why they had contacted 
          him, and the grays said, "We are interested in you because you have the genetic 
          potential to live a long time.” Jim was fascinated because longevity was in his 
          family. At the time, his grandfather was 106 years old, and his aunt and great 
          grandmother both lived to 109.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: SEPARATED ACHILLES TENDON</b>. In <b>2005</b>, Michael Thomas Knox 
          (a former Air Force officer) attended the MUFON UFO conference in Irvine, California. 
          At the time, he had been diagnosed with a separated Achilles tendon. Doctors told him 
          that he required surgery to repair his condition. However, while staying at the 
          conference, Knox was visited in his hotel room by three grays who performed surgery 
          on him. Knox had no memory of this, but his roommate saw it all. She reported that 
          they were both taken onboard a craft as were several other people at the conference. 
          They received further confirmation of the event the next morning when they discovered 
          strange bruises and marks, and also unexplained fluorescent stains in their hotel 
          room. Also, another group of witnesses reported seeing a UFO hovering directly over 
          the hotel that evening!</p>

          <p><b>CASE FOUR: BODY INJURIES</b>. In <b>1960</b>, electrical engineer, Vlado Victor 
          Kapetanovic was hunting in the Callejon de Hauylas region of rural Peru. Traveling 
          with a guide, they both had multiple sightings of strange metallic discs zipping 
          through the sky. They came upon a remote village of native Peruvians and discovered 
          that a young boy had recently fallen off a cliff and was suffering from severe injuries 
          which had left him comatose and on the edge of death. Victor offered to transport the 
          boy to a hospital many miles away. The parents refused, saying that the "sky gods" 
          would come and heal the boy. Victor's guide explained that the people of the village 
          were regularly visited by ETs who took care of them. And sure enough, a short time 
          later, a UFO landed, and a beautiful human-looking figure exited the craft. She 
          scooped up the boy and took him inside the craft. Shortly later, the boy came out 
          perfectly healed. Victor verified the healing and then spoke with the ET woman. She 
          invited him onboard the craft. This began a series of contacts with the ETs which 
          altered the course of Victor's life.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FIVE</b>: In <b>1971</b>, Gilbert Camus, a radio engineer from Gevingey, 
          France was driving along the highway near the village of Trenal when he encountered 
          a landed UFO and more than 20 strange-looking figures. Gilbert was then struck by a 
          beam of light which took control of his car, slowing its speed to a crawl. A short 
          time later, the beam retracted, and Gilbert continued on his way. Arriving home, 
          Gilbert found strange marks on his body and his underclothes. Returning to the site 
          of the encounter the next day, he found strange depressions and melted ice. Also, 
          the paint on his Peugeot began to fade. Most amazing, at the time of the encounter, 
          Gilbert was suffering from chronic liver disease. His condition was causing loss of 
          appetite and unbearably painful headaches. However, following the encounter, his 
          health problems disappeared. He had been healed!</p>

          <p>These five cases are just a tiny portion of the more than 300 healings on record. 
          One of the primary ET missions is the healing of humanity. If you would like to learn 
          more about these cases and others, check out my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A ghostly encounter is one of the most commonly reported 
          types of paranormal experiences. Ghosts can manifest in a wide variety of ways, 
          including opening and closing doors, moving objects, turning lights on and off, 
          phantom footsteps, cold-spots, unexplained odors, full-color apparitions and much 
          more. Sometimes a home or specific structure is haunted, but other times a haunting 
          can encompass a much larger area.</p>

          <p>This video presents two cases of large-scale hauntings, both involving numerous 
          firsthand witnesses encountering ghosts over a wide area with a large variety of 
          paranormal manifestations.</p>

          <p>The first case has come to be known as "The White Witch." This case takes place near 
          the Oakland/El Sobrante area of northern California. There are a few different versions 
          explaining the actual origins of the haunting, but most people report the same type of 
          manifestation: a ghostly apparition of a tall glowing lady who wanders the areas of 
          Alvarado Park, Tilden Park and Joaquin Miller Park. Although the case has become 
          something of a local urban legend, there are numerous reported accounts of people who 
          claim to have seen the apparition.</p>

          <p>One group of witnesses involves five young men who had a hostile encounter with the 
          White Witch in <b>1990</b>. It was an encounter that left them badly frightened and 
          convinced them forever that the White Witch is very real indeed.</p>

          <p>The second case in this video is "The Ghosts of the Indian Burial Ground." This case 
          takes in place Topanga Canyon, located in the Santa Monica Mountains adjacent to Los 
          Angeles, California. The center of the haunting is at the entrance of Topanga State 
          Park, the former location of a Chumash Native American settlement and alleged burial 
          ground. The haunting has affected at least six separate homes and a part of the Trippet 
          Ranch/Topanga State Park. The haunting activity reaches back several decades and is 
          still going on today. The activity includes strange noises, moving objects, ghostly 
          footsteps, weird presences, apparitions and more. The haunting is very well-known 
          among the local residents, most who have remained quiet about what is going on.</p>

          <p>These two locations are good examples of on-going active hauntings, and if anyone 
          wants to experience a ghost, both locations are open to the public. To explore more 
          about these hauntings and many others, check out my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Dolly Safran, a nurse and Army D.O.D employee from Florida, 
          has experienced a lifetime of UFO contact. While her experiences were initially shrouded 
          in missing time, at age fourteen she experienced an encounter that would change her life 
          forever. From that point on, Dolly remembered her UFO contacts fully consciously. She 
          has since had thousands of contacts and experienced a wide variety of encounters.</p>

          <p>In Part One of this series, we explored Dolly's encounters up to age fourteen. In 
          Part Two, we presented the many UFO photographs and films Dolly was able to capture. 
          Now, in Part Three, we now explore the many different types of extraterrestrials 
          Dolly has encountered.</p>

          <p>Among the most common type of ETs Dolly has encountered are the A.I. grays. These are 
          small three-foot-tall biological android-like beings who function as workers. They assist 
          in the transportation of humans to and from the ET craft and carry out many other duties. 
          They are not living beings with souls, but they can function autonomously. They can also 
          be used by the ETs as avatars.</p>

          <p>Dolly has also encountered tall grays, mid-sized grays and small grays. These are 
          biological beings, with genetics. They eat, sleep and have all the biological functions 
          of human beings. Dolly's main ET liason is a tall gray she calls "Momma." Dolly met 
          Momma when she was only six years old and is still in contact with her today.</p>

          <p>Many contactees describe small blue troll-like beings about three-feet in height. 
          Dolly has met these as well, and says that they are a variation of the commonly 
          described grays. They often work with young children and help to reduce the fear 
          factor often associated with UFO contact.</p>
          
          <p>On one occasion, Dolly had the rare opportunity to see two dog-like ETs, very 
          similar in description to the Egyptian figure known as Anubis. These beings were 
          more than six feet tall, broad-shouldered, muscular and covered with fur.</p>

          <p>On another rare occasion, Dolly was able to visit with cat-like ETs. Described 
          very much as humanoid cats, these beings are short, covered with fur and quite 
          solitary. Dolly had only a brief encounter with them, but it was quite close-up, 
          and left a deep impression on her.</p>

          <p>Periodically during her onboard UFO encounters, Dolly has interacted with the beings 
          known as Tall Whites. These ETs are very stern and serious. They are tall and can reach 
          well over ten or fifteen feet in height. They have only limited contact with humans and 
          usually keep to themselves.</p>

          <p>Dolly has had many interactions with human-looking ETs, often described as Nordics. 
          These beings are very much like us, and have the same variations we have on our own 
          planet. On several occasions, Dolly has interacted with Misha, a young girl from 
          another planet. Misha, says Dolly, looks very much like the people from the indigenous 
          population of Polynesia.</p>

          <p>Dolly has also encountered humanoid beings who spend much of their time in the water. 
          They have webbed hands and feet and are able to remain underwater for long periods of 
          time.</p>

          <p>On a few occasions, Dolly has been taken to see third-dimensional light beings who 
          are able to transcend the physical world and travel into the higher dimensions. These 
          are very powerful beings with very strong paranormal abilities.</p>

          <p>Another amazing encounter Dolly experienced was with a nine-foot-tall praying mantis 
          being. This encounter occurred in the backyard of a rural farm in Georgia. The being 
          told Dolly that they are the Watchers and that they came to check on her following a 
          very delicate medical procedure that she had undergone days earlier.</p>

          <p>Among the most fantastic beings Dolly has encountered are the so-called Anunnaki. 
          These winged beings are very tall, strong and powerful. Dolly only met them once when 
          she was a little girl, but the encounter was one she will never forget.</p>

          <p>Dolly's case is one of the most extensive accounts of UFO contact on record. She 
          has spent days and weeks at a time among the ETs and has learned vast amounts of 
          knowledge from them. The ETs, Dolly says, are very much like us. Her experiences 
          have taught her that there is life throughout the universe, and that we are only a 
          small part of a vast network of living beings that exist among the billions of stars 
          in the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While seeing a UFO is undeniably interesting, far more 
          compelling are cases of UFO landings. In these cases, the extraterrestrial craft are 
          observed from a short distance, virtually removing any chance of misperception. This 
          video presents seven cases from across the United States involving dramatic UFO 
          landings.</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE: UFO LANDING AT ELY</b>. On <b>June 25, 1964</b>, two brothers were 
          driving from Spring Valley to the town of Ely, Nevada. At some point during the trip, 
          they came upon an object landed directly in the center of the road. George stopped 
          the car and attempted to walk up to the object, causing a surprising reaction from 
          the UFO occupants.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: THE UFO HOUSE</b>. One <b>evening in December 2012</b>, an anonymous 
          couple from Sierra Vista, Arizona stepped outside their home to do some stargazing. 
          Looking at a fenced-in field next to their home, they were amazed to see what appeared 
          to be a small strange-looking structure with only a few windows. It was odd because it 
          hadn't been there earlier in the day. How had it appeared? Puzzled, they didn't think 
          much of it until morning arrived, and they saw something they couldn't understand.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: LANDING IN LUKACHUKAI</b>: One <b>evening in mid-August 1982</b>, three 
          men were driving to the Lukachukai Rodeo in Arizona when they saw a start-like object 
          swoop towards them from above. Later on during the drive, they saw that the object had 
          apparently landed in a ravine alongside the road. They exited the car andobserved the 
          object. But as they drove to their location, they were soon to learn that they were not 
          the only witnesses.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FOUR: UFO LANDING IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY</b>. In <b>mid-June of 1955</b>, 
          Ted Kittredge was drawn outside his home by the sound of his dogs barking. To his 
          amazement, he saw that a gigantic gold-colored sphere had landed in his front yard. Even 
          more incredible, standing next to it were three seven-foot-tall human-looking ETs who had 
          a message they wanted to share.   Todd was even more amazed when he learned that numerous 
          other people in the area reported the same type of encounter.</p>

          <p><b>CASE FIVE: THE OLD WISE ONES</b>. Growing up on a 3000-acre ranch about fifty miles 
          west of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Michael (pseudonym) experienced a series of UFO 
          encounters, culminating in a UFO encounter during which he met a group of seven-foot-tall 
          beings. Michael described them as "very gentle and loving" and says that they give him an 
          important message and warning for all humanity.</p>

          <p><b>CASE SIX: UFO LANDING AT LAS CRUCES</b>. In the <b>summer of 1952</b>, Hilda McAfee 
          and her mother were traveling along Highway 10 from Las Cruces to their home in Deming, 
          New Mexico. Suddenly they saw a blinding blue light ahead of them in the road. Slowing 
          down, they saw a large object landed in the road, and next to it stood two strange-
          looking humanoids. It was an encounter that would leave them both shaken, not only 
          mentally, but physically.</p>

          <p><b>CASE SEVEN: UFO LANDING IN CONKLIN</b>. On <b>July 16, 1964</b>, Mrs. Travis was 
          in her home in Conklin, New York, when her two sons, Edmund (age nine) and Randy (age 
          seven), and their three friends announced that they had seen a spaceman, and needed to 
          bring him a jar of water. When questioned about this, the children said a silvery 
          object had landed in the field, and a short humanoid approached them. Questioned 
          separately by the adults, the children stuck to their story.</p>

          <p>These seven cases are just a few of the many, many UFO landing cases on record. If

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Jesus walking on water in the Sea of Galilee is a very well-
          known miraculous event. And of course, there is the account of Buddha performing the 
          same wondrous talent. Although these men both lived thousands of years ago, their 
          incredible feats are still remembered today. But what many people don't realize is that 
          there are dozens of cases from many different cultures throughout history in which 
          people have walked on water. Some of these accounts were widely viewed by outside 
          witnesses and are surprisingly well-verified.</p>

          <p>For example, in the <b>year 350</b>, St. Ammon of Egypt was viewed by his disciple to 
          float over a river.</p>

          <p>In the <b>4th century</b>, Saint Bessarion reportedly walked across the Nile, the Takazze 
          River and the Barada River.</p>

          <p>Another early case is Raymond of Pennafort, confessor to King James I of Aragon. Raymond 
          was seen by hundreds of spectators to travel from the Island of Mayorca to Barcelona, a 
          distance of 160 miles, using only his cloak as a flotation device. Many sailors observed this 
          event, and Raymond's arrival on the shore was observed by a crowd of hundreds.</p>

          <p>Many of the early cases involve various saints. In the <b>6th century</b>, Maurus rescued 
          Saint Placid from drowning in a lake in Subiaco, Italy. Maurus ran across the surface 
          of the lake and retrieved Placid. Only upon returning to the shore did he realize that 
          he had actually walked on water.</p>

          <p>In <b>1430</b>, Blessed Alvarez of Cordova, Italy joined the list of people who have walked 
          on water when he was seen walking across a flooded river to reach his monastery.</p>

          <p>In the <b>early 1500s</b>, Saint Peter of Alcantara was observed to walk across the Guadiana 
          River in Spain.</p>

          <p>Aso in the <b>1500s</b>, Saint Seraphino was seen walking across the Potenza River in Italy.</p>

          <p>One of the most remarkable and widely viewed accounts of walking on water occurred in the 
          <b>1700s</b> to Saint Gerard of Majella, who was seen by a crowd of hundreds of people to 
          walk on water in order to rescue a small boat that was sinking off the coast of Italy.</p>

          <p>While many of the early cases involve saints, accounts come from all over the world from a 
          wide variety of people of different cultures.</p>

          <p>In the <b>1800s</b>, "Dengnabine," a well-known Azande Medicine Man from Africa was observed 
          to walk on water.</p>

          <p>Another famous case from the <b>1800s</b> is that of Mademoiselle Frederica Hauffe of France, 
          also known as the Seer of Provorst. She displayed numerous psychic abilities, among them one 
          instance of walking on water.

          <p>Two saints from Russia, Saint Basil <b>(1800s)</b> and Saint Zachary <b>(1900s)</b> were 
          both seen by witnesses to walk on water.</p>

          <p>An amusing and modern case occurred on <b>July 18, 1837</b> to an eight-year-old Russian boy 
          named Nikolai Yurlov. On that evening, Nikolai was woken up by a ghostly apparition. He 
          became so frightened that he fled his home in terror and actually ran across the surface 
          of the Sviyaga River. Servants who were chasing the boy were shocked to find Nikolai on 
          the other side of the river, completely dry.</p>

          <p>In <b>1894</b>, explorer and researcher Baird T. Spaulding traveled with a group of men to 
          study the miracles of Enlightened Masters from the Far East. While visiting India, they 
          met a group of Yogis who took them on a journey to the foothills of the Himalayas. 
          Spaulding and his companions observed a group of a dozen yogis traverse a large river 
          by walking on the surface of the water. The yogis explained that with the proper training, 
          anyone could learn to attain this ability.</p>

          <p>One of the most unusual cases of this kind comes from Angelo Faticoni of Jacksonville, 
          Florida. Also called "The Human Cork" and "The Man They Could Not Drown." Faticoni 
          repeatedly demonstrated his ability to stay afloat on the surface of the water for 
          hours at a time in virtually any position. He could stay on the surface lying on his 
          side, his back or curled up in a ball. He could even sleep on the water. He was able 
          to swim long distances. He subjected himself to numerous experiments including allowing 
          himself to be tied down with weights or sewn into a sac. Still he remained on the 
          surface of the water. Scientists from Harvard University studied his case and were 
          unable to explain Faticoni's amazing ability.</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the many cases of people who have displayed this unusual 
          ability to walk on water. French researcher Olivier Leroy lists many other saints 
          with this ability. Can humans walk on water? The answer is apparently yes!</p>

          <h5>Aug 19, 2022 (0:26:34)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO researchers have known for a very long time that UFOs 
          are attracted to military bases. In fact, pioneering investigators Jim and Coral Lorenzen 
          knew this, and when new military installations were built, they predicted sightings would 
          occur there. And they were right!</p>

          <p>The state of California has the largest population of any state, and according to NUFORC 
          (the National UFO Reporting Center,) it also produces more UFO reports than any other 
          states. California also has a very large number of highly advanced and sensitive military 
          bases. So, it should come as no surprise that many of these installations have been visited 
          by UFOs. In fact, sightings stretch all the way back to at least <b>1947</b>, The Modern 
          Age of UFOs, and are continuing today.</p>

          <p>This video presents about a dozen high profile cases of UFOs surveilling California 
          military bases. These are not random sightings of lights in the sky at night. Many of 
          these cases involve solid, metallic objects, and some are seen over a period of days. 
          Many bases have been repeatedly visited for years on end. A few of the cases involve 
          confirmed radar returns, and several of them were declared unidentified by intelligence 
          officers from the Air Force's Project Blue Book.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>July 3, 1947</b>, Santa Rosa Naval Auxiliary Station goes on high alert when a 
              20-foot metallic saucer hovers a mere 1000 feet above the base runway.</li>
            <li><b>July 29, 1947</b>, Hamilton Field experiences the first of a series of dramatic 
              encounters over the base occurring over a period of five years.</li>
            <li><b>March 3, 1951</b>, UFO activity at McClellan Air Force Base is so brazen that 
              Blue Book officers investigate and are forced to label the case Unknown.</li>
            <li><b>May 1952</b>, a month-long series of low-level daylight sightings of metallic 
              objects over George AFB causes alarm at high levels of government.</li>
            <li><b>July 24, 1952</b>, several military personnel at Travis Air Force base report 
              a UFO. Blue Book officers arrive, and again are unable to identify the objects.</li>
            <li><b>January 28, 1953</b>, control tower operators at El Toro Marine Base (and at 
              nearby bases) try to intercept a fiery red disc hovering over the base.</li>
            <li><b>November 3, 1953</b>, a witness identified only as "J" observes and photographs 
              a UFO hovering at low levels above Norton Air Force Base.</li>
            <li><b>February 2, 1955</b>, concerns are raised when numerous officers at Miramar 
              Naval Air Station see a UFO, and Blue Book has no idea what it is!</li>
            <li><b>1956</b>, a cat-and-mouse confrontation between UFOs and USAF jet fighters 
              occurs over Castle AFB. The pilots are ordered to remain silent.</li>
            <li><b>September 15, 1964</b>, an Atlas Missile is launched from Vandenberg AFB, 
              causing a UFO incident that will make waves for decades to come.</li>
            <li><b>December 16, 1966</b>, a crowd of military officers at San Diego Naval Air 
              Station observe multiple objects perform gymnastics over the base.</li>
            <li><b>February 8, 1990</b>, residents outside of Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Corps Air 
              Ground Combat Base observe and photograph an incredible encounter.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Edwards Air Force Base has a history of UFO 
          encounters that rival perhaps any other military base in the United States. Clearly 
          something profound is happening here. The reports coming from highly reputable trained 
          observers within our own military can be ignored no longer. The time for lies and cover-ups 
          is over. The truth must be revealed. These cases show that UFOs and extraterrestrials are 
          watching our technological progress very closely. They are letting our military know that 
          we are being watched.</p>

          <p>If you would like to explore more about UFO activity over California military bases, and

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Since recorded history, people of all cultures across the 
          world report seeing ghosts. They represent some of the best evidence we have for 
          existence after death. But what many people don't know is that there are different 
          kinds of ghosts.</p>

          <p>For example, a typical ghost is simply an earthbound soul, someone who has remain 
          attached to the Earthly plane. Ghosts remain earthbound for a variety of reasons. 
          They might not realize they have passed on. They might be attached to a place or a 
          person. They may suffer from confusion or addictions. Ghosts are responsible for the 
          many haunted places across our planet</p>

          <p>Then there are spirits. These are people who have passed on to the Other Side. They 
          are aware that they are deceased and are no longer attached to the Earthly planes. 
          Instead, they come to visit, usually with a purpose. They come to let their loved ones 
          know that they are fine, to guide people, or to dispense information.</p>

          <p>Then there are demons and poltergeists. Researchers are unsure about the origins of 
          these entities. Some believe they are the result of psychokinetic energy from an 
          emotionally disturbed person; others believe they are the result of uncontrolled 
          mediumship, and others believe they are inhuman malevolent spirits. They can range 
          from mischievous to downright evil.</p>

          <p>This video presents three true accounts, one involving a ghost, one involving a 
          spirit, and one involving a demon.</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE: THE GHOST WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE</b>. Sarah first became aware of the 
          ghost in her house when she heard an old man coughing. After several instances of this, 
          she told her sister and mother, neither who believed her. Soon more events occurred. 
          And then one day, Sarah not only heard coughing, she heard footsteps walk to the 
          bathroom, then the door opened and closed, the ghost spit in the toilet and flushed 
          it. Sarah ran screaming from the house. Still, neither her sister nor mother ever 
          heard anything. Years passed with only occasional activity. One day they moved out and 
          rented the house. Then one day the tenants called. They had experienced an event that 
          left them baffled. Somebody had answered the phone. The problem was, the wife was alone 
          in the house, and it wasn't her!</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: A HAND ACROSS DEATH</b>. One morning, Connie Lopez woke in her bedroom 
          to find a strange mystery. An oily handprint had been left on her shower. She kept 
          spotlessly clean house, so it didn't make any sense. Besides, the handprint was much 
          larger than her own. She complained to her landlord, but he had no answers. Then it 
          happened again! Connie woke one morning and discovered an oily handprint right on her 
          own hand. A further investigation revealed fresh oil spots around her bed, and also 
          around the dining room table. It was clear she had an intruder, but who?</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE: A DEMON NAMED BART</b>. Three young sisters and their friend decided 
          that they were going to contact deceased celebrities using a Ouija board. They had done 
          this several times before, but this time something different happened. The board began 
          to spell out threatening messages. The girls asked the board who was communicating, and 
          all it would say was that the spirit was in the house. And then they asked the spirit 
          its name. The spirit spelled out the name Bart and said he was a demon. Frightened, the 
          girls fled the house and decided to burn the Ouija board. But when one of them returned 
          inside to get some matches, she was confronted with a sight that sent icy chills down her 
          spine. It was a dark demonic spirit. And it wasn't going away anytime soon.</p>

          <p>These three cases reveal the complexity of ghostly encounters and show how many 
          different ways they are able to manifest. Ghost encounters can produce the entire 
          range of emotions. As these cases show, some can be puzzling, some can be comforting, 
          and some can be absolutely terrifying.</p>

          others, check out my book:

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">ETs are healing people all across the world. With more than 
          300 documented cases, it is clear that healing is a regular facet of a UFO encounter. 
          Most major researchers have multiple cases involving cures. These cases not only provide 
          good hard evidence of extraterrestrials, but they also show a benevolent side to UFO 
          encounters. But with a fear-based media and an active UFO cover-up, these kinds of cases 
          are not getting the attention they deserve.</p>

          <p>This video presents ten true cases of healings of one specific type: the kidneys. 
          These cases show how truly advanced in medicine the ETs are.</p>

          <p><b>December 1965</b>: Swedish construction worker</b> Richard Hoglund encounters a 
          landed UFO and human-looking occupants. After indicating that he has a problem with 
          kidney stones, the ETs agree to cure him.</p>

          <p>In <b>1965</b>, health-food distributor Ludwig F. Pallman meets a human-looking man 
          claiming to be an ET. Skeptical, Pallman is invited onboard a UFO in Peru. After being 
          hospitalized for kidney disease, the ETs arrive to help.</p>

          <p><b>October 25, 1974</b>, oil-field worker Carl Higdon. is out hunting elk in Rawlins, 
          Wyoming. Upon encountering a landed UFO, he is taken onboard and healed of two conditions: 
          tubercular scars in his lungs, and kidney stones.</p>

          <p><b>July 17, 1978</b>, Carmela is taken from her home in Cayey, Puerto Rico into an ET 
          craft. She sees different types of ETs, who issue dire warnings about the future of Earth, 
          and then heal her diseased kidneys.</p>

          <p>In <b>August of 1980</b>, Hector Vasquez of San Juan, Puerto Rico. is suffering from a 
          bad case of kidney stones. Luckily, his friend is a UFO contactee. And on the way to the 
          hospital, the ETs arrive on a healing mission.</p>

          <p>In <b>early 1985</b>, Veronica of Ontario, Canada. finds herself being escorted onto 
          a UFO which had landed in her alley. Doctors had diagnosed her with kidney disease and 
          told her she needed surgery. Then the aliens arrived!</p>

          <p>In the <b>summer of 1985</b>, an anonymous woman from British Columbia, Canada 
          meditates to relieve her severe kidney pain. Without warning, she finds herself onboard 
          a UFO with tall humanoids, and they want to help.</p>

          <p><b>April 2, 1991</b>, a peasant in Tenjo, Colombia. is riding his donkey to work 
          when a craft lands nearby. Next thing he knows, he's being pulled onboard and taken 
          to a large mothership where he is cured of kidney stones.</p>

          <p><b>January 26, 1997</b>, abductee Andrew from Texas. finds a gray alien in his 
          bedroom. After an exam, the gray asks him if the strange object in his kidneys is 
          supposed to be there? No, he says. The grays agree to help.</p>

          <p>In <b>July 2006</b>, Ms. E.A. Sabean. is diagnosed with chronic renal failure. She 
          prays for a healing and finds herself surrounded by short, brown-skinned ETs who heal 
          her. Later, the ETs warn her, stop drinking diet coke!</p>

          <p>These ten cases, most of which are verified by doctors, show that ETs do have an 
          agenda to heal people. These healing cases reach back nearly a hundred years and come 
          from all over the world. The cures cover the gamut of injuries, illnesses, conditions 
          and diseases. The kidney cures presented here are likely just the tip of the iceberg. 
          The evidence can no longer be denied. ETs are healing people. And with hundreds of more 
          cases like these, it's likely far more common than most people realize.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While UFO sightings are undeniably interesting, even more 
          fascinating are accounts of actual contact. Missing time, face-to-face contact with 
          ETs, onboard encounters -- these kinds of cases provide deep insights into what it's 
          like to have an extraterrestrial experience.</p>

          <p>This video presents five extraordinary cases of UFO contact. Each case is different 
          and shows just how truly strange, bizarre and enlightening it can be to have a close-up 
          encounter with beings from other worlds.</p>

          <h4>CASE ONE: I DID NOT EXIST FOR A DAY</h4>
          <p>In the <b>summer of 1973</b>, a wall street executive flew by 747 from Hawaii to his 
          home in New York City. During the flight, he was shocked to see a metallic saucer outside 
          the window, pacing the jet. At first, he thought it was just a simple sighting. It wasn't 
          until he got home and received a huge shock that he realized his encounter was far more 
          than just a sighting.</p>

          <h4>CASE TWO: THE ABDUCTION OF TOM MURILLO</h4>
          
          <p>One <b>evening in 1976</b>, New Mexico resident Tom Murillo took a drive to cool off 
          after a family quarrel. Parking alongside a remote country road, he was approached by a 
          strange tall figure. Moments later, he found himself being levitated inside a tube of 
          light into a UFO craft. Inside, he was undressed, placed on a table and examined by gray 
          ETs. But it's what they did next that left him stunned. And after being placed back in 
          his car, Tom realized that he had just undergone the most profound and unusual experience 
          of his life.</p>

          <h4>CASE THREE: MISSING TIME IN MOUNDHOUSE</h4>

          <p>One <b>night in April of 1996</b>, Paul (pseudonym), was driving to his home in 
          Dayton, Nevada. Just after passing through the small desert town of Moundhouse, he saw 
          a brilliant light ahead of him. Very quickly the light grew in size and landed alongside 
          the highway, revealing itself to be an enormous saucer-shaped craft. Two tiers of windows 
          lined the circumference. Looking through the windows, Paul saw more than a dozen strange 
          figures looking down at him. Some were grays, but some were much stranger beings. And 
          then they began to communicate with him, initiating an encounter that would alter the 
          path of his life forever.</p>

          <h4>CASE FOUR: CONTACT IN TONOPAH</h4>
          
          <p>On the evening of <b>July 21, 2009</b>, four friends (James, Henry, Heather and Jamie) 
          decided to go UFO hunting in the deserts outside of Tonopah, Arizona. They had heard of 
          recent sightings in the area and were hoping to have one themselves. Little did they 
          realize that they were about to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. 
          Without warning, a gigantic triangular-shaped craft hovered overhead and then landed in 
          front of them. A panel opened, and out stepped two strange humanoids, a short gray alien 
          and an eight-foot-tall being. The two ETs began to communicate telepathically with the 
          witnesses, giving them a dire warning to share with all humanity. James was able to 
          videotape the entire encounter. After the craft departed however, the military showed 
          up and surrounded their vehicle. Their lives, they knew, would never be the same.</p>

          <h4>CASE FIVE: IS GRANDPA AN ALIEN?</h4>

          <p>In <b>1955</b>, five-year-old Marty Minetto was spending time with his grandparents 
          in their home outside of Ault, Colorado. On April 9, Marty's grandfather approached him 
          and asked him if he'd like to go for a walk and have a great adventure. Marty agreed. The 
          next morning, Marty and his grandfather left the farmhouse and walked out into the 
          remote fields by their home. To Marty's amazement, a large glowing egg-shaped craft 
          dropped from the sky and landed in front of them. Moments later, a human-looking man 
          stepped out and invited them both onboard. Marty's grandfather explained that it was 
          time for Marty to learn about who his grandfather really was. So began an incredible 
          onboard encounter during which Marty was given a tour of the craft and learned many 
          secrets about the people inside it. It was the first of several other encounters that 
          finally answered some of the strange mysteries surrounding his unusual grandfather.</p>

          <p>These five true cases of UFO contact are just a few of the many accounts that are 
          occurring all across our planet. We are not alone in this universe. We have never 
          been alone.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), 
          California has more UFO sightings than any other state in the United States. So it 
          should come as no surprise that there are many cases involving UFO photographs. In 
          fact, there are hundreds of incidents in which witnesses have been able to capture 
          images of unidentified flying objects.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than fifty cases of some of the best UFO photographs taken in the 
          state of California. Many of these are multiple-witness cases with photographs that have 
          been authenticated by UFO researchers and photographic experts. Some are well-known, while 
          others have received almost no publicity. The majority of these photographs show solid 
          metallic objects hovering in the sky. In some of these cases, it appears that the UFOs 
          want to be seen, and are posing for the witnesses.</p>

          <p>It has often been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. When it comes to UFOs, 
          this is especially true. These amazing photographs provide hard evidence for the reality 
          of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. We are not alone! And these photographs 
          prove it!</p>

          <p>With so many cases, the state of California has had a profound effect on our understanding 
          and knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. If you would like to learn more about UFO activity in 
          California, check out my book,

          <h5>Jul 15, 2022 (0:21:38)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It was a <b>Sunday evening in 1966</b> in Cicero, Illinois. 
          Thirteen-year-old Laura Caigoy and her best friend Ruthie's went outside and waited in 
          the family station wagon, talking and laughing. Laura's mother was coming to pick her up 
          and take Laura to her home.</p>

          <p>Suddenly, Laura heard and felt a low thrumming noise. "Do you hear that?" she asked Ruthie. 
          But Ruthie didn't answer. Laura looked around for the source of the noise, but saw nothing 
          unusual. "Do you hear that?" she asked again. Still, Ruthie didn't respond.</p>

          <p>The sound grew louder, so Laura jumped out of the car and scanned the street. Nothing 
          seemed out of the ordinary, except for the weird thrumming noise. Then, looking up, Laura 
          could hardly believe her eyes. A huge saucer-shaped craft floated just above the 
          streetlights only a block away, and it was moving towards them.</p>

          <p>The craft was large enough to span the entire width of the street. It was a perfect saucer 
          with a little dome on top. A row of windows surrounded the perimeter. The interior of the 
          craft was lit with a brilliant yellow light. It moved leisurely forward at only a few 
          miles per hour.</p>

          <p>Laura screamed Ruthie's name and banged on the car, but Ruthie said nothing. Laura was 
          shocked to see that Cermak Road, which was normally busy with traffic, was now completely 
          empty of cars.</p>

          <p>The craft approached until it was directly overhead. Laura felt no fear, only amazement 
          and awe. Looking down, she saw three people standing nearby, two older women, who seemed 
          not to notice the craft, and another lady staring at her.</p>

          <p>The woman looked strange. Dressed in dark clothes, she was short, had strangely smooth 
          skin, black shiny hair that looked almost painted on, and was wearing dark wrap-around 
          sunglasses, at night!</p>

          <p>"Look!" Laura said, pointing up. "Isn't this amazing?"</p>

          <p>The strange woman looked casually up at the craft and then continued staring at Laura, 
          almost as if studying he. She seemed to be more interested in Laura than the UFO itself!</p>

          <p>The craft was low enough that Laura could've hit it with a rock. It slowly moved off, 
          continuing down the street. Laura followed it down the street for another block, until 
          the road turned into a T-intersection. The craft kept going over the housetops, 
          disappearing into the distance.</p>

          <p>Thrilled by the encounter, Laura rushed back to the car and said softly, "Ruthie?" 
          Her friend instantly bolted upright. Laura told her about the UFO, and Ruthie was 
          shocked. She had passed out. She didn't see anything.</p>

          <p>Years passed. Laura grew up, moved to California, fell in love with a man, got married 
          and had a baby. Twenty-five years later, her son (now five or six years old) began to 
          suffer from unexplained nosebleeds. And so did Laura.</p>

          <p>At the same time, her son experienced severe nightmares in which he said strange tan 
          creatures with huge dark eyes would come into his bedroom. One of them was a creature 
          he called the "bony crab monster" a skeletal spidery-looking being with weird crab-like 
          hands. Her son said that the creatures would levitate him out of the room and into the 
          backyard.</p>

          <p>Laura assumed her son was having vivid nightmares. Then, one evening, the bony crab 
          monster came back and told her son, "Don't be afraid," and cut his finger. The next 
          morning, her son related the 'dream' and showed Laura the cut on his finger.</p>

          <p>Laura was shocked. Could her son's dreams be real? But how was that possible? Weeks 
          later, Laura's husband came home with shocking news. He had seen a UFO -- a large, 
          glowing triangular object.</p>

          <p>Not long after that, Laura had her own sighting of a huge cylindrical-shaped craft, 
          lit up at both ends. To her amazement, it was being chased by a police helicopter.</p>

          <p>She thought of her own childhood sighting. Her son's nightmares also came to mind. 
          Could all of this be related? She decided to look into the subject of UFOs and 
          received an incredible shock. All the strange details seemed to come together. The 
          way Ruthie fell asleep. The strange appearance of the woman with the dark wraparound 
          sunglasses. The unexplained nosebleeds. Her son's nightmares of weird creatures with 
          huge dark eyes." His description of being levitated out of the house. The cut on his 
          finger. Could this all be because of UFOs and aliens?</p>

          <p>Searching her past for clues, Laura now recalled a strange event at age five which 
          back then had made no sense. It was something so bizarre, so unbelievable, she was 
          never able to understand what happened. Now suddenly, it began to make sense.</p>

          <p>Laura's story is one of the more unusual cases of its kind, and it provides some 
          interesting and unique insights about what it's like to have extraterrestrial contact.

          <h5>Jul 8, 2022 (1:15:21)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>May of 2022</b>, after decades of remaining silent, 
          Dolly Safran went public with her experiences as a lifelong fully conscious UFO contactee. 
          As a very young child, Dolly had several encounters involving missing time. Then, in 
          <b>1973</b>, at age 14, she was taken onboard a craft from her home in the Florida 
          Everglades, and was able to remember the entire event without the aid of hypnosis. Since 
          then, she has had more than a thousand fully conscious onboard UFO encounters. She has 
          been taken onboard large motherships, seen a wide variety of extraterrestrials, traveled 
          throughout the solar system and even to other planets. Her story is one of the most 
          extensive cases of UFO contact on record.</p>

          <p>For many years, Dolly had tried to obtain photographs and films of the UFOs, but like 
          most contactees, she discovered it was no easy task. In fact, it's very rare that 
          contactees are able to obtain good photographic evidence. But when Dolly decided to go 
          public with her experiences, she asked the ETs if they would allow themselves to be 
          filmed. To her delight, the ETs agreed!</p>

          <p>In Part One of this series, Dolly described her UFO encounters up to age fourteen. 
          Now, in Part Two, Dolly shares the many photographs and videos she has been able to 
          obtain of the UFO craft. This footage includes both daytime and nighttime footage, 
          various UFO craft, with multiple witnesses in various locations. Dolly's extraordinary 
          video captures include metallic craft posing for the camera, a mothership dropping 
          smaller ET-drones, a craft that performs flips a 180-degree flip, a craft that hovers 
          only a few hundred feet above a house, and more.</p>

          <p>For those who want evidence of UFO reality, here it is! More than twenty photographs 
          and films are presented. Dolly provides a detailed commentary for each photographic 
          event, and explains why obtaining good photographic evidence is not as easy as one might 
          think.</p>
          <p>The photographic evidence presented here is only a portion of the many photos and 
          films she has been able to obtain. You can view more of Dolly's amazing captures on 
          her YouTube Channel, "DOLLYSAFRAN." The link to her channel is provided at the bottom 
          of this description on YouTube.</p>

          <h5>Jul 1, 2022 (0:38:42)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">According to several polls, the majority of people (at least 
          in the USA) believe in the reality of UFOs. Yet, the UFOs themselves remain somewhat 
          evasive. In other words, you can't just go outside and see a UFO anytime you want. And 
          yet, sometimes you can!</p>

          <p>There is a type of UFO behavior that investigators call "displays." In these cases, 
          UFOs will brazenly appear over witnesses and put on a show, darting around and dancing 
          across the sky as though they want to be seen. This type of activity is clearly a 
          publicity campaign, involving what appears to be an agenda to announce their presence 
          and convince people that UFOs are real, and we are not alone.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents seven cases that fit this unique category of UFOs that have 
          overcome their typical shyness and instead are showing off. These types of events have 
          been occurring for decades and are still going on today.</p>
          
          <p><b>1945</b>: Mount Baden-Powell, California. Joe Stein and twenty other young 
          boy-scouts are camping in the forest when a multi-colored object shows up and remains 
          in the sky for most of the night.</p>
          
          <p><b>1954</b>: The Blue Ridge Parkway, Virginia. Bob X. is in the backseat of his 
          parents' car traveling along the highway when an enormous shiny silver disc shows up 
          and begins pacing their car.</p>
          
          <p><b>1970s</b>: Encino, California. Ronny Baron has experienced several UFO sightings 
          throughout his life, but after moving to California he experienced three spectacular 
          displays. One occurred over his home and was also witnessed by his son. A second 
          occurred at a daytime party and was witnessed by twenty people. And a third occurred 
          in the central valley in California.</p>
          
          <p><b>1972</b>: Costa Mesa, California. Traffic stops in the streets, people rush out 
          of their homes and offices, and thousands of people stare upwards to see a humongous, 
          perfectly oval, cloud-like object filled with soft pastel, multi-colored lights scoot 
          across the sky.</p>
          
          <p><b>1978</b>: Palm Springs, California. Chris S., her brother and friend are camping 
          outside when three star-like objects (red, yellow and green) start cavorting and dancing 
          around in the sky, putting on a spectacular display.</p>
          
          <p><b>1983</b>: Lake Naciemento, California. Robert X and six friends observe multiple 
          clusters of lights darting around the night sky for all night long. As they drive around, 
          they see many other people pulling off the road to observe the dramatic display.</p>
          
          <p><b>1990</b>: Pasadena, California. Arni Whyler receives a telepathic message to look 
          outside his window. A UFO instantly appears and performs an incredible maneuver. Shortly 
          later a mysterious beam of light sweeps over his house, followed by an eerie silence and 
          other weird effects. He also experienced another display as a young boy in Cleveland, 
          Ohio.</p>
          
          <p>These seven cases illustrate how the UFO occupants sometimes have no fear of being 
          seen and are in fact announcing their presence. The question is why? Could it be that 
          this is preparation for a future open official contact with all of humanity? Time will 
          tell!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Each UFO encounter provides another piece of the puzzle and 
          offers new insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. This video presents five new 
          and original cases, each of which occurred within a small radius of each other. Each 
          case in this UFO contact cluster contains strange and profound elements which illustrate 
          certain aspects of UFO behavior.</p>
          
          <p><b>December 1968</b>, Paul Allione steps outside his home in Palos Verdes, California 
          and observes an unusual string of lights hovering at low elevation over the Santa 
          Catalina Channel. He grabs his walkie-talkie and attempts to make contact. To his 
          amazement, he overhears a ship's communication talking about the sighting as it is 
          occurring. He soon learns that he is not the only witness to this sighting, and in 
          fact, hundreds of people are seeing the same thing.</p>
          
          <p><b>April 1975</b>, George Gray is driving west on the Santa Monica Freeway when he 
          sees a strange, illuminated object sending down colorful beams of light. When the object 
          darts across the sky, he realizes he's witnessing an actual UFO. He immediately attempts 
          to telepathically communicate with the object, sending it messages of love. To his 
          amazement, the object seems to respond and comes zooming towards him. George pulls over 
          along the Pacific Coast Highway and a has a close-up encounter that he will never forget.</p>
          
          <p><b>Summer, 1980</b>, Donald and Bonnie X. and their children (and neighbors) all 
          view an unidentified red, glowing object silently hovering over their home in Santa 
          Monica. They view the object through binoculars and are amazed to see that this object 
          is semi-circular in shape, and stationary in the sky. Even with binoculars, they are 
          unable to identify it. It's something they've never seen before or since. And then, 
          two days later, they receive incredible confirmation of their sighting from a source 
          very close to home.</p>
          
          <p><b>Summer, 1980</b>, private pilot Toshi Inouye is flying at 2000 feet elevation over 
          the Santa Monica Bay, providing flight instruction to a young student. Shortly after 
          contacting the local airport tower and receiving clearance to land, Toshi and his student 
          view a large, shiny, cigar-shaped light hovering near their plane. Stunned, and unable to 
          identify the weird object, Toshi grabs the radio to question the Santa Monica Airport 
          control tower regarding the object. If there was air traffic this close to him, they 
          should already have informed him. But they haven't! And does he really want to report a 
          UFO? Then, two weeks after the sighting, Toshi's student has a shocking revelation, 
          showing that their sighting was just the beginning of deeper levels of UFO contact.</p>
          
          <p><b>August 4, 2006</b>, retired attorney David Russo decides to take a light night 
          walk to the beach only a few blocks from his home in Long Beach, California. David has 
          often taken late night walks on the beach, however tonight, he is shocked to see a 
          strange triangular craft studded with lights zooming towards him. As it approaches, the 
          craft drops down from the sky, hovering only twenty feet over the water a short distance 
          offshore. It performs incredible maneuvers, as if showing off. David is entranced, and 
          time seems to stop. The sighting affects him profoundly, sending him on a journey of 
          self-discovery that will leave him forever changed.</p>
          
          <p>These five encounters represent a UFO contact cluster, all occurring in virtually the 
          same location, and each of them providing important answers to the many questions 
          surrounding the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <h5>It's not just Roswell!</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many kinds of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, 
          face-to-face contact, onboard UFO encounters and more. But perhaps the ultimate type of 
          UFO encounter is a UFO crash-retrieval incident. In these incredible cases, extraterrestrial 
          craft and ET bodies are allegedly retrieved by military forces and secreted away in various 
          military bases across the United States and the world.</p>

          <p>The <b>1947</b> UFO crash at Roswell, NM is the most famous case of this kind, but it's 
          not the only one. In fact, researchers have documented hundreds of similar events from all 
          over the planet. UFO crash retrievals are far more common than most people think. The state 
          of New Mexico alone has more than a dozen such cases.</p>

          <p>This video presents ten cases of UFO crash retrievals in the state of New Mexico that 
          you may not have heard of before. Moving beyond Roswell, Aztec, Corona or the Plains of 
          St. Augustine (all of which are fairly well-known within the UFO community) -- we move 
          to other lesser-known cases including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the <b>1945</b> UFO crash at San Antonio witnessed by two boys working at an 
              isolated ranch.</li>
            <li>an incident involving the shooting-down a UFO at White Sands only days before 
              the Roswell UFO crash.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash in San Miguel County in <b>1952</b> as witnessed by a young couple 
            vacationing in the area.</li>
            <li>a crash in the deserts of New Mexico in <b>1953</b>, coming from an anonymous 
            Radar Specialist who claims to have seen footage of the crash and bodies.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash at White Sands in <b>1953</b> involving a craft that was recovered 
            almost completely intact.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash in <b>1954</b> outside Walker AFB in which an officer (K.A.) was on 
            a search and rescue mission and came upon a craft and ET bodies.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash in <b>1957</b> as reported by three military officers who investigated 
            rumors of a downed aircraft and found more than they bargained for.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash in <b>1962</b> near Holloman AFB involving a 68-foot metallic disc 
            piloted by two extraterrestrials.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash in <b>1963</b> along the highway near the small town of Santa Rosa, 
            as witnessed by an X-ray technician who view the craft and bodies.</li>
            <li>a UFO crash in <b>1974</b> in the Manzano Mountains near the small town of Chili, 
            as reported to APRO by an officer at Kirtland AFB.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It was only because of sheer luck and the courage of various whistle-blowers that these 
          ten cases were reported to various UFO researchers. Likely these cases represent only the 
          tip of the iceberg, meaning that there are probably dozens of other cases or more that the 
          public does not know about in the state of New Mexico alone!</p>

          <p>During the recent Congressional UFO Hearings in <b>May of 2022</b>, the U.S. government 
          stated their desire to be truthful and transparent on the subject of UFOs and UAPS, and 
          their desire to remove the stigma surrounding the subject of extraterrestrials. And yet, 
          when asked if the U.S. military has ever shot at a craft, or if the military is in 
          possession of any materials from a craft, they said, "no," and said that the stories of 
          Roswell were mere rumors! Does this sound like truth and transparency?</p>

          <p>No more cover-ups! No more lies! The time for truth is now! The subject of UFO crash 
          retrievals can no longer be ignored or denied. The cases are numerous and come from many 
          highly credible witnesses. UFO crash retrievals represent the cutting edge of UFO research 
          and have the potential to prove the reality of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet 
          to all of humanity.</p>

          <h5>Jun 3, 2022 (1:08:05)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Late one <b>evening in January of 1973</b>, fourteen-year-old 
          Dolly Safran (who lived near the Everglades in Florida) looked outside her window to 
          observe more than fifty star-like objects swarming overhead. As they began to dart off 
          in different directions, one of these objects dropped down and hovered at treetop level 
          behind her house.</p>

          <p>The object now revealed itself to be a solid metallic craft, with portholes. And 
          through the portholes, Dolly was shocked to see two short, gray-skinned figures with 
          large dark eyes and huge black heads. Aliens, she realized, and they were looking right 
          at her! She turned to dive under her bed. At that moment, her room exploded in brilliant 
          blue light.</p>

          <p>The next thing Dolly knew, hours had passed and morning had arrived. Dolly found 
          herself on the floor of her room, dressed in someone else's pajamas, which were on 
          inside out and backwards. She had been taken, she realized. It had happened again.</p>

          <p>Throughout her young life, this sort of thing had happened several times. But this 
          time, she resolved to remember. And when the radio came on and said that there had been 
          other witnesses, Dolly got the confirmation she needed. She wasn't crazy. She really 
          was seeing UFOs.</p>

          <p>She sat down in the bathroom and began to concentrate, meditate, focus. And all at 
          once, the wall of amnesia started to crumble and memories of being taken onboard the 
          craft flooded into her mind.</p>

          <p>Dolly had to go to school that day, and she received further confirmation when her 
          best friend also reported seeing a UFO on the same night. By the end of the day, Dolly 
          remembered everything that had happened to her that night. And not only did she remember 
          that night, she was able to recall the many other times she had been taken, going all 
          the way back to her first contact event when she was only ten months old and she floated 
          right out of her crib.</p>

          <p>Suddenly, all those weird events of missing time made sense. Dolly recalled many other 
          instances of contact. She recalled the time at age two where he was missing for two hours 
          and was found six miles away from her home. She had been taken.</p>

          <p>She remembered an incident at age six when a craft came down and took her from the 
          front yard of her home. She recalled many other instances too.</p>

          <p>But her experience at age fourteen changed everything. She recalled being taken 
          onboard the craft and meeting short little grays, and a much taller gray she called 
          "Momma." She was given a tour of the craft. The craft itself was a living being, and 
          Dolly recalled meeting him many times. She called him "Tlera." </p>

          <p>During this onboard experience, Dolly was taken to the control room, which the ETs 
          called "the place of movement." She was instructed to sit in the pilot seat and to her 
          amazement and delight, the craft left Earth and they traveled to Saturn. After exploring 
          Saturn's rings and many moons, they traveled to Earth's moon, actually landing upon its 
          surface.</p>

          <p>Dolly had a long conversation with the ETs, and they offered her the opportunity to 
          learn from them and work alongside them. She was given the freedom to choose any subject 
          she wanted to explore. "Can I learn how to fly the craft?" Dolly asked.</p>

          <p>The ETs agreed. And so began Dolly's lifelong experiences as a fully conscious UFO 
          contactee. She soon began having fantastic adventures including visiting large 
          motherships filled with plants and animals, traveling to other planets and star-systems 
          and meeting with a wide variety of ETs. It was a fantastic adventure that is still going 
          on to this day.</p>

          <p>This video presents Dolly's story up to age fourteen, including many of her childhood 
          experiences, and her incredible awakening at age fourteen where she was taken onboard 
          the craft and then traveled across the solar system, starting a lifetime of fully 
          conscious contact.</p>

          <p>Dolly's story of extraterrestrial contact is one of the most extensive and profound 
          cases on record. If you would like to explore more about her many UFO encounters, you 
          can read about them in my new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VF3J8NR/..."

          <h5>May 27, 2022 (0:42:20)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Located west of Los Angeles, California, nestled in the Santa 
          Monica Mountains, the small community of Topanga Canyon has long been known as a UFO 
          hotspot. In fact, on <b>June 14, 1992</b>, numerous people called the local police 
          station and newspaper office reporting UFOs. And for the next two years, a wave of 
          encounters inundated the area. Sightings, landings, UFO-car chases, bedroom visitations, 
          abductions and more occurred at an unprecedented rate. This became known as the Topanga 
          Canyon UFO wave.</p>

          <p>But this wave was not an isolated event. Encounters occurred before this wave, and 
          they continued to occur after it. This video presents a selection of ten of some of the 
          more interesting and unique UFO encounters in this very active area. They show how 
          strange and unusual the UFO phenomenon can be, and provide some profound insights into 
          how UFOs behave and interact with people on Earth.</p>

          <p>For example, there is the case of Ethan Holtzman, who was experiencing a powerful 
          feeling of deja-vu when suddenly a blazing red UFO dropped down from the sky over his 
          vehicle.</p>

          <p>Or the case of Dr. David Philips (a college professor) who was woken up in the early 
          hours of the morning to hear helicopters hovering over the canyon, sending down 
          searchlights as if looking for something. A few minutes later, he saw what they were 
          apparently looking for: a shiny silver disc evading the helicopters and scooting south 
          down the canyon.</p>

          <p>Or the case of Bruce Merrifield and Reyna Massey, who while driving through the canyon, 
          were confronted by an enormous metallic craft studded with colored lights hovering a mere 
          twenty feet over the nearby ridge. As soon as they saw it, the craft turned up on its side 
          and flashed its lights at them.</p>

          <p>Or the case of Samantha, who was driving near her home adjacent to Topanga State Park 
          when she saw a mysterious red orb zipping across the sky, appearing and disappearing, 
          turning at right angles, and drawing weird geometric shapes in the sky. Afterwards, 
          Samantha began to have memories of being taken onboard a UFO.</p>

          <p>Or the case of Taylor, who had just moved into the canyon, and began to see fleets of 
          UFOs and even a mother ship. The UFOs appeared so many times and came so close, that 
          Taylor ended up moving out of the canyon a short time later.</p>

          <p>Or the case of Valerie Dennett, who looked out her window to see an exceptionally 
          bright star in the sky. She made a wish upon the star when suddenly it blinked out, and 
          in its place was an object with blue and red lights. Looking outside, Valerie saw two 
          other identical objects hovering in the sky. Feeling like the object was watching her, 
          and feeling concern for her newborn baby, Valerie tried to wake up her boyfriend. But 
          her boyfriend could not be awakened.</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the many unusual extraterrestrial encounters which have 
          occurred (and continue to occur) in Topanga Canyon. It's one of California's most 
          active hotspots, producing virtually the entire range of UFO encounters. If you want 
          to see a UFO, this is the place to be.</p>

          LANDING TRACE CASES</a></h2>

          <h5>May 20, 2022 (1:52:01)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, 
          landings, face-to-face contact, onboard UFO encounters, crash/retrievals and more. UFO 
          skeptics often say that these cases rely solely on eyewitness testimony with no 
          supporting hard physical evidence. But this is simply not true.</p>

          <p>Most sightings have multiple eyewitness testimony. Some are supported by lie-detector 
          tests, radar-returns, photographs and films. Many encounters display a wide variety of 
          evidence such as electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects 
          (injuries and healings,) angel hair, implants (which appear on x-rays and MRIs, and 
          have in some cases been removed and subjected to scientific study) and more. There is 
          a lot more evidence for UFOs than most people realize.</p>

          <p>One of the most compelling types of evidence is known as UFO landing traces. Close 
          Encounters of the Second Kind are those cases which affect the physical environment in 
          some way. The ultimate example of this are the UFO landing traces cases.</p>

          <p>There are thousands of reports of UFO landings. And there are hundreds upon hundreds 
          of these which involve hard physical evidence in the form of landing traces.</p>

          <p>Landing traces come in many different forms including crushed vegetation, swirled 
          grass, accelerated growth of vegetation, gouges in the earth, compacted soil, burn 
          marks, soil that shows evidence of having been exposed to a high heat source, radiation 
          readings, and more.</p>

          <p>This video presents a chronology of more than thirty UFO landing trace cases. They 
          come from all across our planet, reach back many decades in time, and are still 
          occurring today.</p>

          <p>Some of these cases are very well known, such as the Socorro, NM UFO landing in <b>1964</b>; 
          the Tully, Australia UFO landing in <b>1966</b>; the Delphos, Kansas UFO landing in <b>1971</b>; 
          the Langenburg, Canada UFO landing in <b>1974</b>; the Trans-En-Provence, France UFO landing in 
          <b>1981</b>; and the Voronezh, Russia UFO landing in <b>1989</b>, to name a few! However, the 
          vast majority of UFO landing trace cases have received almost no publicity whatsoever.</p>

          <p>This video presents these well-known cases, and many which are not well-known. All of 
          these cases provide hard physical evidence of UFOs. Many of the landing traces have been 
          studied in scientific labs.</p>

          <p>The cases presented here are only a small portion of the actual number of cases. The 
          time for skepticism is over. These landing trace cases provide conclusive proof that we 
          are being visited by UFOs and extraterrestrials. To ignore them would be wholly 
          unscientific.</p>

          <p>Where are these cases taking place? What actually happens when a UFO lands on our planet? 
          What do these cases have to say about the nature and origin of the UFO phenomenon? The 
          answers are here!<br>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are not only seen in the skies above us. They are also 
          seen in our oceans. Researchers call them, "USOs" or unidentified submersible objects. 
          And there are a lot of them!</p>

          <p>USOs are seen all over the world, but one of the most active areas on our planet is 
          off the coast of Southern California, specifically, the Santa Catalina and San Pedro 
          Channel. This body of water has produced more than 150 documented cases of UFOs and 
          USOs. With an average depth of about 3000 feet, and some areas one mile deep, there 
          are plenty of places for USOs to hide.</p>

          <p>Objects have been seen diving into the water, and flying out, sometimes both! One of 
          the most interesting types of USO encounters are cases in which these craft have targeted 
          boaters. There are nearly a dozen cases on record in which UFOs hover directly over boaters, 
          or even more incredibly, precisely beneath them. Cases have been occurring for decades and 
          are still happening today.</p>

          <p>On <b>July 10, 1955</b>, the Washington family was in their boat thirteen miles off 
          the coast of Newport Beach when a UFO appeared right over their boat and began to follow 
          them. They called the Coast Guard who agreed to send out a plane to investigate. No sooner 
          had they hung up the radio when the UFO darted away.</p>

          <p>In <b>July of 1987</b>, a group of people were making a night-crossing from Catalina 
          Island to Rancho Palos Verdes, when a UFO approached and again, stopped over their boat. 
          With a very unusual appearance and making no sound, it was clearly not a conventional 
          aircraft.</p>

          <p>On <b>January 3, 2004</b>, a gentleman by the name of Young Chyren was shocked to 
          see a UFO hovering right over a sailboat only a short distance off the shore of Santa 
          Monica. When the object remained in place, he quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a 
          photograph, which clearly shows a metallic disc-shaped object, providing more evidence 
          that UFOs are targeting boaters.</p>

          <p>Even more compelling are those cases in which UFOs (or rather, USOs!) approach boats 
          from underwater. A dramatic case occurred in the <b>late 1980s</b> to an anonymous 
          electronics engineer who was sailing his fully equipped yacht to Santa Cruz Island when 
          a massive, round, glowing, green craft targeted his boat and moved directly underneath 
          it, causing his compasses, depth-sounders and electrical equipment to all fail at once.</p>

          <p>Or consider the case of a gentleman who was sailing along the coast of Catalina 
          Island at night when a gigantic square of glowing white light appeared under his boat, 
          illuminating the water for hundreds of feet around him.</p>

          <p>Or the case of a gentleman who was in the Channel Islands area when he saw what 
          he first thought might be whales swimming under his boat. Then one approached closely 
          and he saw that it wasn't a whale; instead it was a round, silvery metallic, 
          saucer-shaped object.</p>

          <p>These are just a few of the many cases in which USOs are targeting boaters in the 
          Santa Catalina channel. This video presents a chronology of these very interesting 
          encounters, including one case in which a boat was actually sunk by a USO!</p>

          <p>Why are UFOs targeting boaters? Are they curious? Are they trying to announce their 
          presence? Where are these objects coming from? How many are there? What is the motive 
          behind this very unusual aspect of UFO behavior?</p>

          <p>This video presents the best cases of boaters that have been targeted by USOs, and 
          answers many of the questions surrounding these types of accounts.</p>

          DUDLEY DELANEY’S<br>
          ALIEN<br>
          ENCOUNTER</a></h2>
        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>May 6, 2022 (0:23:44)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In the <b>late 1940s</b>, young teenager, Dudley Delany was 
          listening to the popular radio host Frank Edwards talk about UFOs being seen in the 
          skies across the world. Dudley was amazed and entranced. Extraterrestrials were visiting 
          our world? The idea seemed fantastic, and yet there were so many reports. So began 
          Dudley's lifelong fascination with the subject.</p>
          
          <p>Dudley now believed in UFOs, but he certainly didn't think he was personally 
          involved. He grew up and became very interested in medicine. He went to school and 
          became first a registered nurse, then a licensed chiropractor, and also a licensed 
          massage therapist. So began Dr. Delany's lifelong mission to help and heal humanity.</p>
          
          <p>Then one morning, he woke to a puzzling mystery. There was a strange lump on his 
          cheek. It hadn't been there the day before. How had it appeared so quickly, seemingly 
          overnight? The strange mystery concerned him, and one day he decided to take action. 
          Thinking it was perhaps a boil, he sterilized a needle and started to pierce and drain 
          the boil. To his shock, out popped a tiny crystal-like object! Dudley was confused. 
          How could a crystal be lodged inside his body? It made no sense. But with no 
          explanation, he forgot about it.</p>
          
          <p>Years passed. Then in <b>1991</b>, Dudley (now in his fifties) started to feel 
          unwell. He went to the doctor and received a devastating diagnosis: he was suffering 
          from multiple sclerosis. Always interested in alternative healing, Dudley began 
          researching ways to heal himself and came upon the work of the world-famous psychic, 
          Edgar Cayce, who was known for diagnosing and healing people of a wide variety of 
          illnesses.</p>

          <p>Dudley found information about how to heal his own condition, and it worked! His 
          MS went into full remission. Delighted, Dudley wrote a book about his healing 
          experience and became a strong proponent of alternative healing.</p>

          <p>Then, one <b>evening in 1998</b>, not long after he had retired, Dudley had his 
          first unambiguously UFO-related encounter. He woke up to see a beam of light coming 
          through the roof and ceiling of his home, striking his body where he lay in bed. 
          What, he wondered, was that? A beam of light from a UFO?</p>

          <p>A few years later, in <b>early 2001</b>, Dudley had another strange experience. 
          He woke one evening to sense a presence in his room. He felt and heard something 
          or someone sit on the bed next to him. Then he felt a strange hand grasping his own. 
          Alarmed, he quickly opened his eyes and turned around. But the room was empty. Again 
          he wondered, what was that? A ghost? An alien? He wasn't sure.</p>

          <p>But he began to research the subject, and asking other members of his family, he was 
          shocked when his niece revealed that she herself had been taken onboard a UFO at age 
          ten, where she met both grays and human-looking ETs. This provided Dudley with some 
          confirmation of his own experiences.</p>

          <p>In <b>July of 2001</b>, Dudley traveled to Virginia Beach to attend a conference at 
          the Edgar Cayce Foundation. He had a wonderful time meeting with like-minded people and 
          talking about alternative healing and UFOs. Then, one evening he went to bed and had 
          the single most profound UFO encounter of his entire life. At the time he had been 
          experiencing prostate problems which were causing him pain and difficulties with 
          urination. That evening, he woke up to find that he was no longer in his room. 
          Instead, he was apparently onboard an ET craft, lying upon a table.</p>

          <p>Unable to move or speak, he watched as a short humanoid approached and began to 
          conduct a procedure, telling Dudley that he had a tumor, and that he was there to be 
          healed. Dudley felt no fear, and was in fact, amazed and delighted to receive a healing 
          at the hands of ETs. Following the procedure, his prostate problems disappeared.</p>

          <p>Dudley now examined his past in a new light. Suddenly all those weird events began 
          to make sense. The weird crystal in his cheek. Could that have been an alien implant? 
          The beam of light that came through the ceiling, the strange nighttime visitor in his 
          bedroom -- perhaps he had been having more contact than he realized. Then he remembered 
          a weird event which occurred when he was a young teenager, something so strange and 
          personal that he had never told anyone, or even though about. But now, with the benefit 
          of hindsight, it suddenly made sense. And he wondered if it was possible that his 
          contact with ETs had started much earlier than he had ever imagined. And perhaps he 
          had hybrid alien-human children!</p>

          <p>This video presents the story of Dr. Dudley Delany's lifelong alien encounters, and 
          provides some interesting insights into the UFO contact experience.</p>

          contact encounters, please check out my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0949H5Y8G/..."

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It may sound strange and unusual, but there are now several 
          documented cases on record in which people have met ETs, been taken onboard an 
          extraterrestrial craft and shown an alien book. It doesn't happen often, but there are 
          more cases than you might think.</p>

          <p>One very well-known case is Betty Hill, who was taken onboard a UFO with her husband, 
          Barney in <b>1961</b> in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. While on the craft, Betty 
          was given a large book, filled with alien symbols in long narrow columns.</p>

          <p>Another famous case is Betty Andreasson, a lifelong contactee from Massachusetts, who 
          was given a thin blue book with glowing white pages, and was actually allowed to keep it 
          in her home and study it for a short period of time.</p>

          <p>These cases are not unique. A fascinating case involving an alien book comes from 
          Jeff Selver, a Canadian businessman who has recently and courageously stepped forward 
          to reveal his encounters with ETs. During an onboard UFO encounter at age sixteen, he 
          was handed a "mystic book" and told to study its contents. The book was filled with 
          deeply spiritual messages that would alter the course of his life.</p>

          <p>Researcher Richard Boylan Ph.D., reports on the case of "Mike," a contactee from 
          northern California. While onboard a craft, Mike was shown a book with a strange alien 
          symbol on the cover, was instructed to read it, and was told he would remember the 
          contents later in life. The alien book ended up having a profound influence on his life.</p>

          <p>Researcher David Jacobs Ph.D., also reports on an unusual case in which a young girl 
          was taken onboard to meet with a human-ET hybrid. They both sat down and read an alien 
          book together.</p>

          <p>This video presents nearly a dozen firsthand cases of people who have been given alien 
          books by the extraterrestrials. Several of them have never been published before and are 
          revealed here for the first time.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most interesting and extensive case comes from Dolly Safran, a fully 
          conscious contactee from Florida who has only recently stepped forward to reveal her 
          lifelong contacts with extraterrestrials. In a live firsthand interview, Dolly reveals 
          her experiences with a sapphire-blue ET book which she has studied for countless hours 
          while onboard the ET craft.</p>

          <p>What do these books look like? Why are contactees being given these books? What kind 
          of knowledge do these alien books contain? And most importantly, how are they affecting 
          those who have had the fantastic opportunity to read them?</p>

          <p>This video answers all these questions and more, and provides a study and comparative 
          analysis of these very unusual events. Told in the witnesses' own words, with witness 
          drawings and firsthand interviews, the secret messages in these alien books are finally 
          being revealed.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This is the story of Julia (pseudonym) and her encounters with 
          a gray alien named Sen. At age 19, Julia left her family and home in Prunedale, California. 
          Her childhood had been difficult, filled with unexplained events. She had tried to get help 
          from her parents, but they were strict and didn't understand. So Julia left everything 
          behind and decided to get as far away from her home as she could.</p>

          <p>She ended up settling on the east coast of the United States, where she began to 
          rebuild her life. She found a job, a place to live. She started her own small business, 
          made friends, and met the man who would one day become her husband. Finally secure, she 
          began to examine her childhood, trying to figure out the source of her trauma. She 
          remembered terrifying events during which her room would fill with light and shadowy 
          figures would approach her. She came upon the subject of aliens and UFOs. That's 
          probably what happened she realized. It was aliens. But the whole idea terrified her 
          and she refused to think about it.</p>

          <p>A few years later, Julia felt a powerful compulsion to move back to California. 
          Although her life was going great, she and her boyfriend picked up everything and 
          moved to Pacific Grove, not far from her childhood home. The very day they finished 
          moving in, strange things began to happen.</p>

          <p>It started with a weird ringing sound in her right ear. She went to the doctor, but 
          he couldn't explain it. There were no insects in her ear canal as she feared. It wasn't 
          tinnitus. The doctor had no diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Then came the UFO sightings, weird glowing orbs hovering over the house. Then one 
          evening, there was a ship overhead. Julia saw it through the skylight above her bed. 
          Next thing she knew, she was paralyzed. A short time later, she fell asleep.</p>

          <p>In the morning, she told her boyfriend. She could no longer live in denial. The 
          memories of her childhood experiences were flooding back. The excruciating tones in 
          her right ear were becoming unbearable. UFOs were hovering over their house. She 
          finally found the reason for her problems. It was aliens. They had visited her since 
          she was a girl. Now they were back, And she believed the source of the tones in her 
          ear was probably an alien implant.</p>

          <p>Her husband was shocked, but he was also very supportive. He believed her, but had 
          no idea how to help her. Deeply in love, they got married.</p>

          <p>Julia examined her childhood. She remembered seeing colorful orbs as a little girl. 
          She recalled the hundreds of times her bedroom would fill with light and scary shadowy 
          figures would materialize around her. She remembered a dramatic UFO sighting at age ten 
          of a giant flying saucer. Julia could no longer deny that she was having contact with 
          extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p>Then one evening, she woke up to hear a weird musical sound reverberating through the 
          house. She wandered around, trying to locate the source. Then she realized, it was inside 
          her head! Next thing she knew, Julia found herself being pulled onboard a craft. She saw 
          that she was laying on a table in a small, round room, surrounded by short, thin, 
          gray-skinned beings with large bald heads and big dark eyes.</p>

          <p>They handed her a baby and asked her to hold it. It looked just like a gray alien. 
          Julia was shocked. And looking outside the craft, she saw the darkness of space, and 
          far below her, the planet Earth.</p>

          <p>Next thing she knew, it was morning, and she was back in bed. Looking at her stomach, 
          she saw three bleeding puncture wounds. Both Julia and her husband were shocked and 
          traumatized. And they became even more shocked when they discovered that Julia was pregnant.</p>

          <p>From this point, events escalated. Julia kept waking up to find herself unable to 
          move. One evening, her husband woke up to see a gray alien entering their bedroom. 
          Shortly later, Julia had a miscarriage. She was secretly relieved. The pregnancy had 
          not felt normal, and she was certain that it had something to do with the night she was 
          taken onboard a craft.</p>

          <p>At that point, her experiences ended. Or so she thought. They fled California, and 
          moved to the east coast. They had a baby boy, and became pregnant with their second child. 
          Then, one morning, Julia decided to reach out mentally to contact the gray alien baby she 
          had held in her arms years ago. To her shock, she made instant contact. In her mind, she 
          saw a gray. He introduced himself and said his name was Sen and that he was made up of her 
          DNA. Then began an hours-long conversation in which Julia learned all the answers about 
          everything that had happened to her throughout her life.</p>

          <p>This video tells the story of Julia's encounters, and what she learned from Sen about 
          her own encounters and the alien agenda on our planet. If you'd like to explore more, 
          Julia's story is presented in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0949H5Y8G/..."

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is sometimes human nature to shoot first and ask questions 
          later. This concept is perfectly illustrated with UFO encounters. In fact, there are 
          dozens of cases on record involving shoot-outs between humans and UFOs and aliens.</p>

          <p>This video presents nearly two dozen cases in which people have shot at UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials. Cases like these reach all the way back to the <b>1940s</b>, the 
          beginning of the Modern Age of UFOs, and continue up to the present day. Police officers, 
          security guards, military personnel, hunters, ranchers and many others have all shot at 
          UFOs.</p>

          <p>What happens when someone shoots at a UFO? Does it affect the UFO? Will the ETs react 
          by defending themselves? The cases here show exactly what happens. And the results might 
          surprise you.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On the <b>evening of December 26, 1988</b>, Teri Smith 
          (a physical therapist) went to sleep with her boyfriend Brian in a bedroom in a large 
          condominium complex located in Chatsworth, California. At some point in the middle of 
          the night, Teri woke to a strange thrumming noise and the feeling that somebody was 
          in the room. She found herself unable to move or speak. As she struggled against the 
          strange force, she felt four prong-like "things" grabbing her ankle, causing pain. 
          Terrified, she finally managed to open her eyes and was confronted by a baffling sight.</p>
          
          <p>At the foot of her bed was a large glowing misty-like entity. As she sat up, this 
          entity quickly darted out through the closed window of the bedroom. Looking outside, 
          Teri was shocked to see a huge UFO landed in the alley behind the condominium. The 
          strange figure entered into the landed object, which promptly took off straight up. 
          Only then did Teri's boyfriend Brian finally wake up. He hadn't seen anything. 
          Neither had three other adults and a child who were also in the condo. But Teri knew 
          what she had experienced. It wasn't a dream.</p>
          
          <p>The next day, the entire experience had completely left her mind. It was only while 
          she was at her place of employment when she felt a strong pain in her ankle and a 
          soreness in her neck that the events of the previous night flooded back into her 
          mind.</p>
          
          <p>After work, Teri called her best friend, Traci Stoor, and told her what happened. 
          Traci was shocked. Traci hadn't told Teri,  but Tracy had been having these kinds of 
          experiences for many years. Now it seemed that they had spread to her friend Teri. 
          And not only that, on the same night of Teri's encounter, Traci's boyfriend, George, 
          had also had an encounter, and it was identical to Teri's down to the tiniest detail! 
          This remarkable turn of events was too strange to be a coincidence, and it provided 
          Teri with confirmation that her own experience was absolutely real.</p>
          
          <p>Meanwhile, attention turned to Traci, who confirmed both Teri's and George's 
          encounters, and also had her own encounters. Traci revealed that she had experienced 
          a face-to-face visitation with an alien entity in a location that one would never 
          expect.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents the story of a small group of friends, and how Traci's UFO 
          encounters spread like a contagion among her two best friends. It reveals many of 
          the standard patterns of UFO contact, and shows how encounters can happen in the 
          least likely locations.</p>

          <h5>Apr 1, 2022 (0:19:00)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>January 2006</b>, a young couple, Charles and Maria 
          (pseudonyms) moved into their new home on the east coast of Canada. They were quite 
          busy with moving in, repairing the house, starting a new business and dealing with 
          red-tape from the Canadian government about insurance and other issues, when they 
          became pregnant. While they had been hoping to start a family, they wanted to settle 
          in first. Still, it was good news and quite exciting for them both.</p>

          <p>They went to the doctor, verified the pregnancy and hired a midwife. They informed 
          both their families of the happy news, and transformed one of the rooms in their home 
          into a nursery for the baby.</p>

          <p>The pregnancy proceeded smoothly. They visited the doctor and midwife regularly. 
          At around three or four months, both Maria and Charles felt the baby kicking and 
          squirming. Her belly grew larger and larger. Thankfully, she only suffered a minor 
          case of morning sickness.</p>

          <p>Then in <b>July 2006</b>, about seven months into the pregnancy, something strange 
          happened. They were driving to their friends' house to attend a dinner party, and 
          somehow became lost and disoriented. To their shock, they arrived at their destination 
          far sooner than they should have. But unable to explain it, they just ignored it and 
          moved on with their lives.</p>

          <p>Other than the baby moving into a breech position, the pregnancy was still going 
          fine. Their midwife prescribed exercises to help encourage the baby to move into the 
          proper position for birth.</p>

          <p>Then, two weeks later, on <b>August 2, 2006</b> (at seven and a half months pregnancy), 
          they went to sleep and awoke to a violent electrical storm over their house. The bolts 
          of lightning were massive and quite unusual, traveling horizontally across their backyard. 
          Frightened for their safety, Charles jumped up and closed the window. The next thing 
          they knew, it was morning. That was weird; neither could understand how they fell 
          asleep so quickly.</p>

          <p>Both Charles and especially Maria felt a bit dazed and groggy. Maria felt almost as 
          though she had been anesthetized. And looking down at her belly, she was shocked to see 
          that it had shrunk in size. Not only that, she no longer felt pregnant. She told her 
          husband, who said that perhaps the baby had moved away from a breech position. Maria 
          hoped that was the case, but she didn't think so. She also noticed three strange 
          puncture wounds in a triangular position on the arch of her foot.</p>

          <p>Concerned, they went to see their midwife. To their dismay, the midwife was unable to 
          detect the baby's heartbeat and urged them to visit their doctor immediately, which they 
          did.</p> 

          <p>The doctor ran some tests and then told them the devastating news: Maria was no longer
          pregnant. Charles and Maria were shocked and began crying. There was no explanation. She 
          had not had any problems. There was no miscarriage. Blood tests had confirmed the pregnancy. 
          They both had heard the heartbeat numerous times. Not only that, they felt the baby kicking.
          Still, the doctor told them that she was not pregnant, and that perhaps there had been a
          mis-diagnosis. Neither Charles nor Maria believed this to be the case.</p>

          <p>Thus began a search for answers, but there were none. The only explanation that they 
          could find was the "missing fetus syndrome." They learned that women who had experienced 
          UFO encounters sometimes lost their babies under mysterious circumstances. Could this be 
          what happened to them?</p>

          <p>Examining their past, they found several clues. Charles had seen UFOs, and so had his 
          father. Maria reported dreaming about "light beings" and on a few occasions had actually 
          seen them in her bedroom. Then there was that weird incident on the way to their friends' 
          house. The problem was, most of the cases they found occurred at three or four months. 
          They were seven and a half months pregnant!</p>

          <p>This video presents the story and Charles and Maria and their experience with the 
          missing fetus syndrome. While they can't prove that aliens took their baby, neither 
          of them can find any other explanation. It's an important case that illustrates one 
          of the ET agendas involving human reproduction.</p>

          <h5>Mar 25, 2022 (0:25:55)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1963</b>, the Sanz family moved into their new home in 
          Arleta, California. The two daughters, Karen (age 6) and Susan (age 2) shared a room. 
          One evening, Karen awoke to an incredible shock: a strange boogie-man-like figure emerged 
          from the closet, floated across the room and went to her little sister's crib. She watched 
          in fear as the short, big-eyed creature poked its hand through the bars of the crib. 
          Fearing that Susan was going to be taken away, Karen tried to get up. Instead, she 
          found herself falling asleep. That was the first visit from the muddy man. But it wasn't 
          the last.</p>

          <p>Soon the muddy man returned. A week or two later, Karen woke up, and watched again 
          as this same creature appeared and went directly to Susan's crib. It looked at Karen, 
          but once more remained by Susan's crib. Despite trying to stay awake, Karen fell asleep. 
          When it happened a third time a week later, Karen told her parents. "You're just having 
          a nightmare," they told her.</p>

          <p>But Karen knew it wasn't a nightmare. She was awake. And it kept happening. Week 
          after week, month after month, this muddy man kept appearing, always going to Susan's 
          crib. No matter how hard she tried, Karen could not stay awake. Unable to convince her 
          parents, Karen had nobody to talk to about it.</p>

          <p>Years passed, but the visits continued, soon mounting into the hundreds. Always, 
          the weird creature emerged from the closet area, and went directly to Susan. Even 
          when they re-arranged the positions of the beds, it was always the same. The muddy 
          man seemed only interested in Susan.</p>

          <p>Unknown to Karen, Susan had also begun to see the muddy man. She was now old 
          enough to realize that something was wrong, and that whoever or whatever this figure 
          was, it wasn't human. It was short, bald, with a huge head and large dark, wraparound 
          eyes. After several such visits, Susan (like Karen had) told her parents about what 
          was happening. Again, her parents assumed it was a nightmare.</p>

          <p>One time, Susan saw the figure appear in the closet holding a strange black box. 
          And standing next to the figure was Susan's mother. Except it wasn't her mother. 
          Instead, Susan was convinced it was something else, a disguise. Like Karen, Susan 
          was never able to stay awake.</p>

          <p>More weird events occurred. Susan would sometimes hear her name being called in her 
          head, over and over, "Susan! Susan! Susan!" Another time, the family went to visit Zuma 
          Beach. Susan was in the water when she became disoriented and felt like she was being 
          dragged away. There was a strange unexplained shift, and she found herself in a 
          different location. Looking back in hindsight, she realizes this was a classic case 
          of missing time.</p>

          <p>At the time, neither Karen nor Susan had ever heard of aliens or extraterrestrials. 
          Neither of them had ever seen a UFO, so they had no idea how to interpret what was 
          happening to them.</p> 

          <p>Then, in <b>1969</b>, after six years, the visitations abruptly ended. Things 
          began to return back to normal. Susan, however, was left with anxiety. Certain 
          big-eyed cartoon characters sent chills down her spine. She began dreaming about 
          UFOs hovering over her house.</p>

          <p>But it wasn't until <b>1988</b>, when Karen and Susan (now adults) returned home 
          for Thanksgiving that they reminisced about their childhood and began to connect to 
          the dots. Susan told her sister that she used to have weird waking nightmares about 
          a creature that would emerge from the closet. "The Muddy Man!" Karen said. "I saw it 
          too!" Only then did they realize that they had been seeing the same thing. And when 
          images of gray aliens began to appear on television, they finally had their answer 
          about what the creature was. It was a gray alien.</p>

          <p>Susan was shocked, and reading about UFOs, she was amazed to see how closely their 
          experiences matched those of other people. The only thing was, they had never seen a 
          UFO. But that was about to change. Just a few years later, Susan's five-year-old 
          daughter reported seeing a "little boy" in her bedroom. That was when the unexplained 
          nosebleeds began. And weird scoop marks on their bodies.</p>

          <p>In <b>1991</b>, Karen went back home to live with her parents. To her shock, the 
          muddy man came for another visit.</p>

          <p>One year later, in <b>1992</b>, Susan woke up one morning to see a UFO landing in 
          her backyard. Several gray aliens emerged. They were angry. Susan had agreed to go 
          on television in a few days to talk about her encounters. The ETs made it clear, 
          they didn't want her to go public. Susan cancelled her TV appearance.</p>

          <p>But soon the UFOs were back, and this time Susan's husband Hector was a witness. 
          This video presents the true story of a long and complex series of UFO contacts that 
          changed the lives of two sisters forever. It reveals many of the patterns of UFO 
          contact.</p>

          <h5>Mar 18, 2022 (0:27:00)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1975</b>, the Robinson Family (pseudonym) left their 
          home in the San Fernando Valley in southern California to spend the weekend in a cabin 
          located in Cedar Pines, in the remote wilderness of the San Bernardino National Forest. 
          Little did they know, this weekend vacation would mark the beginning of a series of UFO 
          encounters that would involve their entire family.</p>
          
          <p>That evening, the mother, Diane Robinson, looked out the window of the cabin and saw 
          a large round object covered with white lights, hovering and darting around before 
          quickly zipping off. Meanwhile, in the lower cabin, her two young daughters (Jenny and 
          Kelly) and their cousin, also observed the object. All the witnesses were deeply 
          impressed that they had seen a genuine UFO. But it was just a simple sighting, and 
          they thought that would be the end of it. But it was just the beginning.</p>

          <p>Years later, in <b>1982</b>, Kelly Robinson (now a teenager), traveled south to the 
          small town of Julian to spend a few weeks at a church camp located in the remote Volcan 
          Mountains. Laying outside one evening watching the stars, Kelly and her friends were 
          amazed to see a star-like object flitting across the sky. It moved super-fast and at 
          acute angles, making it obvious that it could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon, 
          shooting star, satellite or any other conventional object. It was a UFO. After 
          watching this object dance across the sky, Kelly and her friends became frightened 
          and retreated inside. None of them talked about the sighting.</p>

          <p>Over the next few years, Kelly returned to the same church camp in Julian, and on 
          at least two other occasions, witnessed more UFOs. One time they watched an object 
          for over an hour. It became an interesting and fun activity to look for UFOs, but it 
          also made Kelly slightly nervous.</p>

          <p>Events soon began to escalate. Back at the Robinson family home (located in Reseda,
          California,) Kelly's older sister, Jenny, was driving outside with her friends when 
          they saw a strange unidentified flying object flitting around in the night sky. Again 
          it was a star-like object, quite high in altitude, but obviously not a plane. And when 
          Jenny saw it again, she began to wonder, why were they seeing so many UFOs?</p>

          <p>Soon they would have their answer. In <b>October 1987</b>, Kelly (now age 19,) 
          woke up in her bedroom to find herself surrounded by several gray aliens. "Do not be 
          afraid," they said. "Come with us."</p>

          <p>Kelly was consumed with fear, and protested, explaining that she had a family, a 
          job and bills to pay. The next thing she knew, Kelly found herself inside a small, 
          rounded room with gray walls, laid out on a table. Small figures with large dark eyes, 
          bald heads and grayish skin surrounded her, and told her that they needed to cut her 
          arm. They then told her they needed to do an operation on her brain, and that Kelly 
          would not remember any of this.</p>

          <p>"No," Kelly protested. "I will remember!" And she did. When she woke up the next 
          morning, she immediately looked at her arm and saw a thin, red scar where she had been 
          cut by the grays.</p>

          <p>That was her first encounter, but two weeks later, the grays came back again. This 
          began a series of encounters. During one such event, Kelly was able to converse with 
          the ETs, and they provided her with several predictions about her personal life.</p>

          <p>More strange events began to occur, including a series of weird poltergeist activity.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, Kelly's mother, Diane, woke up to find a strange needle-like mark on her 
          arm. And following one of Kelly's encounters, Diane had a very strange "dream," that 
          she had been taken onboard a UFO and shown weird-looking babies. A human-looking figure 
          entreated Diane to hold and nurture the babies, saying, "they have everything, but they 
          need love."</p>

          <p>This video presents the true story of the Robinson family's series of UFO encounters. 
          What began with a simple sighting eventually escalated into a full-blown series of close
          encounters and onboard UFO experiences. This case reveals one of the main gray agendas 
          to produce hybrid babies. It's a multiple witness case, and shows the patterns that 
          often appear in many other cases of extraterrestrial contact.</p>

          <p>This amazing case was first presented in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">If you had the opportunity to go live with the aliens, would 
          you accept the invitation? Before you answer, consider what happened to a young man 
          named Paul.</p>

          <p>In <b>1978</b>, a group of a half-dozen young men went to a remote cabin in the 
          deserts of Palm Springs, California to enjoy a weekend getaway from the city. During 
          their stay, one of the men, Paul, (age 21) decided to take a late night walk alone 
          through the wilderness. Hours passed and back at the cabin, Paul's friends became 
          worried. Had Paul become lost? Had he hurt himself. They were just getting ready to 
          organize a search party and go look for him when Paul returned to the cabin with an 
          incredible story.</p>

          <p>Paul said that during his walk, he saw an unidentified glowing object drop from 
          the sky and land on the desert floor near the base of a cliff. Paul went to investigate 
          and to his amazement, he saw that the object was a flying saucer, a UFO. And walking 
          around the object were several strange figures.</p>

          <p>Paul gathered up his courage and approached the object. Upon arriving at the site, 
          Paul saw that the figures were not human. They were aliens, extraterrestrials. They 
          were about five feet tall, bald, with large dark eyes, grayish skin, and each of them 
          wore a white jumpsuit. They welcomed Paul and explained that they were studying this 
          location. They invited him onboard their craft, which Paul said was all white inside, 
          very clean and sparsely furnished. Then they asked him a question which sent Paul's 
          mind reeling. "Would you like to come with us?" The only thing was, if he said yes, 
          the decision would be permanent. He could not return.</p>

          <p>This was the story that Paul told his friends. Some of Paul's friends were skeptical 
          of the story, but others believed him. And then, soon something happened which would 
          leave them no choice.</p>

          <p>Paul's story is among the strangest of UFO contact stories, but it is not wholly 
          unique. This video presents the true UFO encounter of Paul, and of two other separate 
          cases involving different men -- all who were apparently invited to live among the ETs. 
          It's something that happens more often than you might think.</p>

          <p>Paul's complete story is told in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Onboard-UFO-Encounters-Accounts-Extraterrestrials/dp/1653842180#:~:text=These%20true%20firsthand%20accounts%20provide,hybrids%2C%20humanoids%20of%20all%20types."

          <h6>Mar 4, 2022 (30:00)</h5>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>2012</b>, Nancy (pseudonym), a single parent from a small 
          town in Indiana, took her 14-year-old son, Anthony, (pseudonym) to the dentist for his 
          annual cleaning, check-up and dental x-rays. Unknown to her, the x-rays showed the presence 
          of a strange unknown object in her son's jaw. They went to the dentist each year, but it 
          wasn't until three years later, in 2015, that they were scheduled for another series of 
          x-rays. On this occasion, the dentist revealed that the x-rays indicated the presence of a 
          metallic FB (foreign body) in her son's jaw, beneath his lower left molar. There was no 
          evidence of any entry wound, and the tooth was healthy, pain-free, and asymptomatic. The 
          dentists were utterly baffled and unable to explain the presence of this mysterious object.</p>

          <p>So began Nancy and Anthony's search for answers. The problem was, there were no explanations, 
          except for one. And the explanation was so outlandish that Nancy wasn't sure if she could accept 
          it. Everywhere she looked, the words "alien implant" kept appearing. When Nancy questioned her 
          son about it, he admitted that he had, in fact, had a close encounter with a UFO. He was also 
          having dreams about aliens.</p>

          <p>Nancy was amazed. She had always known her son was special. As a very young child, 
          he used to see spirits. As he grew, he began to display many powerful psychic abilities, 
          and would daily experience precognition, clairvoyance and incredible synchronicities. 
          And now there was the UFO sighting. Could this all be connected?</p>

          <p>It was shortly before the first x-ray was taken in <b>2012</b>. Anthony and his friend were 
          walking outside at night when a strange cluster of blue and yellow lights appeared in 
          the sky. The lights dropped down low over their heads and began flashing bright colors. 
          He and his friend were both convinced it was a genuine UFO.</p>

          <p>Nancy now found herself obsessed. She needed to know exactly what was happening with 
          her son. Then, on the evening of May 5, 2017, Nancy had an encounter with gray aliens. 
          She watched as one gray stood by the bedroom door, and two other grays began working 
          Anthony. One of the grays told her telepathically that she did not need to worry about 
          her son. "Do not be afraid," he told her. "Everything is okay. We are not here to hurt 
          you. Everything is going to be okay."</p>

          <p>When morning arrived, Nancy told Anthony what happened, and that she felt a huge sense 
          of relief. Both wondered if his apparent alien implant was still there. They were scheduled 
          to have another set of x-rays in a few weeks, so they were eager to see.</p>

          <p>When they arrived at the dentist's office, he took two x-rays. The first one showed that 
          the mysterious object was still there. But the second x-ray, taken about 30 seconds after 
          the first one, showed that the implant had disappeared. Shocked, the dentist took a third 
          x-ray free of charge. To everyone's amazement, the implant was back! One of the dental 
          technicians was so upset by the mystery, she had to leave the room.</p>

          <p>Events were still in progress. Around this time, Nancy began to have recall of her own 
          encounters, reaching back all the way to childhood, when she discovered a mysterious 
          "lump" in her nasal cavity. She also had vivid memories of grays visiting her throughout 
          her life.</p>

          <p>Then, in <b>November of 2018</b>, Nancy was taken onboard a UFO. To her amazement, the 
          interior of the UFO was "dressed up" to look very much like a living room, complete 
          with couch, chair, a TV and cheap carpet. But she was sure she was on a craft, especially 
          after a nine-foot-tall praying mantis ET entered and began to perform a procedure on her 
          and someone else who was also onboard the craft.</p>

          <p>Nancy had no fear. She feels confident that the ETs mean her no harm. And both she and 
          Anthony have accepted the fact that they are UFO contactees. Still, they prefer to keep 
          this aspect of their lives private and have elected to remain anonymous. They just want 
          to live their lives normally.</p>

          <p>Today Nancy and Anthony are moving on with their lives. Anthony is still having daily 
          psychic experiences. But they, like his implant, have become a normal part of his life.</p>

          <p>This video presents the true story of Nancy's and Anthony's encounters with aliens. If 
          you would like to explore more about their amazing experiences, and many others, check out

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1956</b>, ten-year-old Robert Hambly (pseudonym) was 
          enjoying an afternoon of ice-skating with a dozen other children in a local park in the 
          small town of Havre, Montana. Looking up, they were amazed to see several silvery 
          spheres scooting across the sky. Robert had never heard about UFOs and had no idea 
          what he was seeing, but he knew it wasn't normal.</p>

          <p>Only a few days later, Robert's life changed forever. He awoke in the middle of 
          the night to see a strange figure standing next to his bed. To Robert, the figure 
          looked just like a three-foot-tall humanoid cat. It had a large, bald head, huge 
          dark cat-like eyes, and a thin body. Unable to move, Robert was filled with fear. 
          After a short time, the figure vanished. But for the next several years, Robert was 
          visited over and over again.</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, many miles away in Las Vegas, Nevada, a little girl, Melissa Branson, 
          (pseudonym) woke up in her bedroom to see cat-like ETs moving through the wall. She 
          told her parents who said Melissa must have had a nightmare. But Melissa knew better: 
          she had been awake. And when it kept happening, she knew something very strange was 
          happening to her.</p>

          <p>Later, as a teen-ager, Melissa saw a UFO near her home, but still didn't connect it to 
          her childhood visitations.</p>

          <p>Both Melissa and Robert grew up, and many years later, they met, started dating, 
          fell in love and got married. UFOs and aliens were the farthest thing from their 
          minds. But in <b>1992</b>, UFOs came roaring back into their lives. They watched 
          the television miniseries "Intruders," and they realized that they both had very 
          similar experiences with cat-like extraterrestrials. They also discovered that there 
          was a history of UFO encounters on both sides of their families.</p>

          <p>Then came a series of more UFO sightings. It wasn't long after the UFO sightings 
          that, one night, the cat-like ETs returned. Frightened and angry, Robert mentally 
          fought with the ETs, vanquishing them from his life forever.</p>

          <p>Robert and Melissa's case contains unique and interesting elements that provide some 
          important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. Both feel that they were 
          contacted by the same group of ETs who may have even brought them together. Both 
          experienced telepathic contact with the UFOs. Perhaps most important, Robert was 
          able to end his encounters by ordering the ETs to leave him alone. Their case is 
          an important addition to our understanding of the extraterrestrial presence on our 
          planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Born in <b>1960</b>, Jill Wheeler (pseudonym) had her first 
          UFO encounter when she was only five years old. A group of three-foot-tall figures 
          dressed up like teddy bears entered her home and told her to follow them. A closer 
          look revealed them to be typical grays. A short conversation ensued, at which point 
          the ETs brought out a mysterious black box and set it up in the middle of her bedroom. 
          A strange procedure followed, and after a little while, the grays left. That was Jill's 
          first experience. But it wouldn't be her last.</p>

          <p>Around age nine, the grays returned, and began to teach Jill secret lessons. 
          Unfortunately, Jill couldn't remember what they taught her. The grays returned a 
          few days later and shared more information with her. And over the next three years, 
          they visited more than 100 times, always with the purpose of teaching Jill secret 
          knowledge. The visits were always pleasant and fun, and Jill looked forward to them. 
          In fact, the ETs showed her how to call them down using a special signal. Then, after 
          three years, the encounters abruptly ended. And as the grays had warned her, she forgot 
          about them completely.</p>

          <p>A short time later, Jill and her best friend had a dramatic close-up sighting of a 
          huge metallic craft. It was an encounter that would convince her that UFOs were real.</p>

          <p>After that, Jill's life returned to normal. She grew up, got married. She and her 
          husband bought a home in a small town in Nebraska. She got pregnant with her first 
          child, and shortly later had another kid. But it was shortly after she gave birth to 
          her third child that weird experiences began to occur.</p>

          <p>She had been diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child, and she had to have annual lung 
          x-rays to monitor her condition. One year, Jill went to the doctor, and they discovered 
          a strange unidentified object in her lungs. Doctors were unable to explain it.</p>

          <p>More weirdness followed. Jill was changing her new baby's diaper when a tiny object 
          fell out her nose. She instantly saw that this object wasn't natural. It was white and 
          looked like a miniature spool. But what was it doing in her nose?</p>

          <p>Following this event, Jill's health began to decline. She felt sick and dizzy, and 
          rapidly lost weight. Her health slowly spiraled downward, and after three years, Jill 
          was extremely weak, and was passing out multiple times daily. Doctors were unable to 
          diagnose her condition. All they knew was that Jill was very sick.</p>

          <p>Then, <b>one evening in 1995</b>, Jill was walking across her living room when suddenly 
          she found herself inside what appeared to be a huge underground base. There was a domed 
          ceiling, hundreds of small cubicles, and Jill was inside one of them lying on a cold, 
          steel doctor's table. She was dazed and disoriented, and like other people who were there, 
          was trying to figure out where she was.</p>

          <p>Suddenly, a strange nine-foot-tall humanoid entered her cubicle and said, "Okay, it's 
          your turn now, Jill." Jill screamed in terror as the being began a mysterious medical 
          procedure on her body.</p>

          <p>During the procedure, Jill lost consciousness, and the next thing she knew, she was 
          back in her home. Only now, her family would not wake up. It took her more than twenty 
          minutes of shaking them before any of them would wake up.</p>

          <p>Jill had no idea what had happened to her. But that evening, as she put her infant son 
          to bed, he pointed at the moon and said, "Mommy! I went on a ship to the moon! Went on a 
          ship to the moon!"</p>

          <p>Jill was shocked. Had her son been taken too? Even stranger, Jill noticed that although 
          her body was very sore (a condition which persisted for two weeks,) she was feeling much 
          better. In fact, the next day, she didn't lose consciousness at all. And as the days passed, 
          she never passed out again, and she began to gain her weight back. Had the ETs healed her? 
          And if so, why her? She was just a housewife from Nebraska.</p>

          <p>Not long after that, Jill had another close-up sighting of a UFO that paced her car. 
          And after that, she was taken again inside a UFO. This time she was shown a little baby 
          who didn't quite look human. The ETs told her, "This is your baby."</p>

          <p>Jill could ignore it no longer. She began doing research about her experiences and 
          learned that she was a UFO contactee. But still she wondered, why her? And who was 
          that nine-foot-tall alien? Had she really been taken to an underground base? Was that
          weird-looking baby truly hers? She still has many questions. And these are only some 
          of the many strange encounters she had experienced.</p>

          <p>This video presents the lifelong UFO encounters of Jill Wheeler, and is surely one 
          of the strangest and most bizarre contact cases on record. To hear more about Jill's

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">According to The Center for Disease Control and The World 
          Health Organization, the leading cause of death in the world is heart disease. In 
          fact, about one in four deaths are attributable to some form of heart disease. Since 
          physical healings are a consistent feature of UFO encounters, it should come as no 
          surprise that there are many cases of people who have been healed of heart disease by 
          extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than a dozen cases of people healed of various heart 
          conditions. The cases reach back decades and are still occurring today. Men, women 
          and children all over the world are being visited and healed.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A young girl from California has an ET dream and wakes up to find herself healed 
              of an enlarged heart.</li>
            <li>A man from Russia is invited aboard a UFO and is healed of a chronic heart condition 
              by tall human-looking aliens.</li>
            <li>A man born with a hole in his heart receives numerous psychic healings from a gray 
              alien by the name of Mazu.</li>
            <li>A man from Puerto Rico is visited by three short humanoids who tell him is sick, 
              and quickly proceed to heal him of heart disease.</li>
            <li>A woman from Ukraine dying from heart disease is visited in her hospital room by a 
              glowing entity who heals her using orbs of light.</li>
            <li>A real-estate agent from Oregon is struck by lightning, then abducted by grays who 
              tell her that her heart has been damaged, and they will fix it.</li>
            <li>A professor from Pennsylvania is visiting the Isle of Iona, is struck by a beam of 
              light and experiences missing time. Later hypnotized by Dr. John Mack MD, he recalls 
              being healed by a short reptilian humanoid of arterial sclerosis.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These are just a few of the many cases of people who claim to have been healed by 
          extraterrestrials of a wide variety of heart conditions. These accounts show a benevolent 
          side of UFO contact that is often ignored. They show that healing humanity is a primary 
          ET agenda. They also show just how truly advanced the ETs are.</p>

          <h5>Feb 4, 2022 (0:24:02)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Located in southern California, the Los Angeles International 
          Airport (LAX) is the third busiest airport in the world. Millions of people from all 
          across the planet travel to and from the airport each year. But it's not only people 
          who are visiting LAX, aliens are too! UFOs are being seen here in large numbers!</p>

          <p>In fact, airports all over the world are being targeted by UFOs. For some reason, 
          the ETs are attracted to airports. And more than any other airport, LAX is a UFO 
          magnet. There are at least a dozen cases of UFOs hovering over Los Angeles International 
          Airport. These cases began in the <b>early 1950s</b> and are continuing to the present 
          day. These are not distant sightings of unexplained lights in the sky, but often 
          structured metallic craft seen at low elevation for long periods of time.</p>

          <p>Metallic discs, cigar-shaped craft, triangular craft, spherical craft, all have been 
          seen directly over LAX. Many of these are daylight sightings. They not only move 
          directly over the airport; they display fantastic maneuvers and will even hover in 
          place within full view of the airport control tower.</p>

          <p>LAX is located in a densely populated urban area. Many of these sightings involve 
          large numbers of witnesses. These UFOs have been viewed by air-traffic controllers, 
          pilots, baggage handlers, airport employees and numerous other people who live 
          nearby. The objects have been caught on radar and even photographed. The cases 
          themselves occur with incredible regularity and have often made newspaper and 
          television headlines. Due to the brazen behavior of these objects, it is clear 
          that they want to be seen and are intentionally showing themselves to people. The 
          question is, why? Is there an agenda behind these sightings? Are ETs putting on a 
          display to announce their presence? Why is it that LAX is such a powerful magnet 
          of UFO activity?</p>

          <p>This video presents a decades-long chronology of the UFO activity over one of the 
          busiest airports on the planet, and it also reveals interesting insights about UFO 
          behavior. The UFO activity over LAX is so intense that it proves that UFOs do, in 
          fact, have an agenda to show themselves, apparently to convince people of the existence 
          of UFOs.</p>

          <h5>Jan 28, 2022 (0:52:08)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1984</b>, 24-year-old Don Anderson of Spanish Fork, 
          Utah woke up to see a gray alien inside his bedroom, taking away his 4-year-old son. 
          Don leaped out of bed and informed the gray that if they were going to take his son, 
          he wanted to join them. The gray agreed. Both Don and his son were taken onboard a 
          craft where they were greeted by a female human-looking ET who gave them a tour of 
          the craft. The ET informed Don of several events which would soon occur in his personal 
          life. Don and his son were then returned.</p>

          <p>This event caused a radical shift in Don's life. He recognized the gray as a friend 
          and teacher, and he remembered having encountered him before. In fact, several bizarre 
          events which Don had ignored, denied or explained away now suddenly made sense, and he 
          realized he had been experiencing UFO contact his entire life. He remembered being 
          visited and taken as a young boy. He remembered seeing a UFO and the gray at age ten, 
          then being taken onboard a craft and taught how to perform telekinesis and about the 
          aliens' technology. A missing time event at age fourteen now revealed itself to be an 
          extensive onboard UFO encounter during which he was again taken beyond Earth and taught 
          by the ETs. He even remembered a "pre-life" encounter during which his gray alien guide 
          showed Don's mother giving birth to him!</p>

          <p>Don, who had been religious, now realized that he was in contact with extraterrestrials. 
          This began a lifelong search for answers. He also began experiencing a wide variety of 
          paranormal events including precognition, out-of-body experiences, communication with 
          spirits and more. And of course, more UFO encounters.</p>

          <p>He once went camping with some friends (also UFO contactees) not far from the famous 
          Skinwalker Ranch, hoping to initiate contact with praying mantis ETs. To the amazement of 
          Don and his friends, a huge UFO showed up, followed by several mantis ETs. This culminated 
          in a long and profound onboard encounter during which Don communicated with the praying 
          mantis aliens who again gave him information about his personal life and showed him many 
          strange and wonderful things onboard the craft.</p>

          <p>It wasn't long before more encounters occurred. On one occasion, Don was visited by a 
          familiar human-looking ET who cured him of a chest cold. On another occasion he was taken 
          onboard and treated for a heart problem.</p>

          <p>Don's encounters attracted the attention of the U.S. military who threatened him not 
          to talk about his experiences. As a result, Don decided to go public. He spoke at 
          conventions and began doing interviews and writing about his experiences. He even put 
          together a website called "Path of Shaballa" (link below) to share the spiritual 
          information he learned at the hands of the ETs. Shaballa can be translated as "Wisdom of 
          the Ancient Ones."</p>
          
          <p>Don's case is more extensive than most. He has worked hard to understand his encounters, 
          learn from them, and share the wisdom he has been given. He says that while people are 
          very interested in the physical aspects of his encounters, it is the spiritual information 
          that is the most important and is the reason he decided to go public.</p>
          
          <p>Don's full story is told in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">The state of Arizona has played a powerful role in shaping 
          our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. In fact, many of the world's most influential 
          UFO cases have taken place here. Sightings, UFO waves, hot-spots, radar cases, UFO 
          landings, photographic cases, face-to-face encounters, onboard UFO experiences, 
          government cover-ups, UFO crash/retrievals -- Arizona has them all.</p>

          <p>Part One of this two-part episode presented a countdown of the top twenty cases from 
          number twenty down to number eleven. Now, in Part Two, we countdown Arizona's top ten 
          best cases. These are the cases that have defined the UFO phenomenon. Some of them have 
          garnered national headlines, and others are not well-known but deserve to be placed in 
          the annals of UFO history. The time for skepticism is over. We must now face the fact 
          that UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are visiting our planet, and these are the cases 
          that prove it.</p>

          <p>These cases, and hundreds of others, are all featured in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">While UFO encounters occur all across the planet, some places 
          are more active than others. One such location is the state of Arizona. In fact, the 
          Grand Canyon state has produced some of the world's most famous and influential encounters.</p>

          <p>After reviewing thousands of UFO cases from Arizona, I have compiled a list of what 
          I think are the top twenty best cases in the state. These cases include well-known 
          influential cases, cases of high credibility, cases that contain unique or unusual 
          elements, cases that provide important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon,

          <h5>Jan 7, 2022 (0:35:51)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">This is the true story of "Lisa," a daycare worker from 
          northern California who has had lifelong contacts with extraterrestrials. Lisa is 
          not her real name. Although she did go public with her encounters, she now prefers 
          to remain private. Lisa's encounters began in <b>1972</b>, around age 5, when she 
          was approached by a tall praying mantis alien while in her backyard. Next thing she 
          knew, an hour had passed, and she was being returned to her home. Following this, 
          her encounters occurred regularly, almost always involving praying mantis-type ETs.</p>

          <p>Her next major encounter occurred at age 14, while scuba diving on Catalina Island 
          in southern California. She was abducted into a UFO and underwent what appears to be 
          the extraction of a hybrid-baby fetus from her womb. It was a terrifying experience 
          and left her both physically sore and emotionally shaken.</p>

          <p>Then, one <b>evening in November of 1992</b>, Lisa was driving with a friend along 
          the 101 Ventura Freeway outside of Los Angeles, California when a UFO swooped down and 
          began to pace their car. Without warning, it sent down a beam of light, striking their 
          vehicle. Time seemed to stop as the two women were pulled from the car, up the beam of 
          light and into the craft. So began one of the most extensive encounters of Lisa's life.</p>

          <p>Onboard, Lisa and her friend were separated. Lisa saw her friend being shown star 
          maps, while Lisa herself was taken to another room, undressed and given a physical 
          examination. The ETs told her not to be afraid, that she was a part of their project, 
          and they had to do this.</p>

          <p>Following the exam, Lisa was shown what appears to be the engine room or the power 
          source of the craft. She was then given a long and very personal message containing 
          details of her private life, and she was told several prophecies and predictions 
          which the ETs told her would later occur. And as the ETs predicted, these events did 
          in fact happen. Finally, the two women were reunited on the craft and sent back to 
          their car via a levitating beam of light.</p>

          <p>More encounters would soon occur. Two years later, in <b>1994</b>, Lisa became a 
          participant in a mass UFO abduction event on Coronado Island in California. Up to a 
          dozen people experienced a visitation on the same night. It would be the first time 
          Lisa encountered gray aliens.</p>

          <p>Lisa's encounters are too numerous to count. She's been taken onboard many times. 
          Often she is handed hybrid babies, half-human, half-alien and told to love and nurture 
          them while the aliens observe.</p>

          <p>Lisa's case involves physical evidence of various kinds. She has had numerous 
          unexplained nosebleeds, strange marks on her body, a possible implant and more. While 
          many details of her encounters were recalled under hypnosis, Lisa is one of a small 
          portion of contactees who are able to remember their experiences without hypnosis. 
          Her story is one of great personal struggle and triumph. It's a story that has much 
          to reveal about what it's like to have ET contact, and the ET agenda on our planet.</p>
          
          <p>If you'd like to explore more about Lisa's experiences, her account is told in my

          <h5>Dec 31, 2021 (0:36:11)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On <b>April 22, 1994</b>, in the middle of the night, 
          former Navy officer and postal worker Bill Shellhart was driving along a desert 
          highway in New Mexico when he saw strange glowing lights ahead of him on the road. 
          As the lights approached him, Bill realized he was seeing an actual flying saucer. It 
          hovered above his car flashing down beams of light. Terrified, Bill raced away down the 
          highway. Little did he know, his encounter had only just begun.</p>
          
          <p>Looking around him, he noticed that the landscape around him had mysteriously 
          transformed from flat desert to mountains covered with trees. And looking ahead of 
          him on the road, he was shocked to see a massive roiling cloud-like mass sweeping 
          towards his car. The weird cloud engulfed him, and the next thing Bill knew, he was 
          many miles from his original location.</p>
          
          <p>This was Bill's first encounter, but it would not be his last. This missing time 
          encounter was followed by a series of sightings and close encounters. One year later, 
          a UFO paced his car along a remote desert highway. He began seeing UFOs over his home 
          in Hawaii. He woke up one evening to find a brilliant light filling his bedroom. He 
          would wake up to find strange triangular marks on his body. He noticed that some of 
          his chronic medical problems were miraculously healed.</p>
          
          <p>Meanwhile, Bill's wife, Rose, revealed that she had also had UFO encounters. As a 
          young girl, she was mysteriously rescued from drowning. In <b>1977</b>, she had a very 
          close-up sighting of a metallic domed saucer with portholes and colored lights which 
          sent down a beam of light, burning the grass near her home in Pasadena, California. 
          She later met Bill and they fell in love and became married. Rose reports that she'd 
          often wake up in the early morning hours when her husband would be dropped back in bed. 
          Bill would then tell her about his strange dream-like experiences of being onboard a 
          craft where he was taught by the ETs.</p>
          
          <p>Then, in the <b>mid 1990s</b>, Bill and Rose were vacationing in Sedona, Arizona. 
          Driving along a highway late at night, they were followed by a mysterious glowing 
          light. For the next half-hour, the light circled around their car, getting closer and 
          closer. Without warning, it dropped from the sky and landed in a field alongside the 
          road. The next thing Bill and Rose knew, hours had passed, and they were approaching 
          their hotel.</p>
          
          <p>Realizing they had experienced another missing time encounter, they decided to go 
          under hypnosis. They learned that they had not been abducted, but instead they had 
          been invited onboard a craft where they met friendly human-looking ETs who had an 
          important message for them.</p>
          
          <p>The UFO encounters of Bill and Rose continued, and both became spiritually transformed. 
          They look upon the ETs as friends and teachers, and they have agreed to share their 
          experiences with the world.</p>

          <p>The full story of the UFOs of Bill and Rose (and several other accounts) is

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On <b>June 15, 1965</b>, fourteen-year-old Ron C. of New 
          Kensington, Pennsylvania spent the afternoon skateboarding with his two friends. At 
          <b>7:00pm</b>, they had just returned to Ron's home when a huge flying saucer appeared 
          overhead. All three boys stared upward in amazement as a window opened in the craft, 
          revealing the silhouettes of two human-looking figures gazing down at them. Other 
          people around town had recently reported seeing UFOs, and now Ron realized that he 
          and his friends were seeing an actual alien craft.</p>
          
          <p>Ron was overcome with awe, and he thought to himself, how wonderful it would be if 
          he could take a ride onboard the UFO. He lifted his arms and began waving at the UFO 
          people, mentally asking them if they would take him onboard.</p>
          
          <p>So began an adventure that would affect Ron for the rest of his life. His benevolent 
          experience with human-looking extraterrestrials was his first and most profound 
          encounter, but it would be followed by many other sightings. As he grew up, got 
          married and had children, his entire family would become involved.</p>
          
          <p>Ron's onboard UFO encounter lasted three full hours. And although he doesn't remember 
          everything that happened, he remembers enough to provide him with some interesting and 
          unusual insights into the nature of UFOs and the people who pilot them. According to Ron, 
          humanity will be experiencing some profound and world-shaking revelations that will 
          forever change how everybody thinks about the UFO phenomenon.</p>
          
          <p>Ron's account is one of fifteen cases presented in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO encounters are known for their high strangeness. While 
          cases of alien contact do have many similarities, each case is also unique, and 
          sometimes contains bizarre and unusual details never reported before. One such case 
          of very high strangeness comes from a gentleman by the name of James Santiago.</p>
          
          <p>James Santiago was a popular and successful nightclub performer. In <b>1982</b>, 
          James and a friend, a world-famous artist named Cleo Jensen (pseudonym,) began a 
          two-day-long road-trip through the Canadian Rockies. What James didn't know is that 
          Cleo was a UFO contactee. Shortly after their trip began, Cleo revealed her secret 
          and told James that she was being followed by UFOs, and that she had been having ET 
          contact her whole life.</p>
          
          <p>James had never given much thought to UFOs, and he wasn't sure what to think about 
          his friend's strange announcement. And then, while in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, 
          Cleo announced that a UFO was coming, and they were about to have an extraterrestrial 
          encounter.</p>
          
          <p>So began one of the strangest events in James's life. A glowing green flying saucer 
          appeared and began to pace their vehicle. And then events went from strange to bizarre, 
          forever altering the course of James's life. The first encounter was followed by several 
          others, one after another, leaving James with a whole new awareness, not only of 
          humanity's place in the universe, but of his own life. James began to look at other 
          unexplained events in his life, from childhood onwards, and realized that he himself 
          was very likely a UFO contactee.</p>
          
          <p>This unique account of UFO contact reveals some interesting and profound insights 
          into the nature of the UFO phenomenon, and it shows just how bizarre and strange UFO 
          contact can be.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are seen all across our planet. The same is true for 
          extraterrestrials. In fact, ETs are sometimes seen in locations you'd least expect. It 
          may sound incredible, but the truth is, people are seeing ETs in public, walking among 
          the general population. And it's not just a few cases. There are a lot of them.</p>
          
          <p>Convenience stores, schools, bookshops, restaurants, theaters, churches, buses, subways, 
          casinos, gas-stations, hotel lobbies, train stations and more -- no place is off limits. 
          These reports include a wide variety of grays and strange humanoids.</p>
          
          <p>How can this happen? Have ETs infiltrated our society? What are they doing? Why are 
          they here?  Cases like these raise all kinds of questions!</p>
          
          <p>This video presents nearly 20 different cases of ETs mingling in public places. The 
          cases show some startling similarities and provide some important insights into the UFO 
          phenomenon. You may have seen an ET and not even know it!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Many people all across the world are having lifelong contacts 
          with UFOs and extraterrestrials. However, some cases are more extensive than others. One 
          such case comes from a gentleman named Tim. Born in Louisiana, Tim has worked as a police 
          officer, security guard, sports instructor and more. His UFO contacts began around age 
          six with a dramatic UFO sighting in front of his home. Following that, he had a series 
          of sightings, missing time events, face-to-face contact, and onboard UFO encounters.</p>
          
          <p>While Tim's contacts were initially shrouded in missing time (he once was missing 
          for more than an entire day!) -- he began to have dreams and flashbacks of what had 
          happened to him. Some of Tim's experiences are highly unusual and a few might be unique. 
          On one occasion, Tim remembers waking up onboard a UFO, and wandering around until 
          suddenly he came upon a gray alien. Consumed with fear, Tim reached back and punched 
          the gray in the head. At that point, a crowd of ETs converged upon him. On another 
          occasion, he was taken to the control room and was taught by the ETs how to fly the 
          craft. He even has some insights into how the UFO engines actually work. One of his 
          most unusual experiences is being taken to a "waiting room" with other abductees where 
          they are able to levitate at will. These are a just a few of Tim's many encounters.</p>
          
          <p>Tim's story has multiple witnesses and physiological evidence in support of his case.

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs and extraterrestrials have been around for thousands 
          of years. The evidence shows that they have been with us since recorded history. 
          Clearly, they are very interested in us.</p>

          <p>What is our relationship with the ETs, and particularly, the grays? Could they 
          be our ancestors? Are they time travelers from the future? Have they intervened in 
          humanity's evolution? Why do virtually all reports of aliens involve humanoids? 
          And what about the fact that some ETs look just like us? There are many questions 
          and mysteries surrounding UFOs and our relationship with them.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents more than a dozen cases from across the world in which the 
          ETs have provided information and answers to these questions. These cases show that 
          our relationship with the ETs might be much closer than many people realize. We are 
          not alone in the universe. And as these cases will show, the separation between "us" 
          and "them" might be an illusion. We are all one!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Born in New York, Tony Ditata had his first UFO sighting at age 
          seventeen, while walking outside his home in Brentwood. A few years later, he experienced 
          a dramatic face-to-face encounter with a gray alien on the local golf course. Before long, 
          he started having memories of being taken onboard a craft. Soon more encounters followed: 
          sightings, missing-time, onboard experiences and more face-to-face encounters. When Tony 
          realized finally accepted that he was a UFO abductee, he sought regressive hypnosis and 
          recalled an incredible experience where he and his girlfriend were taken onboard a massive 
          disc which had landed alongside the road in upstate New York.</p>
          
          <p>Tony's encounters span the gamut of the UFO experience, with virtually every type of 
          encounter, some of which are extremely bizarre. At one point, he was able to meet with who 
          he believes is his hybrid-ET daughter, or as he calls her, his "Star Daughter." Along with 
          the UFO encounters came various paranormal experiences, such as poltergeist encounters, 
          past life memories and more.</p>
          
          <p>Tony's encounters have left him profoundly changed, and have left him a whole new view 
          of life on Earth and beyond. His story provides a fascinating glimpse into the life of a 
          contactee.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents Tony's story in his own words. You will hear his story firsthand as 
          he describes his encounters, and how they have affected him and altered the course of his 
          life.</p>

          VISITATIONS<br>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Where is the most likely place to see an extraterrestrial? As 
          strange as it may sound, one of the most commonly reported encounters is known as a 
          "bedroom visitation." In case after case, people report waking up at night to find gray 
          aliens in their bedroom. For many witnesses, a bedroom visitation is the experience that 
          wakes them up to the realization that they are having lifelong encounters with 
          extraterrestrials.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents three different cases of people who experienced a bedroom visitation 
          by gray aliens. Each is unique, not only in content, but in how the witnesses react.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE ONE "Connie"</b> is visited in her third story apartment bedroom in Washington 
          State by silver-suited grays, causing a huge transformation, physically, mentally and 
          spiritually.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO: "Madison"</b> had seen UFOs before, but had no idea that she was in actual 
          contact until she was visited by grays in the bedroom of her apartment in White Plains, 
          New York. Only then did she examine her past and realize that she had been having contact 
          her entire life.</p>
          
          <p><b>CASE THREE "Evelyn"</b> had never thought much about UFOs until she woke up in her 
          bedroom to see several grays who told her that they were on a mission. Evelyn felt no 
          fear, and would later have more encounters during which she received urgent messages for 
          all humankind.</p>
          
          <p>Bedroom visitations are far more common than most people realize. It doesn't matter if 
          you live in the country or in the heart of a crowded city, the ETs can find you. These 
          three cases have volumes to reveal about the ET agenda, what it's like to have a bedroom 
          visitation, and the incredible after-effects of contact.</p>

          <h5>Nov 5, 2021 (0:30:08)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are several very famous incidents involving Schoolyard 
          UFO Encounters. The Ariel Elementary School Incident in Ruwa, Zimbabwe; the Westall 
          High School Incident in Melbourne, Australia; the Broadhaven Elementary School Incident 
          in Wales; the Crestview Elementary School incident in Opa-Locka, Florida; and the 
          Hillsdale College incident, in Hillsdale, Michigan (to name a few!) But what many 
          people don't know is that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg. There are 
          well over 100 documented cases of UFOs hovering over schools. Not only hovering, 
          but in about 1/3 of the cases, the UFOs land and/or humanoids are seen.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents two incredible cases, both which occurred in <b>May of 1977</b>, 
          separated by four days and less than 100 miles. Unlike the above cases, these received 
          zero publicity, and were very nearly lost to history. In this video, you will hear the 
          testimony from the fathers of two young schoolgirls who were firsthand witnesses to a 
          Schoolyard UFO Encounter.</p>
          
          <p>The first case took place on <b>May 2, 1977</b>, at an un-named elementary school 
          in Downey, California. The case involves a very low-level sighting, has multiple 
          witnesses and some very unusual effects. The second case took place on <b>May 6, 1977</b> 
          at Ocean Knoll Elementary school. It involves humanoids and an apparent landing.</p>
          
          <p>Schoolyard UFO Encounters have been occurring since at least <b>1950</b>, and 
          are still occurring today. These are not normal sightings. Unlike your average 
          encounter, these cases are almost exclusively daylight encounters, very low level, 
          long-lasting and involve many, many witnesses. ETs are targeting schools in an 
          apparent agenda to announce their presence to the world in a very subtle way. The 
          question is, why?</p>

        <article>
          <!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
          <h5>Oct 29, 2021 (1:01:10)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Although UFO abduction cases number in the thousands (or in 
          the millions according to some researchers!) there is an almost complete lack of cases 
          observed by outside witnesses. UFOs are almost never caught in the act of abducting 
          someone. How is this possible? How can so many abductions go completely unseen?</p>
          
          <p>This scarcity of outside witnesses has caused some researchers to speculate that 
          UFO abductions may be mental events with no basis in physical reality. However most 
          UFO investigators are well aware of why there are so few witnesses. The main reasons 
          seem to be that outside observers are put in a trance, made to forget, or are diverted 
          to other locations. In other words, the mysterious absence of outside witnesses is 
          apparently no accident.</p>
          
          <p>But nobody's perfect, not even ETs. Surely there must be some cases where somebody 
          saw an abduction take place. And as a matter of fact, there are cases of observed 
          abductions. But they are shockingly rare, so uncommon as to be almost statistically 
          insignificant. But they do happen.</p>
          
          <p>This video presents twenty cases in which ETs have been caught in the act of 
          abducting someone. These accounts show that sometimes, on very rare occasions, 
          outside observers are put in a position to witness events that almost nobody else 
          gets to see.</p>
          
          <p>These cases raise many questions. How and why do so many abductions go unobserved? 
          Is the fact that some are observed an accident or is it intentional? What do these 
          cases tell us about the nature of the UFO phenomenon and how advanced the ETs actually 
          are?</p>
          
          <p>The cases presented here will hopefully provide some insights and answers to these 
          many questions. If you would like to explore more about cases of observed abductions, 
          you might be interested in my book,

          <h5>Oct 22, 2021 (0:56:30)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Deep underwater, a few miles off the coast of Malibu, California, 
          lies a massive and mysterious stone structure. With a large flat top and what appears to be 
          giant columns and an entrance into a dark tunnel, the "Malibu Anomaly" has become famous 
          across the world. Some say that it's a natural geological formation, while others believe 
          it's an undersea UFO base. Which is the truth?</p>
          
          <p>Natural or artificial, the structure is located in the center of a well-known UFO 
          hotspot known as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro Channel. More than 150 documented cases 
          of UFOs and "USOs" (unidentified submersible objects,) surround the area. Reports reach 
          back more than 100 years and are still continuing to the present day.</p>
          
          <p>How old is this formation? If it is a construction, then who built it and why? Is the 
          government aware of it? Could it actually be an undersea UFO base? Is it evidence of 
          ancient aliens? Its unusual appearance, and the fact that there are so many UFO and USO 
          reports lend credence to this theory. However, skeptics point out that there is no hard 
          evidence proving that this structure is, in fact, made by extraterrestrials.</p>
          
          <p>In this video, we take a deep dive into all the known evidence, and objectively 
          examine everything that has been learned about this extraordinary structure known as 
          the Malibu Anomaly. We will look at the distribution of the UFO and USO accounts in 
          this area. We will hear of reports from UFO experiencers who may have actually been 
          taken inside the base. We will hear theories and conclusions from scientists and 
          ufologists who conducted firsthand investigations, including sending down an unmanned 
          submersible to take a close-up look at the structure. We will examine this structure 
          from every angle and see if we can come up with answers to the many mysteries 
          surrounding the Malibu Anomaly.</p>

          about 1 in 50,000. And yet, each year approximately 2000 people are killed by lightning 
          strikes. Many more people suffer severe injuries. However, very rarely, something 
          strange and miraculous happens: people are actually healed. As strange as this sounds, 
          lightning has actually cured people of a wide variety of illnesses and diseases.</p>
          
          <p>Being cured by lightning may sound like science fiction, but it's actually very well 
          documented. Cases reach back all the way to the 1700s and are still occurring today. 
          Men, women and children all across the planet have reported these healings, many of 
          which are verified by doctors. People have been cured of paralysis, cancer, blindness, 
          deafness, rheumatism,  typhoid fever, asthma, muscular dystrophy and more. There are 
          even a few cases involving animals! What is it about lightning that is causing people to 
          be healed?</p>
          
          <p>Lightning has some very interesting properties. It is extremely hot (3 times hotter 
          than the surface of the sun.) It is also highly magnetic. People are not only healed by 
          lightning, they are sometimes levitated off the ground.</p>
          
          <p>Some of these effects are shockingly similar to beams of lights from UFOs. In fact, 
          there are now more than 300 documented cases of UFO healings. Many of the UFO healings 
          are done using beams of light. UFO beams are also known to burn people, levitate them, 
          cause temporary paralysis and more. Have the ETs learned how to harness the mysterious 
          properties of lightning? One thing is certain, they know more about the electromagnetic 
          spectrum than we do.</p>
          
          <p>What is it like to be healed by lightning? How do these cases take place? What do 
          they have to teach us about the power of light?</p>
          
          <p>This video presents more than 30 cases of people who have been healed as the result 
          of a lightning strike. These cases reveal a mysterious and powerful aspect of light that 
          we have yet to understand.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Is there a government coverup of UFOs? The answer appears to 
          be a resounding yes. Judging from the countless blacked-out documents released through 
          the Freedom of Information Act from multiple intelligence agencies, the public is not 
          being told the whole truth about the UFO phenomenon. This fact is further corroborated 
          by the many government whistleblowers who have stepped forward and revealed their own 
          participation in secret UFO projects.</p>

          <p>Now a new whistleblower and government UFO insider has decided it's time to tell his 
          story. "Thomas," a retired Navy officer, is now ready to let the world know about his 
          own experiences. Thomas held a secret clearance in the Navy, but after retiring, was 
          contacted by a Pentagon officer and was invited into the inner sanctum of the secret 
          government working with UFO crash/retrievals. Thomas learned shocking details that would 
          leave him forever changed. This video tells the story of what Thomas learned about what 
          is really going on within the United States government, and their interest in UFOs and 
          aliens. Crashed UFOs being held at military bases. ETs working along with the military. 
          An underground city at Area 51. The truth is finally coming out!</p>

          <h5>Oct 1, 2021 (0:54:43)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A vast number of people have experienced direct contact with 
          UFOs and extraterrestrials. However, for some people, this contact is more extensive than 
          most. One of these individuals is a man by the name of Taylor Foster. A chiropractor from 
          Missouri, Taylor has experienced UFO encounters for his entire life. His first dramatic 
          encounter occurred at age 11 when a UFO hovered over him, sent down a beam of light and 
          caused missing time. In the days that followed, Taylor began to remember what had happened 
          during this period of amnesia. He met beautiful human-looking aliens who held a long 
          philosophical conversation with him.</p>

          <p>Following this incredible event, Taylor's life changed dramatically. His intelligence 
          and awareness increased profoundly, and his UFO encounters began to occur at a fast and 
          furious rate. He began having more missing time encounters and face-to-face meetings with 
          gray-type ETs. His experiences continued, and he soon had literally hundreds of sightings 
          and many much closer encounters.</p>

          <p>Before long, Taylor started having fully conscious encounters, and was able to converse 
          with the grays, who taught him various things, such as how they are able to carry humans 
          in their craft while darting around and moving at high speeds, or how they are able to move 
          through solid walls. They told him about implants and more.</p>

          <p>Taylor has not felt any fear during his encounters, and instead feels that the ETs 
          are his friends, or even family. He has developed a strong and close relationship with 
          them, and his encounters continue to this day.</p>

          <p>This video presents the incredible story of Taylor Foster's lifelong encounters with 
          UFOs and extraterrestrials, and provides many insights into the nature and origins of 
          the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">When somebody has a close encounter and are taken onboard a 
          UFO, it is not unusual for them to return with strange markings on their body. Often 
          this may take the form of a scoop mark, bruises, or puncture marks. Much more rare are 
          weird alien symbols. And yet, over and over again, people who meet extraterrestrials 
          and have an onboard encounter are left with an unexplained alien symbol somewhere on 
          their body.</p>

          <p>These symbols can be simple, such as the shape of a triangle, or more complex, such 
          as foreign-looking letters, hieroglyphic-like designs, or weird symbolic patterns of 
          obviously intelligent design.</p>

          <p>This video presents several cases of abductees and experiencers who have returned 
          from their encounters bearing these alien symbols on their skin. One of the cases 
          presented here is among the strangest on record. There are now enough cases now to 
          make it clear that something very profound is happening here.</p>

          <p>What do these symbols mean? Are they the result of an extraterrestrial medical 
          procedure? Could this be a symptom of an alien implant? Are ETs tagging humans like 
          we do to animals? Are they tattooing people with an alien symbol for tracking 
          purposes? Are they calling cards, proof for the witness that something unusual has 
          happened to them?</p>

          <p>These are questions which hopefully some of these cases will be able to answer!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Most UFO encounters are simple sightings. Sometimes, however, 
          UFOs get very close. In these cases, what starts out as a sighting transforms into 
          face-to-face contact with the unknown. Accounts like these provide far more information 
          than just a sighting.</p>

          <p>This video presents three cases of very close encounters with UFOs. When UFOs get this 
          close, there is virtually no possibility of misidentification.</p>

          <p><b>Case One</b>: Three children are walking near their home in Mount Olive, Louisiana 
          when a UFO drops down from the sky, hovers twenty feet over their heads, and strikes them 
          with a beam of light.</p>

          <p><b<Case Two</b>: Four teenagers drive up a winding dirt road into the mountains of San 
          Dimas, California and are confronted by a gigantic UFO which has landed in a field. 
          Surrounding the craft are several strange figures, one of whom approaches them.</p>

          <p><b>Case Three</b>: Two young friends sitting outside a library in Koreatown, California 
          watch as a saucer-shaped craft drops down from the sky and hovers over the powerlines. The 
          mother of one of the girls arrives to drive them home, and the UFO follows them over their 
          car, beginning an ordeal that they will remember for the rest of their lives.</p>

          <p>These three cases of very close encounters show how quickly a sighting can become 
          something much more complicated. Each of these unique and fascinating accounts has 
          something profound to teach us about UFOs and these strange extraterrestrial visitors 
          to our planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">People from all walks of life have UFO encounters, and that 
          includes celebrities. In fact, more and more famous people are now stepping forward to 
          reveal their own sightings, or in some cases, actual face-to-face contact with 
          extraterrestrials. Actors, singers, sports stars -- a huge number of superstars have 
          had dramatic encounters with UFOs and aliens.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than 70 celebrity UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, UFO 
          photographs, face-to-face meetings and even onboard UFO encounters -- they're all here. 
          Many of these stars have faced intense ridicule and skepticism, but they are sticking 
          to their stories. They not only believe in UFOs, they know!</p>

          <p>What happens when a hugely famous person sees a UFO? Could the ETs be contacting 
          famous people intentionally? Are the ETs reaching out to famous people because they 
          know that celebrities have profound influence upon millions of people and have a 
          platform to reach a very wide audience?  Some of these cases seem to indicate this.</p>

          <p>Whatever the reason, the list of superstars who have seen UFOs is longer than you 
          might think. The seventy-plus cases presented here  are likely just the tip of the 
          iceberg. Hopefully this will inspire many other famous people to admit the truth about 
          their own UFO encounters.</p>

          <p>This video is dedicated to the late Timothy Green Beckley, author of "UFOs Among the 
          Stars," one of the first books about celebrity UFO encounters.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Millions of people across our planet have seen UFOs. Some people 
          see UFOs and also experience missing time. When a witness experiences missing time, this 
          is a very strong indication of a possible onboard UFO encounter. In case after case, people 
          who have a close-up sighting experience a period of amnesia, and are unable to recall what 
          happened during the missing time.</p>

          <p>Missing time used to be thought of as very rare, but now investigators believe it might 
          be fairly common, involving perhaps as many as one in fifty people. If true, this would 
          mean that millions of people have been taken onboard UFOs.</p>

          <p>This video presents three cases of UFO encounters with missing time:</p>

          <p><b>CASE ONE</b>: A mother and her two daughters are confronted by three objects. As 
          they rush home to get a camera and binoculars, they mysteriously forget everything.</p>

          <p><b>CASE TWO</b>: A man in Malibu begins meditating and trying to call down UFOs. 
          After a series of sightings, he experiences a mysterious event in which a UFO apparently 
          lands in his backyard.</p>

          <p><b>CASE THREE</b>: Two friends driving along a remote desert highway late at night 
          come upon a glowing object which strikes them with a beam light, causing missing time, 
          followed by a radical shift in their lives.</p>

          <p>What is it like to see a UFO close up and experience missing time?  How does it 
          affect a witness? How do people deal with this kind of an encounter and still try to 
          live a normal life?</p>

          <p>This video is a glimpse into the experience of missing time and the secret life of 
          UFO contactees. While having missing time does involve amnesia, it is also ironically 
          an unforgettable experience, one that witnesses think about every day of their lives.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Nearly every aspect of UFOs and extraterrestrials has been 
          studied in detail. Investigators have researched cases involving landing traces, radar-
          returns, animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic effects, UFO propulsion, ...
          the list goes on and on! One aspect of Ufology that has been largely overlooked, however, 
          is: the smell of UFOs!</p>

          <p>The sense of smell plays a powerful role in human perception, and is closely connected 
          to memory. And with amnesia exhibiting itself in so many UFO encounters, the importance 
          of smell in connection to aliens and UFOs becomes even more profound.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than 30 cases involving witnesses who smelled unusual odors 
          during their UFO encounter. These cases have occurred over many decades and come from 
          all across our planet, and yet they are surprisingly consistent. Over and over again, 
          people report odors that are remarkably similar. An exploration of these cases reveals 
          some surprising and significant insights into the nature and origins of UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials.</p>

          <p>What do aliens and UFOs smell like? What do these scents tell us about these mysterious 
          visitors to our planet? The answers may surprise you!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On the <b>morning of January 17, 1994</b>, a massive 6.8 
          earthquake struck the city of Northridge, California. It caused millions of dollars 
          worth of damage, destroyed hundreds of structures, and 57 people lost their lives. What 
          many people don't know about is the UFO connection.</p>

          <p>On the night before this encounter, several people in the surrounding area had incredible 
          UFO encounters. One of the witnesses, Marcellina X., was a resident of nearby Topanga Canyon. 
          In the hours preceding the Northridge Quake, Marcellina experienced a series of precognitive 
          events, and along with her boyfriend (and others) saw numerous UFOs. This led to a profound 
          spiritual transformation and two weeks later, a face-to-face encounter with gray 
          extraterrestrials. The ETs had a personal message for her that caused huge changes in 
          Marcellina's outlook and worldview. Her life would never be the same.</p>

          <p>This video tells the story of Marcellina's strange encounters and the weird UFO connection 
          to the Northridge Earthquake of <b>1994</b>. This is one of many cases in which people have 
          seen UFOs before major disasters. This case also provides some of the answers to the aliens' 
          agenda on our planet.</p>

          <p>If you would like to learn more about Marcellina's case and other encounters which 
          occurred in the surrounding area and time frame, you might be interested in the book,

          <h5>Aug 15, 2021 (1:13:51)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is well-known among UFO investigator's that there is a 
          contagion factor with UFO encounters. If you associate closely with a UFO contactee, 
          this greatly increases your own chance of having a UFO encounter.</p>

          <p>As a general rule, UFO researchers try to remain objective, which guards against 
          distorting the evidence with a one's personal viewpoints about the phenomenon. However, 
          by jumping into the middle of an active UFO case, UFO researchers run the considerable 
          risk of  losing objectivity by becoming involved in the events as they happen. And 
          sooner or later, this objectivity can be completely shattered when the UFO investigators 
          become, in turn, investigated by UFOs.</p>

          <p>It is a clear-cut case of the hunter becoming the hunted. The extraterrestrials are 
          able to turn the tables with startling ease, and overnight a UFO investigator can be 
          transformed into a UFO abductee. And this has, in fact happened to several UFO 
          researchers who have plunged headlong into cases involving UFO abductions.</p>

          <p>This also works in the other direction. Many UFO witnesses are so impressed by their 
          own encounters, that they themselves begin to investigate UFOs, sometimes becoming highly 
          influential in the field of ufology. In some cases, researchers believe they were destined 
          by the ETs to become involved in investigating UFOs.</p>

          <p>This is the phenomenon known as "UFO Investigator's Disease." A surprising number of 
          researchers suffer from this condition. Many have gone public, however, others are 
          keeping this a secret. And others might be completely unaware that they themselves have 
          been contacted by aliens!</p>

          <p>What happens when a UFO researcher contracts UFO investigator's disease? Does 
          investigating UFOs truly run the risk of attracting UFOs? How many researchers suffer 
          from this condition?</p>

          <p>This video presents twenty cases of "UFO Investigator's Disease." You just might be 
          shocked to see the names of the prominent researchers who have found themselves the 
          target of UFOs. If you would like to explore more about UFO Investigator's Disease,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Hundreds of books about UFOs and extraterrestrials are 
          published each year. In fact, there are so many books, that it is nearly impossible 
          for anyone to read them all. Many of these books are re-hashes of old material. Others 
          are simply not very good. Many fantastic books get buried under an avalanche of mediocre 
          books.</p>

          <p>Today, there are many thousands of UFO books, and yet only a small portion have made 
          a truly valuable contribution to our understanding of UFOs and extraterrestrials. With 
          so many books flooding the market, how then is someone able to differentiate between the 
          good, the bad and the ugly? How can we choose which books to invest our precious time and 
          money in?</p>

          <p>Of course, what constitutes a great book is a matter of subjective opinion. And yet, 
          excellent research is fairly easy to identify.  Many people have asked, what are the best 
          UFO books? Which books are worth reading? This video presents a top fifty countdown of what 
          (IMHO as a longtime UFO researcher) are among the best UFO books ever written.</p>

          <p>These are the UFO books that are considered classics of ufology, books that have become 
          runaway bestsellers, books that have been well received by the UFO community, books that 
          have undeniably shaped our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Hopefully this list will 
          give the prospective reader a starting point, or offer some suggestions for books that 
          will provide an accurate, truthful and interesting overview of the very complicated 
          subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials.</p>

          o class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs have visited virtually every location on this planet, 
          but one of the most active areas in the world is the state of New Mexico. Some of the 
          world's most famous and influential encounters have taken place here. These are cases 
          that have helped shape our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Part One of this video presents the best cases from number twenty down to number 
          eleven. Now, in Part Two, we explore the top ten cases, moving from number ten all the 
          way to number one! Sightings, landings, photographic cases, face-to-face meetings with 
          extraterrestrials, onboard UFO encounters, UFO crashes -- they're all here. These top 
          ten cases cover the entire gamut of the UFO phenomenon, and provide conclusive evidence 
          for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials. These "best of the best" cases will 
          change the way you feel about UFOs.</p>

          own unique history of UFO encounters. The state of New Mexico has been a hotbed of UFO

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Compared to UFOs, reports of USOs (unidentified submersible 
          objects) are relatively rare. Even more rare are reports of USOs with humanoids. Only a 
          small handful of these kinds of cases exist. And yet, the stretch of water known as the 
          Santa Catalina/San Pedro Channel, along the southern California coast, has produced 
          several USO cases with humanoids.</p>

          <p>This video presents three such cases, all in close proximity to each other. The 
          first case involves a UFO landing on a beach at Playa Del Rey, an encounter that has 
          stunning new corroboration. The  second case involves a baffling USO encounter off the 
          coast of Catalina Island, an incident which involves many strange aspects that have yet 
          to be explained. The third (and perhaps most remarkable) case occurred at Lake Casitas 
          (a human-made reservoir,) located a short ways inland on the northern end of the Santa 
          Catalina channel. In this case, the witness actually managed to photograph the USO as 
          it emerged from the lake. This entire area is extremely active and has produced more 
          than 150 UFO/USO reports stretching back at least 100 years, and it is still going on 
          today!</p>

          <p>Why is this area so active? What happens when someone sees a USO with humanoids? What 
          exactly is going on here? This video offers a small glimpse into one of the strangest 
          aspects of USO activity in this area.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1984</b>, following the unexpected death of my mother 
          from a heart-attack, I began having unusual experiences. First I saw her spirit appear 
          to me as an apparition. Then I started having lucid dream-like encounters during which 
          she would visit me in my bedroom. Then I started having out-of-body experiences.</p>

          <p>Astral projection experiences have been reported for thousands of years, but I 
          had no idea that anyone could have them. After working hard to learn how to have 
          out-of-body experiences, I began to leave my body, explore the physical world, fly 
          and walk through walls and more. I soon began to travel to the Other Side and had a 
          wide variety of incredible experiences such as: meeting my mother and taking a tour 
          of the heavenly realms, meeting with spirit guides, learning about past lives, 
          basking in "the Light," learning in the Akashic Library, rescuing lost souls, and 
          so much more.</p>

          <p>This video is the story of how I learned how to leave my body, and the wonderful 
          experiences I had on Earth and in the many higher dimensions on the Other Side. I 
          also present methods that anyone can use to have their own out-of-body experiences.</p>

          <p>Is astral travel dangerous? What are the obstacles? Can anyone do it? What are the 
          benefits? What kind of experiences can you have? What happens when you leave your 
          body and travel into other dimensions. This video answers all these questions and more! 
          Would you like to have an out-of-body experience? Are you willing to at least try?</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Among the most commonly reported extraterrestrials types are 
          grays, human-looking ETs and praying mantis. Another category, however, might be termed 
          "strange humanoids." These include aliens that are only rarely reported or are apparently 
          completely unique.</p>

          <p>This video presents three cases involving "strange humanoids." The first case involves 
          a young child who was visited for a period of two weeks by strange blue-skinned dwarfs. 
          The second involves a businessman who was confronted by three uniquely described, ten-
          foot-tall humanoids. The third case involves an artist/street-vendor who had a face-to-
          face encounter with a dark-eyed female figure who displayed her highly unusual appearance 
          to the witness in very public place. In each of these cases, the ETs had a message that 
          was specifically for the witnesses themselves.</p>

          <p>These three cases show just how strange and unusual the UFO phenomenon can be, and 
          that sometimes people see extraterrestrials that most people have never even heard of. 
          These cases also show that extraterrestrials can appear in places that you would never

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many different types of extraterrestrials: grays, 
          human-looking ETs, reptilians, tall whites, little blue beings, hairy dwarves and 
          strange humanoids of all kinds. One well-known species are called praying mantis (or 
          mantids.) These are usually described as being anywhere from six to nine feet tall, but 
          can be both shorter or taller. Witnesses say they have an insectoid appearance much like 
          a praying mantis or even a grasshopper, with long stick-like limbs, thin torsos, and 
          massive dark eyes.</p>

          <p>This video presents three separate cases, each involving a person who has had a 
          face-to-face encounter with a praying mantis extraterrestrial. You will hear about a 
          young married woman whose encounter was revealed during a hypnosis session. Another 
          involving a college professor who had a missing time episode and then began having 
          nightmares about being chased by a giant humanoid grasshopper. And a third case 
          involving a teacher/daycare worker who encountered a praying mantis ET while out for 
          her morning jog near her home.</p>

          <p>What do the mantids look like? What is it like to have an encounter with a giant 
          humanoid praying mantis? These three cases answer these questions and more. The 
          witnesses have bravely stepped forward and revealed their encounters in the hopes of 
          helping others who may have had similar experiences.</p>

          <p>If you would like to explore more about these cases and others, you may bee interested

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On <b>March 16, 1967</b>, an incredible event occurred at 
          Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, USA. Multiple UFOs hovered at very low elevation 
          over the nuclear missiles sites, and were viewed by many military officers at the base. 
          Then, one by one, the nuclear Minuteman ICBM missiles mysteriously went offline. The 
          entire base went on high alert. There was an immediate investigation and a cover-up of 
          the event. Years later, in <b>1994</b>, one of the witnesses, Captain Robert Salas went 
          public and disclosed the event. After locating other witnesses, Salas published the book, 
          FADED GIANT in <b>2005</b>, and the encounter became established in UFO History.</p>

          <p>In <b>2015</b>, retired army officer Mel Hansen was shocked to learn that the Malmstrom 
          incident was being presented on television. He was a firsthand witness to the encounter, 
          but had always kept his participation in the event a secret from everyone except a few 
          family members. Now that it was being shown on TV, Mel decided that it was time for him 
          to talk about what he saw on that amazing night.</p>

          <p>This video presents the incredible story of Mel Hansen, and what he saw and 
          experienced at Malmstrom AFB in <b>March of 1967</b>. It was an encounter that would 
          drastically alter his life and leave him forever convinced of the reality of UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials. Mel's story provides further confirmation of one of the most 
          important and profound cases in UFO history, a case that the Air Force is still trying 
          to cover-up to this very day!</p>

          <p>If you would like to explore more about Mel Hansen's encounter at Malmstrom AFB and 
          his other UFO encounters, his story is told in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">How would you like to hear a long conversation with someone 
          who comes from another planet? Actually, you can! This video presents the testimony of 
          a woman who actually recalls traveling from another world to planet Earth for a very 
          specific mission. At first "Wendy" (pseudonym) had no idea that she was not from Earth. 
          But after a series of dramatic encounters with gray aliens, Wendy began to remember her 
          past as an extraterrestrial. She now remembers actually living a life on a planet far 
          away from Earth, and then traveling to this planet to help teach humanity and awaken 
          them to a whole new paradigm.</p>

          <p>After years of keeping her experiences secret, Wendy has decided that now is the time 
          to step forward and share her amazing story with the world. Why are the ETs here in such 
          large numbers? What does the future hold for our planet. How can humanity move through 
          the dramatic shift that is now taking place? Wendy answers all these questions and more. 
          This is one of the most unusual cases of ET contact you have ever heard.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Unidentified Submersible Objects! UFOs aren't only flying 
          around in our skies. They are also swimming around in our oceans, in our lakes and 
          other bodies of water, perhaps in large numbers. A UFO becomes a USO the instant it 
          hits the water and disappears beneath the surface.</p>

          <p>What are USOs doing in our oceans? How many of them are there? Where are they going 
          and why are they down there? Until recently, there hasn't been very much research into 
          USO activity. Now, however, there are hundreds of documented cases.</p>

          <p>This video presents five USO cases involving high strangeness, including:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Four teenagers encounter a USO in Lake Hamilton, Arkansas and experience an 
              episode of missing time.</li>
            <li>A young couple boating on Lake Miccosukee in Florida watch a UFO dive into the 
              water and head straight for them, underwater.</li>
            <li>A married couple vacationing in the Bahamas find themselves targeted by a massive 
              USO which swims directly under their boat.</li>
            <li>A man and woman walking along the California coast in Mendocino see a UFO dive 
              into the water, and then later, watch it rise up and fly away.</li>
            <li>Three people attending a dinner party in Aptos, California watch a USO emerge from 
              the ocean, fly over to the local Moss Landing power plant, and then do something 
              which leaves them all speechless.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>USOs are being seen all over our planet. It's time we start investigating these strange 
          accounts and learn what secrets are hidden beneath the surface of our oceans, lakes and 
          rivers.</p>

          <h5>May 22, 2021 (1:39:13)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Many Air Force Bases across the United States and the world 
          have been visited by UFOs. But there is one specific Air Force base that may be at the 
          top of the list: Edwards Air Force base. The shocking and astounding events that have 
          occurred at Edwards Air Force base go way beyond mere UFO sightings. In fact, virtually 
          the entire range of the UFO phenomenon is represented. There are sightings, landings, 
          face-to-face meetings with ETs, UFO crashes, abductions, reverse engineering of UFO 
          technology and more!</p>

          <p>Events began as early as <b>1947</b> and are still continuing today. Way back in 
          <b>1947</b>, a two-days-long series of sightings put the base on high alert and changed 
          the way the Air Force viewed and handled the UFO phenomenon. Following this, the base 
          was visited regularly. For some reason, Edwards AFB  has become a magnet for the UFO 
          phenomenon. Few other locations on Earth have experienced the magnitude and frequency 
          of UFO encounters.</p>

          <p>This video presents a gripping chronological history of UFO activity at this highly 
          technological location. You will hear about dozens of close-up sightings, the day a 
          UFO landed on the runway and was filmed by Air Force officers, the alleged meeting 
          with President Eisenhower and extraterrestrials, a little known UFO crash, multiple 
          cases involving reverse-engineering of ET technology and so much more, including cases 
          that have never been revealed before. The military has done their best to cover-up 
          these events. But the truth can no longer remain hidden. The public deserves to know 
          the truth. The US government has known for more than 70 years that UFOs and aliens are 
          real. Now it's time that the world knows.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Do you believe that there are unknown creatures lurking in 
          the depths of our lakes and oceans? The answer of course is, yes! Mainstream science 
          discovers new species each year. And yet, some creatures still remain very  elusive. 
          Among these are lake monsters and sea serpents. Lakes and oceans across the United 
          States and the world contain mysterious creatures that have yet to be identified by 
          scientists. And the state of California is filled with them.</p>

          <p>California alone has several lakes which have produced many reports of strange lake 
          monsters. And you may be surprised to hear that the California coast is one of the 
          leading producers of sea serpent reports in the world. These reports have been 
          occurring for more than 100 years and yet, nobody knows what they are!</p>

          <p>This video presents the baffling but true stories of several lakes in California which 
          are believed to contain strange creatures. Lizzie of Lake Elizabeth, Elsie of Lake 
          Elsinore, Hodgee of Lake Hodges, Tessie of Lake Tahoe...and more! Most startling are 
          the dozens of reports of giant sea serpents up and down the California coast. Many of 
          these reports are extremely well-verified, coming from highly credible witnesses who 
          have put their sterling reputations on the line by coming forward with their own 
          eyewitness accounts.</p>

          <p>What do these creatures look like? How big are they? How often are they seen? The 
          answers might surprise you. One thing seems certain, very large creatures exist on our 
          planet that have yet to be discovered and identified.</p>

          <p>High strangeness is at your fingertips. Are you ready to have your own encounter 
          with the unknown? If you would like to explore more about lake monsters, sea serpents
          and other strange mysteries in California, check out

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A Ouija Board is a tool normally used for contacting and 
          communicating with spirits. However, there are now many cases on record in which 
          people do not contact ghosts...instead they contact aliens. In fact, many people not 
          only communicate with ETs using a Ouija Board, they have initiated encounters, 
          actually calling down UFOs and summoning aliens.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than twenty firsthand cases involving the Ouija Board 
          and UFO encounters. The connection is undeniable. In some cases witnesses were able 
          to photograph UFOs and even the ETs themselves. Even stranger, some cases involve 
          Bigfoot. UFOs are known for having high levels of strangeness. And these unique 
          cases show just how strange the UFO phenomenon can be.</p>

          <p>How do people contact aliens and UFOs with a Ouija Board? Why does this method 
          work? Is it dangerous? This video answers all these questions and more.</p>

          unusual cases that don't fit the standard model of UFO contact, please check out

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is unknown how many people have been taken onboard 
          UFOs, but it may be a lot. The problem is, many of these events are shrouded in 
          missing time and amnesia. However, this is not always the case. Some people have 
          fully conscious encounters. One of these people is a gentleman from England by the 
          name of Gary.</p>

          <p>Ever since he was a young boy, Gary began having dramatic UFO sightings and 
          face-to-face encounters with gray aliens. It wasn't long before he was taken onboard 
          their craft and subjected to a wide variety of bizarre experiences. While many people 
          recall only being physically examined, Gary recalls many other incredible experiences, 
          many of which have rarely been reported in the UFO literature, and some which might 
          be totally unique. Few people have the extensive recall of their experiences like 
          Gary. His case contains both harrowing events and encounters that are incredibly 
          humorous. It is one of the most unusual cases on record.</p>

          <p>If you would like to learn more about Gary's experiences, and other people who have 
          had onboard UFO encounters, please check out my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Humans can fly! In part one of this video, we explored ten 
          outstanding cases of human levitation. In part two, we now explore the very best 
          documented cases of people who have flown. These are not flying dreams or out of body 
          experiences. These are cases in which people have physically levitated off the ground. 
          Every single one of these top ten cases involves multiple outside witnesses (sometimes 
          hundreds or even thousands) who viewed the levitations firsthand. In four of the cases, 
          the levitations were actually photographed. Several of the levitators provided detailed 
          descriptions of their own experience, including how they levitated, and what it feels 
          like to rise up from the ground and fly.</p>

          <p>These cases show that human levitation is not a matter of speculation; it is a 
          proven and demonstrated fact. The evidence speaks for itself. As amazing and fantastic 
          as it may seem, humans can actually fly up into the air without the aid of any 
          mechanical device. Instead, levitation appears to be a natural human ability, one 
          that manifests under very rare conditions.</p>

          <p>These case are only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, there are more than 330 
          documented cases of levitation, stretching back thousands of years and coming from 
          many cultures all across our planet.</p>

          <p>For those would like to explore more about these cases and the hundreds of others,

          <h5>Can humans fly?</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">As strange as it sounds, the answer is, yes! Humans do have 
          the ability to levitate and fly through the air without the aid of any device. In fact, 
          there are hundreds of accounts of human levitation on record. Cases reach back thousands 
          of years and come from all across the world.</p>

          <p>This video presents the top twenty best verified cases of human levitation. In part 
          one, we cover cases twenty through eleven, each involving a person who has undergone the 
          profound experience of human levitation. While many cases rely solely on the word of the 
          person who experienced it, these accounts are different. These cases not only involve 
          outside witnesses, some of them involve photographic evidence, or were proven in a 
          scientific laboratory setting. These cases prove that humans have super-human abilities 
          that we have only just begun to discover.</p>

          <p>What is it like to levitate? How is it done? Can anybody do it? This video (and part 
          two) will answer all these questions and more. Levitation is real! Humans can fly! This 
          is not a matter of speculation or belief. The evidence speaks for itself. The proof is 
          here. And now is the time to rise up, discover who we really are and what we can do.</p>

          <p>And if you think these cases are exciting, just wait for Part Two. The adventure has 
          only just begun!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Would you like to meet extraterrestrials and go onboard their 
          craft? Are you sure?</p>

          <p>UFO encounters can be sometimes be traumatic, and they can sometimes be very friendly. 
          Often they can be both scary and enlightening. Initially, many witnesses may find their 
          experiences quite fearful. However, as they overcome their fear and face their encounters 
          head-on, their experiences begin to transform into something much more spiritual and 
          benevolent.</p>

          <p>This video presents the story of Pat Brown, who asked to meet ETs and go onboard their 
          ship, and got a little more than she bargained for. Her wish was granted and she began to 
          meet extraterrestrials face-to-face. At first she was terrified, but slowly her encounters 
          began to transform into events both healing and educational. The ETs taught her all about 
          spirituality, and even took her on a tour through outer space.</p>

          <p>After years of encounters, she came to realize that the ETs were not trying to harm her 
          or scare her, but in fact were helping her along the spiritual path towards enlightenment. 
          Given the choice, she has elected to keep having encounters and learn all she can from these 
          mysterious visitors to our planet.</p>

          <h5>What do aliens talk about?</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Often ETs seem to be very tight-lipped. The only words they 
          speak are: "Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. Come with us." This is especially true 
          if the witness has a strong reaction of fear. But this is not always the case. In some 
          accounts, people are able to hold long interactive conversations with aliens, during 
          which they learn all about the ETs, who they are, where they come from, and their 
          agenda on Earth.</p>

          <p>This video presents four true firsthand accounts of people who were able to talk with 
          the ETs in-depth, carrying on long conversations that reveal many of the questions 
          people have about extraterrestrials. ETs provide all kinds of information, imparting 
          sage advice, revealing details of their home worlds, and even explaining why they 
          contacted the witnesses. They share information about our society and their own, give 
          warnings and predictions, answer any questions the witnesses ask, and so much more.</p>

          <p>As a result, many people who first were very fearful of their encounters become 
          transformed, and realize that ET contact can be very benevolent. Being taken onboard 
          a UFO might seem scary, but in fact it is often a truly enlightening and healing 
          experience.</p>

          <h5>Have you ever seen a UFO?</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">A sighting is the most common type of UFO encounter. And 
          each sighting has something important and profound to teach us about the nature and 
          origins of the UFO phenomenon. Often, a close-up sighting brings deeper levels of 
          contact that might not first seem apparent. If someone sees a UFO, the chances are 
          good that the ETs are showing themselves intentionally. Sometimes, what might seem to 
          be a simple sighting is in fact a much more extensive encounter.</p>

          <p>This video presents ten different sightings, each of which has something to contribute 
          to our understanding of UFOs and extraterrestrials. A UFO-car chase; an object hovering 
          over a busy airport; a man who has had more than 40 sightings; a saucer hovering 
          directly over powerlines; a small town embroiled in the center of a massive UFO wave; 
          two teen-agers targeted by a massive, fiery object; a family with a close-up encounter 
          that only some remember, a group of objects over a city center viewed by hundreds of 
          people; a mother ship hovering for hours and releasing smaller craft; a UFO that 
          telepathically calls the witness outside to see it -- these sightings show how varied 
          and complex the UFO phenomenon can be.</p>

          <p>A UFO sighting has the capacity to totally change a person's life, and alter forever 
          the way they view themselves and the world. Never underestimate the power of UFOs!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFO healings are now a recognized feature of extraterrestrial 
          encounters. What many people don't know, however, is that there are also several cases 
          on record of animals being healed. The most common category by far is dogs, but other are 
          reports of other animal UFO cures too.</p>

          <p>This video presents eight cases of animals who have been healed as the result of a UFO 
          encounter. These cases are important because they not only show a benevolent side to UFOs 
          and aliens; they also show just how truly advanced the ETs are when it comes to healing.</p>

          <p>Compared to reports of humans being healed, cases of animal healings are exceedingly 
          rare. That alone makes accounts like these significant. Why are the ETs healing animals? 
          How are they affecting these cures? What does this say about these mysterious visitors to 
          our planet?</p>

          <p>Using firsthand eyewitness testimony and actual true-life cases, this video attempts 
          to answer all these questions and more. If you'd like to learn more about animals who 
          have been healed by aliens, please check out my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Just imagine: you’re watching your favorite movie at the 
          local drive-in theater when suddenly you see a strange flying object swoop down from 
          above and hover right over the movie screen. The object is metallic, saucer-shaped, 
          with portholes and colored lights, and is totally silent. It’s a UFO! Cars start 
          honking and flashing their lights. People exit their cars, pointing and screaming. 
          Some drive away in terror. Then the UFO starts to move around over the theater 
          putting on a show that’s far more interesting than the movie itself!</p>

          <p>It may sound like science fiction, except it’s true! This video presents dozens of 
          firsthand cases in which UFOs have targeted drive-in theaters. In these cases, UFOs hover 
          at very low levels for long periods of time, and are observed by hundreds of witnesses. 
          Often there are strange electro-magnetic effects. Sometimes humanoids are seen.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Grays are the most commonly reported type of extraterrestrial. 
          Many of the cases are strikingly similar, however, they also have significant differences. 
          Some are scary and traumatic, while others seem benevolent. This video presents four 
          first hand cases of different people who have encounters gray aliens.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Connie</b>, a housewife from Arleta, California sees a gray outside her window, 
              staring at her newborn son.</li>
            <li><b>Kim</b>, a retired Army vet from Bourbonnais, Illinois, wakes up to see three 
              grays surrounding his bed, telling him to get up and go with them.</li>
            <li><b>Natalie</b>, a graphic artist from Norway is accosted by three grays in her 
              bedroom, who start to perform an operation on her back.</li>
            <li><b>Harry</b>, an auto mechanic from Vandalia, Ohio is driving with his wife when 
              they come upon a UFO and two gray aliens hovering above the road.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Four cases involving gray aliens, each with profound similarities and differences. Who 
          are these grays visiting our planet? Why are they here? These four cases provide a little 
          glimpse into the gray agenda and answer some of the questions we have surrounding these 
          mysterious visitors.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">When people think of UFO crashes, the Roswell UFO Incident is 
          usually the first to be mentioned. But the truth is, the Roswell UFO crash is only one of 
          hundreds of similar cases involving UFO crash/retrievals. California alone has at least a 
          dozen documented accounts of UFOs that have crashed and been retrieved (and sometimes 
          reverse-engineered) by the United States military.</p>

          <p>Several military bases across California have allegedly been involved in UFO crash/retrievals 
          including Edwards Air Force Base, Camp Pendleton, Sunnyvale Naval Air Station, Norton Air Force 
          Base and more. What does our government know, and why are they hiding the truth? If California 
          has more than a dozen cases, how many cases are there?</p>

          <p>The time for disclosure is now. If the US government truly has obtained UFOs and alien 
          bodies, they should disclose the truth. This video provides a little glimpse into the history 
          of UFO crash/retrievals in California. More than likely, this is only the tip of iceberg.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>July of 1982</b>, eleven friends went camping at 
          Blackjack Campground in a remote area on Catalina Island, off the coast of southern 
          California. Around sunset a thick fog rolled in. Shortly later, the UFOs arrived. 
          Three unidentified glowing objects approached silently and hovered in front of the 
          witnesses. As the eleven friends struggled to understand what they were seeing, 
          the temperature dropped dramatically. Somebody noticed that their watches had all 
          stopped. Someone else discovered that their flashlights weren't working. Nor were 
          their cameras.</p>

          <p>Then the show began. Beams of brilliant light flashed between the objects. Before long, 
          one of the objects released other craft, which soon approached the witnesses.</p>

          <p>So begins an encounter which would change the lives of eleven people forever. It's a 
          multiple witness UFO encounter involving multiple strange effects both electromagnetic 
          and physiological.</p>

          <p>Catalina Island is located in a UFO hotspot. Many other encounters have occurred on the 
          Island and in the surrounding area. The UFO encounter at Blackjack Campground is one of 
          nearly 150 cases involving UFO and "USOs," unidentified submersible objects.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It's unfortunate, but it's true. Many people have lost their 
          job as the result of a UFO encounter. If word gets out that you have seen a UFO, or that 
          you believe you have been taken onboard a craft, or even if you are merely interested in 
          the subject, sorry -- you're fired! You are now unemployed. Pack your personal belongings. 
          Your final check is in the mail.</p>

          <p>Discrimination against UFO experiencers and investigators is a real problem in society. 
          Experiencing a UFO encounter can be traumatic. But then witnesses sometimes have to deal 
          with the additional trauma of being disbelieved or ridiculed, or actually losing their 
          livelihood.</p>

          <p>This problem is particularly acute among the police, whose job it is to watch out for 
          anything unusual. And yet when they report something very unusual, what happens?...They're 
          fired.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than a dozen firsthand cases of people who were terminated from 
          their place of employment for talking about UFOs. Police, doctors, pilots, politicians -- 
          all have had their careers destroyed by getting too close to UFOs. And it's the denial of 
          our own governments to admit the reality of UFOs that has caused this appalling situation.</p>

          <p>The time is now for truth and transparency on the subject of UFOs. If you would like 
          to explore more about these cases and others, check out my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Angel Hair: it's a mysterious cobweb-like substance being 
          ejected from UFOs. Despite countless numbers of UFO encounters, reports of Angel Hair 
          are exceedingly rare. But in a handful of UFO sightings, this mysterious material drifts 
          down from the sky like cotton candy, covering trees, bushes, fields, homes, cars, 
          telephone wires...everywhere.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than twenty UFO events involving Angel Hair. Some of the 
          cases include:</p>

          <p><b>1952</b>: Oloron, France. A large mother ship and thirty UFOs blanket the town with 
          huge volumes of a stringy white substance.</p>

          <p><b>1953</b>: San Fernando Valley, CA. Jets chase a silver sphere, which ejects enough 
          Angel Hair to cover a two block area.</p>

          <p><b>1954</b>: Tuscany, Italy. A football game with 10,000 fans is interrupted by UFOs 
          which swoop down and release a glittering, white, flaky substance over the crowd.</p>

          <p><b>1954</b>: Marysville, OH. More than 60 students and teachers at Jerome Elementary 
          see a UFO which covers not only the entire school, but a six-mile radius around them.</p>

          <p><b>1955</b>. Whitsett, NC. More than 120 students and teachers at Whitsett Elementary 
          experience a dramatic UFO display involving enormous quantities of what looks like cotton 
          candy. One student even tries to eat it!</p>

          <p>And this is just the beginning. Cases reach back many years and continue to occur today.</p>

          <p>In most cases, Angel Hair dissolves and evaporates in minutes, or upon contact. In a few 
          cases, however, there are immense quantities of the stuff, and eyewitnesses are able to 
          preserve precious samples. In a few rare cases, Angel Hair has been subjected to scientific 
          analysis. And the results are astonishing.</p>

          <p>What is angel hair? What is it made of? Why is it being ejected from UFOs? Is this just 
          the "exhaust" from flying saucer engines? Is this material being intentionally ejected? 
          Most importantly, what is it made of?</p>

          <p>This video presents the evidence as we know it so far. Angel Hair is important because 
          it is tangible, physical evidence of the existence of UFOs. Read more about these cases

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Physiological effects as the result of a UFO encounter are very 
          rare, and yet they do happen. Following a close-up UFO encounter, people sometimes experience 
          dry or sore eyes, eye irritation, burns or inflammation, after-images on the retina or light 
          sensitivity. Less common, but equally consistent, are cases of physiological improvements. 
          Among the most common of both are accounts involving the eyes.</p>

          <p>This video presents twenty firsthand cases of people who have experienced ocular 
          improvements in association with a UFO encounter. Imagine being color blind, and then 
          you have a strange visitation and are able to see colors for the first time. Imagine 
          being diagnosed with glaucoma, and then finding help greeting you from beyond the stars. 
          What if you lost your vision, and afterward, someone unique and unexpected arrived in 
          your time of need? Or what if you were visited by ETs, and now suddenly you start 
          having psychic visions?</p>

          <p>Could the UFO occupants be here to help us? Sometimes the answer might be, yes! 
          The evidence shows that something profound is happening here.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Many researchers have studied and remarked upon the obvious 
          similarities between modern day UFO accounts and stories in the Bible and about Jesus. 
          Some have come to the belief that Jesus may have actually been an extraterrestrial. 
          Much of the research into this area has focused on ancient and historical accounts, 
          including many paintings throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance which portray 
          Jesus and UFOs in the same scene.</p>

          <p>This video, however, focuses on current firsthand UFO accounts which contain overtly 
          religious elements. The fact is, there are several recent cases on record in which people 
          have reported seeing Jesus or other religious figures onboard a UFO! Investigators call 
          these "mixed motif" cases, encounters which contain both extraterrestrial and religious 
          themes. While these cases seem to be very rare, there are enough to raise serious questions 
          about UFO origins and the connections between ETs, angels, demons and humanity itself.</p>

          <p>Are UFOs angelic in origin? Could they be demonic? Are we dealing with a powerful 
          interdimensional intelligence that shapeshifts and wears different masks? Or can these 
          accounts be explained as extraterrestrials in the classic sense?</p>

          <p>Whatever the explanation, these mixed motif cases defy the standard model of UFO 
          contact, and may contain important insights into the nature of the phenomenon.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Most UFO encounters don't involve Bigfoot. And most Bigfoot 
          encounters don't involve UFOs. But in a growing number of cases, these two seemingly 
          separate phenomena perfectly intersect. There are now dozens of cases on record in 
          which people have seen Bigfoot and UFOs at the same time, in the same place. In some 
          instances, people report seeing Bigfoot entering or exiting extraterrestrial craft. 
          And in a few, people say they have seen Bigfoot onboard a UFO.</p>

          <p>As strange as this sounds, this weird confluence is well-known among UFO researchers, 
          many who have cases to contribute. But wait, there's more! Some of the cases involve 
          other strange events, such as poltergeist activity or telepathic contact with Bigfoot.</p>

          <p>What is going on here? Is Bigfoot an alien? What exactly is the connection between 
          Bigfoot and UFOs?</p>

          <p>This video presents a wide variety of firsthand cases which illustrate the many 
          strange connections between Bigfoot, UFOs and other paranormal phenomenon.</p>

          Bigfoot connection, check out my book, <a

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Catalina Island, located off the southern California Coast, 
          is the central focus of a huge amount of UFO and USO (unidentified submersible objects) 
          activity. The cases in this area reach back more than 100 years and are still occurring 
          today. Among the strangest and most dramatic are several cases of UFOs seen by groups of 
          boy scouts and camp directors.</p>

          <p>This video presents three incredible cases in which UFOs have put on a display for a 
          large group of boy scouts and adults on Catalina Island.</p>

          <p>In <b>1952</b>, an encounter at Camp Fox, Catalina Island was viewed by 350 witnesses 
          and reached the highest levels of military intelligence.</p>

          <p>In <b>1992</b>, a group of boy scouts and directors at Camp Cherry Valley, Catalina 
          Island observed a dramatic display involving an object darting around, spinning, and 
          sending down beams of light.</p>

          <p>In <b>2013</b>, boy scouts and camp directors from Emerald Cove Boy Scout Camp observed 
          a fantastic two-hour long display involving more than 200 objects of many different shapes 
          and sizes.</p>

          <p>These incredible cases provide some unique insights into the UFO activity in this 
          area, and into the nature of the phenomenon itself. For those who would like to hear 
          more about these and other cases, please check out my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In <b>1960</b>, a 21-year-old young man named Jim, joined the 
          Navy and was stationed aboard the US Navy aircraft carrier, USS Valley Forge as an 
          electronics specialist and a helicopter crew member of the HS-3 Hunter Killer antisubmarine 
          squadron. While returning from the Mediterranean Sea to the United States, Jim and at least 
          ten other crew members observed multiple unidentified glowing objects, UFOs, off the 
          starboard bow of their ship. The objects remained in view for nearly an hour, beginning a 
          mystery that would leave a trail of unanswered questions.</p>

          <p>Jim soon learned two things. First, there was an apparent coverup of the event. Second, 
          this incident was not just a simple sighting, but involved direct contact, perhaps actual 
          onboard UFO encounters. In fact, he himself had memories he couldn't explain.</p>

          <p>This video presents one man's amazing story about his participation in a multiple 
          witness UFO incident on the USS Valley Forge, and how he came to realize that his 
          sighting might actually involve an onboard encounter and face to face contact with ETs. 
          Jim had a long conversation with the UFO people, and was given a profound and important 
          message for all humankind, one which would have a profound impact on his entire life.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are not just a nuts and bolts phenomenon. There is also a 
          strong spiritual aspect to extraterrestrial encounters. In fact, a wide variety of paranormal 
          events surround UFOs. A close encounter often has a huge impact on a person, challenging them 
          on multiple levels, physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It's very clear that 
          UFOs have a powerful connection to human consciousness and spirituality.</p>

          <p>This video presents seven firsthand UFO cases in which spirituality played a profound 
          role. Spirit quests, meditation, ghostly visitations, dreams, premonitions, OBEs, 
          channeling, psychic healing...all of these are part of the UFO phenomenon. Over and over 
          again, people who have close encounters find themselves spiritually transformed.</p>

          <p>What exactly is the connection between UFOs and the paranormal? While the answers remain 
          elusive, these cases show that this connection manifests in a wide variety of ways.</p>

          <p>The man who climbs a mountain to overcome an internal struggle is greeted by a UFO. 
          A lady tired of the world retreats to the wilderness to find herself instead confronted 
          with something otherworldly. Two young ladies struggle with an angry poltergeist only to 
          find that something else even more bizarre has also arrived for a visit. These and other 
          astounding cases will show you how truly strange the UFO experience can be.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs appear to represent a very advanced technology. The 
          extraterrestrial craft can move at dazzling speeds, turn at right angles, change into 
          various shapes and even turn invisible. Another incredible talent of UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials is their miraculous ability to change their size. They can make 
          not only make themselves and their ships large or small, but they can also do this 
          to human beings.</p>

          <p>This video features twenty UFO cases in which extraterrestrials display their seemingly 
          magical technology, causing bizarre spatial anomalies of many kinds. UFOs that are bigger 
          on the inside than the outside, miniature UFOs with tiny aliens, people who are struck by 
          mysterious UFO beams of light that cause them to shrink or grow in size -- something very 
          strange is happening here. The ETs' ability to manipulate space and time is undeniable.</p>

          <p>As these cases show, extraterrestrials have a technology that allows them to do things 
          that are boggle the imagination. It's important that people know how truly advanced these 
          beings are.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">New York is one of the most influential places in the world. 
          Not surprisingly, it has a rich history of UFO events, many of which have had a strong

          <p>Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, humanoids, onboard UFO experiences, UFO

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs have often been seen over nuclear power stations, 
          nuclear missile sites, and anything associated with nuclear energy. In <b>1971</b>, 
          the USS Clamagore, a Navy submarine equipped with nuclear torpedoes, encountered 
          a UFO, or actually a USO (an unidentified submersible object) which approached the 
          sub and paced it for fifteen minutes.</p>

          <p>This incredible encounter is only one of many, many instances in which UFOs and USOs 
          have been encountered by the US Navy. This video presents the UFO Incident on the USS 
          Clamagore, as well as four other incredible UFO/USO encounters by Navy and other 
          military personnel.  Some of these encounters include a sighting by the crew of the 
          USS Long Beach (a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser,) a fascinating USO sighting 
          by two retired Navy submariners near San Simeon, California, a highly dramatic USO 
          sighting witnessed by dozens of people off the coast of Redondo Beach, California, 
          and finally a visitation by a fleet of glowing donut-shaped USOs by a US Coast Guard 
          Captain off the coast of Haiti.</p>

          <p>In some cases, these UFO events went unrecorded or were actively covered up. This 
          raises the question, how often does our Navy encounter UFOs and USOs and never reveal 
          it? As these cases shows, perhaps more than you might think!</p>
          
          <p>Until recently, there has been very little research into USOs. And yet, if these and 
          other cases are true, then our oceans could be swarming with large numbers of alien 
          craft, most of which remain unseen by human eyes.</p>

          <p>It is time for disclosure of all UFO information. These incidents and others should 
          be known by everyone! If you would like to learn more about these and other remarkable 
          USO encounters, please check out my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984340700/..."

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are many very strange procedures that occur during 
          onboard UFO encounters, but one that has been given more than its fair share of 
          attention is the alien anal probe. It has become the butt of jokes on the internet. 
          It has saturated nearly every aspect of our culture. The media has targeted this one 
          particular procedure to a degree that it has come to define the UFO abduction 
          experience in its entirety.</p>

          <p>While many people have joked about the alien anal probe, the truth is, it is very 
          serious, especially to those on the receiving end. This video presents a deeper look 
          into this bizarre phenomenon, and provides an in-depth analysis. It shows how the 
          media has focused on this one particular aspect of the UFO experience above all 
          others. It also presents firsthand cases from leading UFO researchers and the 
          experiencers themselves.</p>

          <p>Why are ETs flying light years to examine the anuses of innocent humans? What is the 
          purpose behind this extraordinary extraterrestrial excremental experimentation?</p>

          <p>This video answers all these questions and more. For those who would like to learn

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">All across the world, people are experiencing onboard UFO 
          encounters. This is the story of two young brothers who were abducted into a UFO in 
          <b>1978</b> from their home in a quiet suburb in the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>This is an important case because the main witness, Andy, recalls his experience 
          consciously without the use of hypnosis, and is able to provide a clear description 
          of the interior of the craft. Also, it's a multiple witness case with many interesting 
          and unusual details, including a weird encounter with a "USO," an unidentified 
          submersible object.</p>

          <p>Andy was only twelve years old when his bedroom filled with light and he found 
          himself taken into a UFO. Now, many years later, he has bravely stepped forward 
          and allowed his incredible story to be told.</p>

          <p>Most UFO investigators today agree that UFO abductions are a real phenomenon. They 
          still represent the cutting edge of UFO research, and provide the most opportunity to 
          learn about these strange visitors to our planet.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Sometimes UFO encounters are shrouded in a weird forgetfulness. 
          Amnesia is a very real problem when dealing with extraterrestrials. Many encounters occur, 
          but the witnesses forget about them. This video presents three incredible UFO encounters 
          during which the witnesses experienced amnesia and other weird amnesia-like effects.</p>

          <p><b>"The Case of the Glowing Egg"</b>. Hearing about recent sightings in their area, three 
          teen-age boys go out UFO hunting and get more than they bargain for when a strange egg-
          shaped craft shows up, confronting them face-to-face.</p>

          <p><b>"Beamed by a UFO"</b>. Nineteen-year-old "Jay" and his friend hear about a nearby 
          farm that is being visited by UFOs. They decide to investigate, causing a series of UFO 
          encounters that will change Jay's life forever.</p>

          <p><b>"Five Hours Onboard a UFO"</b>. Starting at age twelve, "Jack" experiences a series of 
          bizarre events, all of which remained unexplained. Then 25 years later, a weird accident 
          occurs which causes Jack to remember everything.</p>

          <p>Three cases of close encounters, each involving profound forgetfulness and missing time. 
          How can an event as amazing as UFO contact be totally forgotten? As these cases show, the 
          ETs seem to do it with perfect ease. This raises the question, how many people have been 
          taken onboard a UFO and don't remember anything?</p>

          <h5>Oct 10, 2020 (0:59:42)</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On the weekend of <b>March 26-27, 1994</b>, the Triad UFO 
          Conference (funded by billionaire Robert Bigelow) was held at the Del Coronado Hotel on 
          Coronado Island in southern California. Featured were leading abduction investigators 
          Budd Hopkins, Yvonne Smith, John Carpenter and others. Several hundred people attended 
          the conference.</p>

          <p>Mike Evans, his wife, and a small group of other friends decided to attend. Unknown 
          to them, they were about to become embroiled in one of the strangest and most unique 
          events in UFO history: a mass UFO abduction. Six witnesses in three adjoining hotel 
          rooms at the Village Inn all experienced an alien encounter on the same evening. Meanwhile, 
          conference attendees at other nearby hotels also experienced extraterrestrial visitations.</p>

          <p>Coronado Island is a small, densely populated island, much of which is owned and used 
          by the United States Navy. It's a popular tourist destination, heavily guarded by police 
          and military personnel. In other words, an unlikely location for a mass UFO abduction.</p>

          <p>But wait, there's more! At the time of the abduction, the presidential Secret Service 
          swarmed the island. President Clinton was visiting the next day. He planned to stay at 
          the home of Larry Lawrence, US Ambassador to Switzerland, owner of the Hotel Del Coronado 
          and one of the wealthiest men in the United States. Lawrence was a huge donor to President 
          Clinton's campaign. And by some strange coincidence, the home of Larry Lawrence and the 
          Village Inn were separated by only a few thousand feet.</p>

          <p>Another thing that makes this case different is many of the witnesses suffered alarming 
          physical symptoms following this encounter and others. One of the witnesses discovered 
          an apparent alien implant in her leg, which was subsequently removed by Dr. Roger Leir, 
          providing incontrovertible evidence of extraterrestrial intervention.</p>

          <p>This video presents the Coronado Island UFO Incident from beginning to end, as told 
          by one of the main percipients. Yvonne Smith's excellent book, "Coronado," tells the 
          comprehensive story of this case, with several more new witnesses. You can also read 
          about the experiences of the six experiencers at the Village Inn in my book,

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Alien clowns! It may sound bizarre, but it's true. People are 
          being visited by aliens dressed up as clowns! Several researchers have reported cases like 
          these. Extraterrestrials are not only dressing up as clowns, but in other strange outfits, 
          such as cowboy costumes or old-fashioned tuxedos and pin-stripe suits. Sometimes they even 
          come wearing wigs or toupees!</p>

          <p>Are these screen memories? Are the aliens actually wearing these clothes? What is the 
          purpose behind this strange behavior? If they are trying to reduce the fear factor, it's 
          not working very well! Fear of clowns is so common, it has its own name: coulrophobia. 
          Could the ETs responsible for this widespread fear of clowns?</p>

          <p>This video presents true firsthand cases from people across the world who have encountered 
          aliens dressed up as clowns or other characters. It also provides some insights into why this 
          might be happening.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Some UFO encounters are scary. Some are friendly. And some 
          UFO encounters actually save people's lives. In case after case, people report that 
          ETs have intervened to rescue them from dangerous situations such as car accidents, 
          drownings, assault, natural disasters and more.</p>

          <p>Trapped on a sinking boat, caught in quicksand, lost on an unfamiliar highway, suffering 
          from poverty, about to experience a seemingly unavoidable collision, in danger of being 
          overwhelmed by a hurricane...ETs suddenly show up and rescue people right when they need 
          it most.</p>

          <p>Are ETs truly here to help people? Are they our friends? As these twenty cases show, 
          sometimes the answer is yes! These cases reveal a benevolent side to the UFO phenomenon 
          that deserves more attention. ETs are not only healing people, they are saving their 
          lives. Talk about friends in high places!</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are being seen all over our planet. But there is one 
          specific type of location that is attracting large numbers of UFOs: mines! UFOs are 
          targeting our mines. Gold mines, silver mines, iron mines, copper mines, titanium mines, 
          uranium mines and more: all are being visited by UFOs.</p>

          <p>UFOs are not only hovering over mines, they are also landing. Humanoids are being 
          seen. In some cases, the mines are being physically affected. Photographs have been 
          taken. Some mines have been targeted over and over again. Cases come from across the 
          United States, Canada, Central and South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, Australia 
          and more.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than 50 cases involving extraterrestrials miners. These 
          include close encounters of the first, second and third kinds. Clearly, something 
          very profound is happening here!</p>

          <h5>Alien Zoos!</h5>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">ETs have been studying our planet for a very long time. 
          They seem to be interested in all things Earth. They have taken humans onboard their 
          craft. They have collected a wide variety of plants. And they are also taking animals. 
          In fact, there are several cases on record in which experiencers have seen collections 
          of live animals onboard UFOs. This video is not about animal mutilations; it's about 
          something much more bizarre. As strange as it sounds, some abductees report being 
          taken to visit alien zoos, containing animals from Earth, and also animals from other 
          planets. Some UFOs, it seems, are very much like "Noah's Ark," preserving a wide 
          variety of species.</p>

          <p>Some of these cases have a very high level of strangeness, including chimera-like 
          creatures from ancient mythology, or even in a few cases, dinosaur-like creatures.</p>

          <p>The ETs' interest in animals is also betrayed by the many cases in which UFOs and 
          extraterrestrials have been caught taking animals of all kinds. Farm animals seem to 
          be a primary target, but a wide variety of animals have been abducted into UFOs.</p>

          <p>In a few cases, ETs seem to be particularly interested in our closest animal 
          companions, dogs and cats. One case contains a shocking revelation explaining why 
          they have such a strong interest in our pets.</p>

          <p>Alien zoos may sound strange, but there are too many cases to ignore. Something 
          very strange is happening here.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">ETs are abducting people and collecting their genetic material. 
          They are abducting animals. And they are also abducting plants! As these accounts will 
          show, ETs have been collecting a wide variety of plants for a very long time.</p>

          <p>And that's not all. If you are taken onboard a UFO, the last thing you might expect 
          to see is a forest. And yet, this has happened more than you might think.</p>
          
          <p>And the cases get even stranger. In some cases, ETs  provide advice about gardening. 
          In others, they use more direct methods. Imagine a UFO shines down and causes a plant 
          to double in size. There's more than one case like it!</p>

          <p>Why are ETs collecting plants and growing forests onboard UFOs? What is the motive 
          behind this agenda? ETs have been warning people about Earth changes for many years. 
          Perhaps they have decided to take action themselves. Could UFOs be like Noah's Ark, 
          trying to save the species of our planet?</p>

          <p>Only one thing is for sure: ETs are here, and they are taking our plants.</p>

          <h5>Aug 22, 2020 (1:03:30)</h5>
          
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In the first week of <b>November 1957</b>, a series of dramatic 
          and unusual UFO events occurred which caused great concern at the highest levels of 
          government and changed the way many people viewed the UFO phenomenon. Sputnik 1 had been 
          launched one month earlier, and the launch of Sputnik 2 was imminent. Then, in the first 
          week of <b>November 1957</b>, a dramatic wave of UFO encounters struck the states of 
          Texas and New Mexico. The apparent primary target was a small town called Levelland.</p>

          <p>What happened in Levelland, Texas was unprecedented and had never occurred before, and 
          has yet to be repeated. Dozens of people in Levelland and the surrounding areas reported 
          UFOs disabling their vehicles, causing the electrical system to fail and the car engines 
          to cease functioning. In case after case, UFOs buzzed cars at low level, and often landed 
          on the road, blocking their way forward. UFO car-stalling cases were well-known among 
          UFO researchers, but this brazen and audacious level of activity had never been reported 
          before.</p>

          <p>While the small town of Levelland, Texas and the surrounding area first appeared to be 
          the target, the truth was much different. In fact, similar and often identical encounters 
          occurred across the United States and the world, involving not only car-stalling cases, 
          but many bizarre electromagnetic effects on a wide variety of machines.</p>

          <p>UFO researchers had long known that UFOs cause these strange effects, but had considered 
          them an accidental byproduct of close-up UFO sightings. But after what happened in 
          Levelland, questions began to be raised. Perhaps these effects weren't accidental at 
          all. Perhaps they  were intentional.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government and Project Blue Book officials first attempted to debunk and cover-
          up the events, claiming that sightings were nothing more than "ball lightning," while 
          at the same time, warning military and civilian witnesses not to speak to the press.</p>

          <p>But it wasn't ball lightning. The sightings were too dramatic to ignore, and soon 
          garnered national headlines. The Levelland UFO encounters have never been explained 
          and remain a mystery to this day. Nothing like them has ever occurred before or since.</p>

          <p>This amazing event was easily the most famous UFO event of the year, and is well known 
          among researchers. However, what many people don't know is just how numerous, dramatic 
          and widespread the encounters actually were, or the consequences that followed. This 
          video presents a minute-by-minute account of this incredible week in <b>November 1952</b>. 
          The questions as to why, however, have yet to be answered.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Ever since the Modern Age of UFOs began in <b>1947</b>, 
          UFOs have been closely monitoring humanity's progress into space. When the U.S. 
          military began to actively launch missiles at White Sands in New Mexico, UFOs 
          immediately made their presence known, not only following the missiles in full view, 
          but sometimes intervening to cause the missiles to fall to Earth. When more rocket 
          launches occurred, UFOs were often there. Wherever rockets were being launched, UFOs 
          showed up, including not only White Sands, but China Lake, Vandenburg, Holloman and 
          other areas. While the U.S. military scrambled to deal with the sudden UFO presence, 
          at the same time they aggressively tried to cover-up the events.</p>

          <p>But as the UFOs continued to show themselves, still sometimes disabling the rockets, 
          whistle-blowers recognized the importance of what was happening and courageously 
          alerted the public of what was happening.</p>

          <p>These are not simple sighting. Under the J. Allen Hynek system, some might be 
          classified as Close Encounters of the Second Kind, during which UFOs affect the 
          environment (disabling a missile.) But in actuality, they are all human-initiated 
          encounters and are more accurately classified as CE5 events.</p>

          <p>This video presents about twenty cases in which UFOs have showed up during rocket 
          launches. As most of these events have been covered up, the actual number is 
          certainly much higher.</p>

          <p>The incredible events that have occurred at White Sands, Holloman AFB, China Lake, 
          Vandenburg AFB and other areas have yet to be fully revealed.</p>

          <p>As this video will show, the UFO occupants' interest and monitoring of rocket launches 
          is likely comprehensive, as there are cases in which UFOs have shown up during the 
          launching of toy model rockets! Some UFO abductees have been told directly that we are 
          being observed.</p>

          <p>Why are UFOs monitoring and disabling missiles? What happened to all the camera footage 
		  showing these events? How many times has this happened? We all deserve to know the truth 
		  about the UFO presence on our planet. Cases like these are profoundly important and can be 
		  ignored no longer.</p>

          <p>For those who would like to learn more, I have documented these (and other) 
          cases in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Here-Selected-UFO-Articles/dp/153280458X"

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">There are more than 300 UFO healing cases on record. Some 
          cases, however, rise above the rest. This video presents 20 of the very best UFO healing 
          cases. These well-documented accounts come from men and women across the world, and 
          involve the healings of a wide variety of injuries, illnesses and diseases. Many of the 
          cases have been verified by doctors and UFO researchers.</p>

          <p>These UFO healing events are important because they present hard physical evidence of 
          extraterrestrial intervention in people's lives. They also have many things to teach us 
          about these mysterious visitors to our planet. They show us that there is no such thing 
          as a chronic or incurable disease. They also show a very positive side to ETs and 
          their agenda on Earth.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">UFOs are hovering over prisons!</p>
          <p>UFOs are known to be attracted to technological installations such as power stations, 
          military bases and more, including, evidently, prisons. These are not coincidental 
          fly-bys. In these cases prisons are being directly targeted. The objects hover at very 
          low levels for long periods of time. They are often viewed by both prison officials 
          and inmates.</p>

          <p>There are more than 20 cases on record. These are not simple sightings, but also include 
          physiological effects and strange electromagnetic effects. In a few cases, photographs 
          have been taken. There's at least one case of a landing. Humanoids have been seen, and 
          there's even an apparent abduction. Clearly something very profound is happening here!</p>

          <p>San Quentin Prison, Lebanon Correctional Institute, Colorado State Penitentiary and 
          many others have all had encounters. Some locations have been visited repeatedly. The 
          question, of course, is why? After watching this presentation, you will know the answer.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">On the <b>evening of June 14, 1992</b>, a massive UFO wave 
          occurred over the small community of Topanga Canyon, California. Hundreds of UFOs were 
          seen by multiple witnesses across the canyon. Objects hovered over homes, shot across 
          the sky, chased cars down the road, even lifting one up in the sky. But the full story 
          has never been told. Until now. This video presents brand new startling information 
          about this famous case, including excerpts from phone calls made to the police, new 
          eyewitnesses, photographs and more, including an apparent abduction.</p>

          <p>On this evening, numerous people called the police, the local newspaper, and UFO 
          groups. In this video, you will hear the police tape firsthand, and listen to actual 
          witnesses reporting the incredible events which occurred on that evening. The night of 
          <b>June 14, 1992</b> remains one of the most incredible UFO events in California history, 
          and marked the beginning of a two-year-long UFO wave of stupendous proportions.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Are you ready to go swimming inside a UFO? It's among the 
          strangest of events that occur to abductees when they are taken onboard an 
          extraterrestrial craft. They are placed in an aquarium-like tank and made to breathe 
          a thick gelatinous liquid. Many researchers have investigated cases like these: David 
          Jacobs, Barbara Lamb, Yvonne Smith and others. While there are several theories, the 
          exact purposes of the UFO breathing pool remain unknown.</p>

          <p>This video presents more than a dozen cases of abductees who have experienced the UFO 
          breathing pool. What is it like to be placed in this liquid?  What kind of liquid is it? 
          How are people able to breathe in this liquid and still survive? There are now enough 
          documented cases to provide a clear picture of this unique procedure and the reasons 
          behind it.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">In Part One of this presentation,  dozens of cases of UFOs 
          hovering over schools were presented. Now, in Part Two, we explore the more exciting 
          cases involving landings and humanoids. There are five very famous incidents of UFOs 
          landing next to schools:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Ariel Elementary School, Ruwa, Zimbabwe.</li>
            <li>Broad Haven Primary School, Wales.</li>
            <li>Crestview Elementary School, Opa-Locka, Florida.</li>
            <li>Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Michigan.</li>
            <li>Westall High School, Melbourne, Australia.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>What many people don't know is that these five cases are just the tip of the iceberg. 
          There are at least 40 documented accounts of UFOs landing next to schools. Often 
          humanoids are seen. In some cases, messages are given. In a few cases, children are 
          abducted. Government coverups, landing trace evidence, medical effects and more. The 
          cases reach back more than 100 years and come from all over the world.  Something very 
          profound is happening here!</p>

          <p>This video presents the cases chronologically, as they happened.</p>

          <p>Why are UFOs hovering over and landing next to schools? What kinds of messages have 
          people received? What exactly is the purpose behind this agenda? This video will 
          answer all these questions and more.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">All across the world, schools are being targeted by UFOs. More 
          than 100 documented cases are on record. These are typically long lasting, low level, 
          daylight encounters viewed by large groups of witnesses. Something very profound is 
          happening here.</p>

          <p>This video is Part One of a two-part presentation on the history of schoolyard UFO 
          encounters on our planet. Why are UFOs targeting schools? What happens when a UFO hovers 
          over a school playground and is viewed by hundreds of witnesses, including teachers?</p>

          <p>The cases shown here will answer these questions and more.</p>

          <p>Part One covers dozens of sightings, starting as early as 1853 and continuing to the 
          present day. There are cases of UFOs hovering at extremely low levels, sometimes causing 
          panic on the playground. There are cases involving photographs and moving films. Two 
          cases involve physical evidence in the form of angel hair. In some cases, there is a 
          strong government response.</p>

          <p>And this is just the beginning! While the sightings are amazing enough, even more 
          astonishing are the many cases of landings and humanoids. Part Two of this 
          presentation: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schoolyard-UFO-Encounters-True-Accounts/dp/1075776988"

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It's one of the rarest types of UFO encounters: cases in which 
          people are given alien artifacts by the ETs. There are a surprising number of cases coming 
          from across the planet. Crystals, metal bars, food, medicine, books, mechanical devices...
          all have been given to abductees by alien beings. What happens when somebody is given an 
          actual alien artifact? The results may surprise you.</p>

          <p>This video presents nearly a dozen cases in which people were given alien artifacts.

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">It's one of the strangest types of UFO behavior, and kind of 
          creepy. UFOs are hovering over graveyards and cemeteries, usually at very low levels. 
          In some cases, they land and humanoids are seen. In other cases, graves are being 
          disturbed. Clearly something very profound is happening here.</p>

          <p>In this video I present about a dozen cases coming from major researchers across the 
          world. UFOs are definitely attracted to graveyards. The question is: why?

          the control room and told how the craft works, or are even put in the control seat and 
          allowed to fly the craft themselves. In even rarer cases, the ETs provide specific

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Have you ever received a phone call from an ET? As fantastic 
          as it sounds, some people have. UFO contact comes in many different forms, including by 
          telephone. In this video I present several cases in which people have held telephone 
          conversations with extraterrestrials. For more info, see my book, 
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Here-Selected-UFO-Articles/dp/0692650210" 
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Not From Here: Selected UFO Articles, 
		  Volume One" title="Not From Here: Selected UFO Articles, Volume One.">"Not from Here: Selected 
		  UFO Articles, Volume One"</a>.</p>

          <h5>Introduction</h5>

          <p>Hello everyone. My name is Preston Dennett. Today I'd like to like to talk to you a 
          little bit about my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Not-Here-Selected-UFO-Articles/dp/0692650210" 
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Not From Here: Selected UFO Articles, 
		  Volume One" title="Not From Here: Selected UFO Articles, Volume One.">"Not From Here: Selected 
		  UFO Articles, Volume One"</a>, which is about the more unusual and lesser-known aspects of 
		  the UFO phenomenon. Today I want to talk about my favorite, chapter 2, which is called "Phone 
		  Call from an Alien". I know how that sounds but the fact is there are now a number of cases on 
		  record in which people have received phone calls from the apparent ETs.</p>

          <h5>Jack Sarfatti</h5>

          <p>Probably one of the better cases is that involving a quantum physicist by the name 
          of Jack Sarfatti. He's a pioneering quantum physicist, a champion Bell's Theorem and 
          claims that sub atomic particles are connected non-locally. Which has turned out to be 
          true. But when Mr. Sarfati was 12 or 13 years old, he received what was apparently a 
          phone call from an ET. He heard this mechanical sounding voice that asked him if he 
          wanted to learn from him. Sarfatti said "yes, sure" and he expected to have physical 
          contact and gathered all his friends, hoping the UFO would show up and it never did. 
          That's all he remembers. Except his mom says no that's not exactly what happened.</p>

          <p>According to her memory, the phone calls continued. Her son would take them and he 
          started to act very strangely. Talking about these very highly scientific and exotic 
          topics. She became concerned and the next time the phone rang, she took it from him 
          said "don't call here anymore". That's when the calls stopped. But Jack Sarfati has 
          told this story publicly and it's only one of many in which people have received 
          apparent phone calls from ETs.</p>

          <h5>Debby Jordan</h5>

          <p>Another well-known case would be that of Debby Jordan who is the star client in the 
          Hopkins book, "Intruders". She went by the pseudonym Debbie Kathy Davis. But she has 
          since come out publicly about her abductions with gray-type ETs. Lesser known about 
          her experiences is that she received a bunch of weird phone calls. Apparently from ETs. 
          This began in <b>1980</b> when she was pregnant. Debbie began to receive the series of 
          phone calls. It was always on a Wednesday. She would hear these strange noises, hums, 
          clicks and beeps. Occasionally, these voices speak a strange seemingly alien language. 
          The calls continued for about nine months. Then suddenly stopped, after she had her 
          child. But when the child grew up and began to speak. He began to speak in words that 
          reminded Debbie Jordan of the language she heard on the phone while she was pregnant 
          with him.</p>

          <p>So, I'm not really concerned here. I'm thankfully the child grew out of it and there 
          seems to be a connection there and not the only case like this Raymond Fowler a very 
          well-known investigator ran into this sort of case phone call from an alien.</p>

          <h5>Betty Andreasen</h5>

          <p>When he began working with Betty Andreasen, an abductee from Massachusetts. And daily, 
          Andreasen in <b>1977</b> was talking with her then-boyfriend Bob Lucca when an ET broke 
          in on the conversation. In an angry voice. And she actually heard the words "it's finished, 
          it is done." This wasn't the only time she had calls like this. She would often hear these 
          voices, sometimes they did sound angry. Sometimes not. But often they'd be speaking what 
          sounded like a foreign language with lots of "L's" and "T's" in it.</p>

          <h5>Whitley Strieber</h5>

          <p>Whitley Strieber talks about something similar that which happened to him where he was 
          with his wife. This is around <b>April of 1977</b> and suddenly this stereo started 
          talking to them. They held a brief conversation with the voice over the stereo which 
          should be impossible. It's got no transmitter. He actually remembers the line of the 
          conversation was the small boy saying "I know something else about you". Clearly 
          these cases are unusual, but they're not unheard of.</p>

          <h5>Harold Wilkins</h5>

          <p>Harold Wilkins, a pioneering UFO researcher, revealed  several cases in which strange 
          voices had come over radios. John Peel, another early pioneering researcher, said "oh, 
          this happened many times" and he received calls like this with strange clicks and beeps. 
          He says it was not unusual during a UFO flap, where this sort of thing would happen. Over 
          radios and even televisions. I know another case in which a gentleman saw seven UFO. As 
          he counted them very carefully and raced off, his phone rang. He didn't answer it, but 
          when he looked at it to see who had called, the personal number that it showed was all 
          sevens. Sevens which he felt were a message from the 80s and certainly very unusual. Not 
          a bell number. So I'm not sure what to make of these cases.</p>

          <h5>Donald Kehoe</h5>

          <p>Donald is a pioneering researcher. He talked about this as well. He said that he 
          talked to fighter pilots. He said that it was clear to them that the UFOs were listening 
          in on radio conversations. And I have run into cases of this myself. A couple of New York 
          abductee times. Probably the most dramatic is a case that I included in my latest book, 
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inside-UFOs-Accounts-Contact-Extraterrestrials/dp/153970002X" 
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Inside UFOs: True Accounts of Contact with 
		  Extraterrestrials" title="Inside UFOs: True Accounts of Contact with Extraterrestrials.">
		  "Inside UFOs: True Accounts of Contact with Extraterrestrials"</a>, and it occurred to a 
		  New York abductee named Kenneth. He has had abductions his whole life. A lot of experiences. 
		  When he was down in Florida where he lived for a while, he started receiving these strange 
		  phone calls.</p>

          <p>It's very much like Betty Andreasen and Debbie Jordan described it. Always come on the 
          same day and usually it was just a dead phone or he'd hear strange noises but one time 
          he's back up in New York and he's driving along and his phone starts ringing he looked. 
          Except it's ringing in a weird tone that he's never heard before. The phone normally 
          does not make us not it's normal ringer. He looks at the readout and it says it's no 
          number or the lines just dead so he doesn't answer it. Then it rings again. He looks 
          down and says no number he answers it and he hears these weird clicks and noises and 
          this voice starts talking and suddenly it says the time has grown closer and shortly 
          after that is UFO showed up and the ETs showed up and he had what was perhaps the 
          most profound abduction in his life.</p>

          <p>He was fully conscious as the ETS told him why they had been abducting him this whole 
          time. So it's clear that these cases are widespread they've been a occurring for a long 
          time and continue to occur. As unusual as they  sound it really fits right into the spectrum  
          of UFO contact. UFOs are well-known for affecting all kinds of electromagnetic instruments 
          including automobiles, lights, radios, &amp; televisions. So, it should be a surprise that 
          Bay and effect phones as well. Perhaps this is why they're seen so many times over high 
          high tension wires, telephone wires. Just a theory. All we really know is that these 
          cases are taking place and will probably continue to take place. So, next time the phone 
          rings, who knows it might just be an ET calling you.</p>

		  presents 10 all new cases of people who have had extensive contact with UFOs. We're gonna 
		  try and get through  all 10 cases in less than three minutes.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 1: Kevin</h5>

          <p>The first chapter is about a man named Kevin. A Navy corpsman who is invited aboard 
          UFO where he met 15-foot tall praying mantises who took him  on a time travel trip it's 
          an extraordinary case.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 2: Tyler</h5>

          <p>Is about a gentleman I call Taylor. He's now a doctor he was a little boy his  
          mom sent him out to mail a letter and he instead had contact with friendly Nordic  
          aliens and this began a lifelong contact  with great Ike ETS a really interesting case.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 3: Paperboy</h5>

          <p>Is about a gentleman who is now a college professor. As a young boy he was 
          delivering papers when the UFO came right down on top of them he experienced missing  
          time and some extraordinary after-effects as a result of his encounter I think it's a very  
          important case.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 4: Jeannie</h5>

          <p>Is about a lady named Jeannie and she found out that she was having contact with a 
          9-foot tall grasshopper type ET as well as gray type ETs it's an extraordinary case.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 5: Writer/Professor</h5>

          <p>It's about a gentleman a professor and writer who was driving along and had a UFO 
          land right in front of him and out stepped this handsome looking Nordic alien it's a 
          very interesting benevolent encounter with ETS.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 6: Alien Outside My Window</h5>

          <p>Involves an office worker &amp; new mother who had just had a baby boy and woke up to 
          see a gray type ET looking through her window straight at her newborn son It was a 
          terrifying encounter for her.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 7: Harry</h5>

          <p>Is about a gentleman named Harry who's had some extraordinary UFO sightings his entire 
          life one of his very close-up encounters was with his wife they were driving along the 
          road and they came upon a UFO hovering right alongside the road and there were two greys 
          looking outside a large picture window right at them. Harry has had some of the most 
          extraordinary "Wow" sightings of anyone I've ever interviewed another one of my favorite 
          chapters is;</p>

          <h5>Chapter 8: Jim</h5>

          <p>This is about a gentleman named Jim who worked in the Navy as an electronics specialist. 
          He had an extraordinary sighting with several shipmates. The sighing turned out to be much 
          more than a sighting. He was contacted by ETs who taught him about alternative energy sources. 
          It's one of my favorite cases in the book.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 9: Amazing Lady</h5>

          <p>This is about an amazing lady; a housewife and mother from Nebraska who became very 
          sick and suddenly had an encounter in which she was taken to what appears to be an 
          underground base where she was healed of her illness by a nine foot tall ET with orange 
          spiky hair. It's a totally unique case.</p>

          <h5>Chapter 10 Kenneth</h5>

          <p>The tenth and final chapter is about a man, a medical worker named Kenneth. He's had 
          extraordinary encounters, missing time, and face-to-face encounters with gray type ETs. 
          This is a fully conscious encounter in which the ETs explained exactly why they were 
          contacting him and he also experienced some very interesting after-effects.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Are UFOs mining the precious metals of our planet? The answer 
          is: yes! They have been seen over iron mines, copper mines, gold mines, titanium mines, 
          uranium mines and more. In many of these cases, the UFOs land and entities are seen. In 
          some cases, the mines are physically effected.</p>
