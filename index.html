<p class="tallFirstLetter">A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature is one of the most shocking and 
mindboggling experiences a person can have. And it happens more often than you might 
think. There are many thousands of documented cases. Most people who have these kinds 
of encounters rarely report it to UFO groups, so the actual number is likely much 
higher. These cases have been occurring for at least a hundred years and probably much 
longer. They occur all over the world to all kinds of people. This episode presents six 
particularly unusual cases. In each of these cases, the witnesses not only held 
conversations with the ETs, but they were given information that impacted them for the 
rest of their lives.</p>
 
<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ALIEN PLAN</span>. One evening in April 1962, five-year-old Worthington White woke up in his 
grandmother’s home in Quantico, Virginia to see light flooding into his bedroom through 
the attic door. He noticed three short child-like figures standing in the room. One of 
them approached and began to communicate telepathically, downloading information into 
his brain. The next morning, he knew his life would never be the same. In fact, he had 
incredibly ambitious goals and a whole new plan for his life. Growing up, he faced many 
challenges, but the advice given to him by the ETs appeared in his mind and helped chart 
the course of his life, eventually putting him in an incredibly influential career at 
the very top of the US government.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A GRAY SAT NEXT TO ME</span>. One night in June 1963, seventeen-year-old Victor was driving 
along a remote road in Deptford, New Jersey. Without warning, his headlights failed, 
his car engine quit, and he rolled to a stop. A sudden inexplicable and overwhelming 
fear swept through him and he realized someone was sitting next to him in his car. 
Looking over, he was shocked to see a short gray alien. It looked at him with such 
peace that he became instantly calm. In then communicating him with telepathically, 
filling his mind with volumes of information. It then disappeared, but from that 
point on, Victor slowly discovered that the gray had taught him many things.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE RAINBOW MAN</span>. One afternoon in summer 1974, two brothers, Thomas (age 5) and Kevin 
(age 4) from Needmore, Pennsylvania, noticed a hippy-looking man sit down in their 
backyard. The man began to communicate to them telepathically. Both boys noticed the 
man had a visible aura filled with rainbow colors. The man shared knowledge with them 
about themselves and the universe, taking them on an interactive journey into some of 
Earth’s natural wonders, and teaching them both about their past, present and future 
life. Both were deeply impacted by the encounter and found that the knowledge the man 
shared with them helped to guide them throughout their adult life.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I WAS SO SCARED, I STARTED TO CRY</span>. One night in summer 1988, a young boy, Jose de Diego 
Vazquez, was walking through the Yunque Rain Forest in Puerto Rico as part of a survival 
training course. Strange lights flew overhead and landed behind a large rock. Jose was 
petrified with fear when a male humanoid stepped out and began to speak with him, 
telling him not to be afraid. The figure then used strange symbols to share astounding 
information with the young boy. The man disappeared, and Jose ran back to camp only to 
be faced with a strange mystery. No time had passed during the entire encounter!</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE BLOOD OF THE KINGS</span>. On the night of January 10, 2010, a man heard a strange knocking 
sound on his back door in Toledo Ohio. Going to investigate, he was met by a short gray 
alien. The man invited the gray inside, at which point, a long conversation followed. 
The gray saud they had observed the man since childhood, that they were very interested 
in his genetics, and then proceeded to answer all the witness’s questions, even allowing 
the witness to touch the ET. The ET had some questions of his own. It was an encounter 
that would change the witness’s life.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE HARVESTERS OF MEMORIES</span>. Ever since he was a young boy, Christopher, a boy from South 
Dakota, had been visited by gray ETs. Usually they stood by his bed and seemed to study 
him. The visits occurred at least twice a year, but doubled when Christopher (who was 
being treated for Aspergers and depression) decided to stop taking prescription medicine. 
Christopher suddenly excelled physically, mentally and creatively. Then, on the night 
of February 26, 2015, he was visited by an 8-foot-tall elder gray who spoke to him 
telepathically, sharing incredible volumes of information about the ETs and their 
mission on Earth, and explained exactly why they found him to be of particular interest 
to them.</p>

<p>These six cases are important because they show that often an encounter with a humanoid 
appears to be an intentional event designed to impart wisdom to an individual to help 
guide them through their lives. They show that extraterrestrial contact can play a very 
powerful role in a person’s life-path.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">It is the closest of all UFO experiences: being taken onboard a craft. Cases like these 
represent the frontline of research. They contain more information than any other type 
of UFO encounter and offer the opportunity to answer the many questions that surround 
extraterrestrial contact, such as, who are these mysterious visitors to our planet, 
where do they come from, and why they are here. While some people remain skeptical that 
cases like these take place, the truth is that there are tens of thousands of reports, 
with indications that they may number in the millions. This video presents five 
particularly extensive and lesser-known onboard UFO encounters from across the world-
-cases which involve long interactions and conversations with extraterrestrials. Most 
of the cases involve multiple witnesses, each of who were given amazing information 
about the ETs and/or the future of our planet.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I HAVE NO FEAR</span>. On the night of February 4, 1974, a family of three was camping in a 
remote and isolated area of the vast Sonoran Desert in Mexico. In the middle of the 
night, they were awakened by a beeping noise but couldn’t locate the source. The next 
morning, the mother had the impression that a UFO had visited them in the night. Years 
passed, and they decided to explore the incident under hypnosis. Together, they recalled 
being taken onboard the craft by gray-type ETs. The father was given harrowing 
predictions about the future of humanity. The son recalled being shown strange alien 
symbols. The mother could only recall being led up to the craft. All four say that the 
strange encounter remains one of the most mysterious events of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I HAD A ROLE TO PLAY</span>. One night in June of 1975, a newly engaged couple were in Minong, 
Pennsylvania when they saw a UFO and experienced a period of missing time. They alerted 
their family who also saw the object. They flashed a light at it, and it flashed back 
and disappeared. Later, the couple realized that they had missing time and went under 
hypnosis. The woman recalled being taken onboard and meeting a glowing being face-to-face. 
He told her that the world was on the verge of catastrophe, and that she had a role to 
play in helping humanity. The man recalled only that the ETs were concerned for the 
world. Both say the encounter was benevolent.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">MY WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED</span>. In 1975, Frank Johnson of eastern Pennsylvania 
began meditating in the hopes of making contact with ETs. Immediately, he and his wife 
Alice experienced a series of close-up sightings outside their home. Then, one evening, 
the room lit up and the couple saw a UFO outside. The went outside and were suddenly 
pulled onboard the craft. They saw three human-looking figures in blue jumpsuits. The 
two were separated. The woman was given a physical exam and healed of a chronic 
medical condition. The husband held a long telepathic conversation with the ETs about 
astronomy, other dimensions and humanity. The two were then returned to their home. 
Later the woman had another missing time encounter.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">OUR MISSION IS ONE OF PEACE</span>. On the night of January 28, 1978, a man was hiking near Lago 
Vichuquen, Chile when a massive saucer-shaped craft appeared overhead, struck him with a 
beam of light and pulled him into the craft. He was greeted by three human-looking 
figures wearing tan-jumpsuits. Frightened at first, the witness calmed down as the ETs 
explained that they just wanted to speak with him. A very long conversation ensued, 
during which the ETs answered all the man’s questions and offered volumes of information 
about themselves and the history and future of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A PURE LEARNING EXPERIENCE</span>. At 2am on July 1, 1996, two men were driving near Coates, 
Minnesota when they heard a loud buzzing noise, and saw a glowing craft alongside the 
road. They stopped the car. One of the witnesses exited the car to take a closer look. 
The next thing they knew, hours had passed, they were approaching the next town, and 
it was morning. Later one of the witnesses went under hypnosis. He recalled being 
struck by a blue beam of light and pulled into the craft. He was greeted by two grays 
and a human-looking man. The ETs said that they had brought him onboard to teach him. 
The witness was shown many things and was told that he was part of their “plan” with 
humanity.</p>

<p>The importance of cases like these cannot be understated. The witnesses themselves have 
been deeply changed by their experiences, and the information they have been told 
firsthand by the ETs themselves has profound consequences for all humanity. the five 
cases presented here are just a tiny fraction of the true number of cases. The witnesses 
don’t have the luxury of disbelief. The question is not, are these cases taking place. 
The evidence speaks for itself. The question is, will humanity heed the advice given 
by the ETs?</p>

UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISIDE THIRTEEN</a>.</h3>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown Episode Thirteen,” the continuing investigative series 
which proves that UFOs are being seen everywhere on this planet. This series was born 
from a challenge: name any town, city or location on Earth, and I will find a UFO 
encounter there. And so far, 100% of the locations provided have a history of UFO 
encounters.</p>

<p>Today we explore five new locations, each provided by you, the viewers. 
These locations include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Pittsburg, California; Attleboro, 
Massachusetts; Oahu, Hawaii and Morganton, NC. These locations not only have been 
visited by UFOs, they have produced the entire range of UFO encounters. Sightings, 
USOs, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters and even a crash/retrieval case. Many 
are supported by compelling evidence: landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, 
EM disturbances, radar returns and startling photographs. This series proves beyond a 
reasonable doubt that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA</span>. In 1948, military pilots saw strange objects in the skies. 
More sightings occurred in the 1950s, which also produced startling cases of direct 
contact. In 1950, a woman reports that small humanoids entered her home and communicated 
with her telepathically. In 1954, a girl came upon a landed craft and a humanoid. In 
1964, a man was taken onboard a craft and examined. In 1967, a grade-school student 
had a strange encounter with a gray alien who had a profound message for her. Another 
young girl reports she was taken onboard a craft and given a medical exam by grays. In 
1978, more than 200 people observed a large craft moving over the city. On May 5, 1982, 
calls flooded the local police stations from people reporting UFOs. The 1980s brought 
more startling encounters, including a couple who saw a disc over the Birmingham Bridge, 
and man who collided into a UFO while driving. In the years that followed, Pittsburgh 
produced more encounters, making it clear that the city is of great interest to the ETs.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">PITTSBURG, CALIFORNIA</span>. This area has produced some very close encounters. In 1977, three 
boys were out hiking when a UFO landed nearby, and three strange humanoids chased them 
for several blocks. In 2009, a man observed a UFO so close to his home, his windows 
vibrated from the humming sound it produced. In 2014, a group of witnesses gathered in a 
McDonald’s Restaurant Parking lot and observed strange craft at very elevation.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">ATTLEBORO, MASSACHUSETTS</span>. In addition to many cases of anomalous lights, this city has 
some truly amazing cases. In December 1975, an entire family observed a spherical craft 
hover overhead. Some of them chased after it in their car, and they ended up having 
missing time. In 1981, three sisters called the police after a craft swooped down from 
the sky and buzzed their vehicle. In 1986, a family of four had a frightening encounter 
with a metallic disc which hovered right in front of their car. Unknown to them, numerous 
other people also saw the craft. In 2010, a family saw strange dome-shaped craft while 
driving near the home.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">OAHU, HAWAII</span>. This island has a very rich history of encounter. 1924, a young boy had a 
weird encounter with a humanoid on the beach. When a navy officer came upon a landed UFO 
and humanoids in 1944, the case resulted in an apparent retrieval of the craft by the 
military. The 1950s brought a flood of sightings, including a massive wave directly over 
Barber’s Point Naval Air Station. The 1960s and 1970s brought more sightings, several 
more humanoid cases, including onboard UFO encounters complete with profound alien 
messages. There were also some amazing photographic cases. Activity continued with dozens 
of encounters, even as recent as 2023.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">MORGANTON, NORTH CAROLINA</span>. This small town has produced several amazing encounters. A 
sighting over the North Carolina School for the Deaf involved more than a dozen 
witnesses. In 1980, a wave of sightings generated numerous calls to the police from 
concerned residents describing metallic craft hovering near their homes. In 1981, two 
young boys had a close-up encounter with a craft that would affect them for the rest 
of their lives. The 1990s brought more startling sightings of solid craft. A truly odd 
case occurred in 2006 when an inmate at the Foothills Correctional Facility reported 
seeing a UFO with humanoids right outside his cell.</p>

<p>This is just a summary of the many significant UFO events that have occurred in these 
locations. Once again, the evidence is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere on 
our planet. The obvious takeaway is UFO encounters are far more common than previously 
believed. And when one considers that the vast majority of people do not report their 
encounters, the actual number of cases must be mindbogglingly huge. It appears that the 
extraterrestrials are conducting a vigorous and well-orchestrated publicity campaign to 
announce their presence.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">The onboard UFO experience is the cutting edge of UFO research. It is the closest and 
most extensive of all encounters and holds the greatest potential to assist both 
contactees and researchers to better understand extraterrestrial contact. With tens of 
thousands of documented cases (and indications that they number in the millions) it 
behooves all humanity to take these accounts seriously. They have been occurring for 
over a hundred years, if not longer, come from all over the world, and are supported by 
a wide variety of evidence. This video presents ten extensive onboard encounters. In 
each of these cases, the witnesses were not only taken onboard; they were able to hold 
conversations with the ETs. Each of these cases provides fascinating and profound 
insights into what it’s like to have direct contact with extraterrestrials.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANNI LATTU</span>. In early 1917, the residents of the small village of 
Jyrinvaara, Finland were puzzled by the disappearance of Anni Lattu, who lived in the 
area. When Annie returned, she shocked everyone with her claim that a silver craft had 
landed next to her cottage, and short little beings had taken her onboard. Although 
she was frightened, the humanoids were very friendly and took her on a tour across 
the world and into outer space. They offered her the opportunity to stay with them. 
Annie declined, and they returned her to her home, days later.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I WAS LIFTED INTO THE SKY</span>. In the summer of 1953, Derek (age 5) was walking along a 
remote dirt road near his home in rural Phenix City, Alabama. He was nervous, as he 
had recently twice seen a Bigfoot-like creature in the nearby ravine. This time, he 
was shocked when a beam of light struck him from above and he found himself being 
lifted into the sky toward a metallic craft. Inside, he saw three humanoids, who 
assured him that no harm would come to him. He was returned, but that night, he woke 
up to see three even more unusual creatures in his room.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I WAS BEING WATCHED</span>. In 1961, Joyce Halfin (age 6) was in her bedroom in Ottawa, Canada 
when she saw strange figures by her window. Suddenly she flew up in the sky over her 
house. She blacked out and assumed it must have been a crazy dream. But she knew it 
wasn’t and as she grew up, more encounters occurred. Curious, she tried hypnosis, and 
learned that in 1961, she was taken onboard by praying mantis-type ETs and physically 
examined. Later, she was taken again, and they told her how they pilot their craft and 
other spiritual information.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME</span>. In June 1978, an anonymous high-ranking Soviet officer 
walked along the shore of Lake Pyrogovskoye in the Soviet Union when he was approached 
by two strange men in jumpsuits. They spoke to him telepathically, requested to speak 
with him, and quickly took him onboard a craft. A long conversation followed as the ETs 
answered all his questions. They gave him a demonstration of their craft and even took 
him to their planet. They returned him to Earth and asked him not to speak about his 
encounter.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">WE ARE ALL BROTHERS</span>. While hunting near his home in Baependi, Brazil, on May 16, 1979, 
Arlindo Gabriel dos Santos was amazed to see a small, strange object land in a nearby 
forest clearing. It was followed by two more. Then a large craft landed, and short 
humanoids emerged. Afraid, Arlindo turned to flee, but found himself being pulled 
onboard. The ETs held a conversation with him, explaining why they were there and 
where they came from. He was then returned. He suffered many physical symptoms. 
Strange landing traces were found at the site.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">WE ARE JUST MEASURING YOU</span>. On the night of May 28, 1991, Susan, a resident of Burien 
Washington, was puzzled by the unexplained barking of her dog. That night, she was 
woken in bed by an eerie blue light streaming through her window. Without warning, 
she found herself lying on a table in a strange room surrounded by gray-type 
extraterrestrials. They gave her a quick physical exam and returned her to her 
bedroom.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">I COULDN’T LOOK AWAY</span>. On the night of September 2, 2021, while cutting wood outside 
his home in Wasilla, Alaska, Andrew was puzzled by the appearance of a shining golden 
object in the sky. He became transfixed and started to receive powerful telepathic 
communication. The object moved lower, and he found himself rising upwards and into 
the craft. Inside, he was greeted by three short gray aliens who told him to stay 
calm and began to examine him. Returned 15 minutes later, he knew his life would 
never be the same again.</p>

<p>While some remain skeptical that people are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft 
and having face-to-face contact with ETs, those who have had this experience don’t have 
the luxury of disbelief. They not only carry the weight of knowing their experiences are 
true but dealing with a society that refuses to accept the reality of ET contact. 
Thankfully things are changing for the better.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">One of the most interesting aspects of the UFO phenomenon are humanoid encounters, and 
there are a lot of them. People across the world report a wide variety of humanoids: 
grays, reptilian creatures, human-looking figures, short humanoids and more. While most 
cases go unreported, there is now a worldwide database of many thousands of encounters, 
many supported by multiple eyewitnesses, medical effects, animal reactions, 
electromagnetic disturbances, landing traces and more. In this video we explore seven 
shocking humanoid encounters. In each case the witnesses were thrust into the unknown 
and confronted with something beyond their imagination.</p>

<p>THE LOVELAND HUMANOIDS. At 3:30 am on May 25, 1955, Robert Hunnicutt was driving home 
when he noticed three odd-looking figures standing by the road in Branch Hill, Ohio. He 
stopped his car and was shocked to see that the figures were not human. They had thin 
misshapen bodies and frog-like faces. They turned to look at him and he froze. The next 
thing he knew, he was racing off to the Loveland police station. Unknown to Robert, 
other people had reported UFOs in the area that same evening. This was the first of 
many humanoid and UFO encounters in the area.</p>

<p>SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS OUT THERE. On the night of November 13, 1967, a young couple drove 
stopped along a forested country road in Surrey, England. Smelling a foul odor, they were 
about to drive off when a strange humanoid appeared next to their car. It had a white 
featureless face and a dark body. The couple drove off in fear. One year later in the 
same area, another young couple experienced a similar encounter. As it turned out, the 
area has a long history of incredible UFO activity and more bizarre humanoid encounters.</p>

<p>I WAS GLUED TO THE GROUND. It was a quiet night on July 22, 1968, at the Pereyra 
Psychiatric Hospital in Mendoza, Argentina as nurse Adela Casalvieri was drawn outside 
by a loud buzzing noise. Stepping into the courtyard, she was immediately struck by a 
red beam of light. The beam retracted and she saw a large craft covered with colored 
lights. Through several portholes she could see humanoid figures moving about. The craft 
darted off, leaving radiation marks on the ground, and burns on Adela’s hands and face. 
Other people saw the craft, and soon many people were reporting UFOs and humanoids.</p>

<p>ETS AT THE ELECTRICAL STATION. On the night of July 23, 1968, security guard Daildo de 
Oliveira was making his rounds at the Central Power Plant in Bauru, Brazil. He noticed 
two men in dark jumpsuits trespassing one of the offices and confronted them. A physical 
fight ensued. A third man appeared, this one dressed in a light jumpsuit. The three 
intruders wrestled Daildo to the ground. Subduing him, they quickly walked off and 
entered a large metallic craft landed on the ground a short distance away. It rose up, 
zigzagged and darted away at high speed.</p>

<p>IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. On the night of July 19, 1972, a young man was playing 
basketball in the barn next to his home in Pioneer, Michigan when he noticed an intense 
ball of swirling light near him. He watched in shock as the light suddenly elongated and 
out stepped a gray alien. The witness felt a strange pressure in his head as the being 
tried to communicate with him telepathically. He ran off and told his mother. Later 
that night, they both saw a UFO while driving, and later, the boy would have a very 
close-up encounter with a UFO.</p>

<p>THIS CREATURE WAS NOT HUMAN. For the past few nights, “Sarah,” had noticed unusual lights 
near her home in rural Clovis, California. On the morning of November 10, 1986, she 
decided to hike out to the area with her dog to investigate. Suddenly an intense fear 
overwhelmed her for no apparent reason. Her dog was mysteriously gone. Turning around, 
she saw a short gray alien staring at her. It lifted its hand and waved at her. Sarah 
ran home and realized she was missing two hours of time. She forgot the event until one 
year later, when she woke up to find a gray alien in her bedroom.</p>

<p>AN ALIEN BESIDE MY BED. In the middle of the night on August 25, 2022, Natalie woke up in 
her bedroom to see a shadowy figure with a huge head standing by her bed, touching her 
knee. It sent a message telling her not to be afraid. With a shock, Natalie realized it 
was an alien. The figure disappeared. Following the encounter, Natalie discovered that 
she was cured of her chronic insomnia. But following this incident, she began to wake up 
with her clothes on wrong and strange marks on her body. Soon she had another encounter.</p>

<p>These seven humanoid encounters provide a tantalizing glimpse into what it’s like to have 
direct contact with extraterrestrials. And yet they are just the tip of the iceberg. The 
truth about ET contact has been covered up for too long. It’s time for all humanity to 
know that there is other life in the universe. And they find humanity of great interest.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">There can be no doubt that the UFO phenomenon is real. Documented reports of UFOs number 
in the many millions. There is much debate about what they are and where they come from, 
but the evidence is overwhelming that they do exist. The same is true for humanoids. Such 
reports are more rare, but the fact that people are seeing humanoids is undeniable. Cases 
come from all over the world and have been reported for more than a hundred years. This 
video presents ten astonishing cases involving a wide variety of humanoids. These ten 
cases alone provide enough data to offer profound insights into the nature of the 
extraterrestrial presence on our planet.</p>

<p>WE CAN’T LET YOU THROUGH. One day in 1930, a woman was driving to her home in Texas when 
she came upon a saucer-shaped craft landed by the road. Standing in the middle of the 
road was a group of odd humanoids. She held a brief conversation with the strange beings 
and continued on her way, arriving home at midnight. She was missing 14 hours of time.</p>

<p>IT DOESN’T MATTER, IT’S A CHILD. One morning in 1945, Julio (age 13) left his home in 
Lavadores, Spain to fetch a pail of water. He had done this many times, but on this 
occasion, upon reaching the fountain, he was confronted by two strange figures. One 
looked much like Jesus Christ and the other a tall gray ET. He dropped the bucket and 
ran.</p>

<p>THE GESTICULATING EXTRATERRESTRIAL. One day in August 1958, a man stepped outside his 
home in rural Paraibo do Sul, Brazil. A shiny craft dropped from the sky and landed 
nearby. A handsome man with long blond hair and fair skin, wearing a skintight jumpsuit, 
emerged and began to communicate using a series of gestures. Unable to make himself 
understood, he re-entered his craft and left.</p>

<p>THE GLINIK HUMANOIDS. One summer day in 1950, Sofia X stepped outside her home in 
Glinik, Poland and saw an odd-looking man standing in a field. Suddenly he levitated 
into the sky and disappeared. Years later, her 6-year-old son saw a bizarre UFO in the 
same exact spot. It turned out that many people in the small village were seeing UFOs 
and many different types of humanoids.</p>

<p>IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. At 7am on February 15, 1963, Charles Brew and his son milked their 
cows on their farm in Moe, Australia. Hearing an odd noise, Charles saw a silvery craft 
emerge from the clouds and hover above a nearby tree. His farm animals scattered, and 
Charles was amazed to see two humanoid figures in a clear dome on the craft. It darted 
away, leaving Charles with a bad headache.</p>

<p>SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED. On the night of July 20, 1968, three teenage girls saw a 
glowing UFO over Lake Kaarnajarv, Estonia. Returning inside, their bedroom filled with 
light, and looking outside they saw a craft hovering nearby. It winked out, but one of 
the girls felt compelled to go outside and saw a female humanoid standing a short 
distance away. Later, weird landing traces were found.</p>

<p>GLOWING ORANGE HUMANOIDS. On the morning of August 24, 1970, three witnesses from 
Olmstead Falls, Ohio, waiting for a bus, saw two humanoids dressed in glowing orange 
jumpsuits and conical hats carrying a strange disc-shaped object over their heads, 
then walk off into a field. Later another witness was found who saw them enter a 
craft. Landing traces were found, and more UFOs were seen in the area.</p>

<p>EYES LIKE BLACK MIRRORS. One night in July 1988, an 8-year-old boy was awoken by 
bright colored lights in his room. Looking outside he saw a strange craft. Suddenly 
the doorway to his room blazed with light and a gray ET appeared. Time seemed to 
stop as two more beings came in and entered his room. As they approached, he 
blacked out. Later he wondered if they had come to cure an ill member of the home.</p>

<p>WE ARE YOUR SISTERS. One summer evening in 1990, a 6-year-old girl woke up when bright 
lights streamed into the bedroom of her home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Suddenly, two 
slender shadowy figures entered her bedroom. They were gray ETs. She was unable to move 
as they communicated with her telepathically and conducted a strange exam. It was an 
encounter that changed her life forever.</p>

<p>THE CHILD-LIKE ETS. On December 12, 1997, Jakov Vrancic tended his sheep outside his 
home in Cvrljevo, Croatia. Hearing an odd buzzing sound, he went to investigate and came 
upon a landed UFO and several child-like humanoids with large heads and gray skin. He 
spoke with them for a few minutes until they returned to the craft which took off. Much 
to his dismay, his case brought him unwanted attention.</p>

<p>These ten cases are just a tiny sample of the growing worldwide database of similar 
encounters. While our govts have now admitted to the validity of UFOs, they have yet to 
acknowledge the many humanoid reports. This is strange because these cases represent the 
cutting edge of UFO research. After all, something or someone is inside UFOs. The 
evidence points towards UFOs being craft piloted by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">Of all types of UFO encounters, the most extensive and profound are cases where people 
are taken onboard a craft and interact with extraterrestrials face-to-face. Thousands of 
these cases from across the planet have been documented, though many researchers believe 
they number in the millions. These cases have the most information and hold the greatest 
potential to answer many of the questions surrounding extraterrestrial contact. This 
video presents seven onboard UFO encounters. These cases involve many different types 
of ETs and they provide a fascinating glimpse into who these beings are, where they come 
from and why they are visiting our planet.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ALBERT LANCASHIRE</span>. One evening in 1942, 27-year-old army 
officer, Albert Lancashire, stood in the guard booth at a secret radar site near 
Newbiggen-by-the Sea, England. Suddenly a light appeared and moved towards him, showing 
itself to be a disc-shaped craft. The craft struck him with a beam of light, and he 
passed out. When he awoke, the craft was gone. This was followed by UFO dreams, 
paranormal events and another UFO sighting. After many years, he recalled being lifted 
into the craft, examined, and then returned.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF PAMELA WIMMER</span>. In 1975, Pamela Wimmer (age 22) was at her 
home in Dresden, Maine when she heard her child scream from the front yard. She ran 
outside and saw a huge saucer-shaped craft. It moved off, but it reminded her that, at 
age 10, she and a friend were chased home by a craft. At age 14, three small grays pulled 
her from her bed, into a craft parked in front of her house. Inside, she was given a 
physical exam, saw weird star-charts, and was shown the Earth floating in space. The ETs 
asked her if she would like to go with them. Pamela declined, and they brought her home.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF SUSAN</span>. In 1968, “Susan,” (age 9) was playing with friends near 
their homes in Port Augusta, South Australia when they saw odd lights hovering overhead. 
One year later, she was in her bedroom in Adelaide when three short figures and one tall 
one arrived and pulled her onboard a craft. She was physically examined. They showed her 
images of a planet experiencing a worldwide disaster. They told her that she had 
important work to do on Earth. This was the first of many encounters, including a few 
involving intimate relations with a tall gray.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROBERLA T</span>. Stepping on to the porch of her Phoenix Arizona 
home on the night of June 23, 1973, Roberla saw a star-like light descending. As it 
approached, she saw it was a strange craft. A door opened and she could see a tall 
humanoid figure. She passed out. Years later, she went under hypnosis and recalled that 
the figure approached her and levitated her into the craft where she was physically 
examined.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF FRANCESCO OJEDA</span>. On March 3, 1976, twelve-year-old Francesco 
Ojeda went missing near his home in rural Fortaleza, Brazil. Two days later, he was found 
by his parents wandering in the forest, burned and unable to see. He recovered his sight. 
He said that while walking home from school, he came upon a landed craft and two small 
humanoids. They entered into the craft which stuck him with a beam of light. He passed 
out and woke up onboard the craft. The ETs examined him, said they meant him no harm, 
and told him that ETs were visiting Earth in large numbers.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DR SIMON TAYLOR &amp; REZA</span>. On September 16, 1976, Simon Taylor 
and his friend Reza went camping tin the Elburz Mountains near Tehran, Iran. In the 
middle of the night they were woken up by three dark-suited figures with large eyes who 
led them into a craft. Inside they sat on a Persian rug while the craft took them on a 
tour around planet Earth. They were returned miles from where they were taken. Both 
were forever changed by their shared encounter.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER UFO ENCOUNTER OF TATIANA MIKHAYLOVONA</span>. Walking to her home in 
Protvino, Russia, on the evening of September 13, 1989, Tatiana Mikhalovona was 
startled by two tall women in silver jumpsuits who approached her. She was unable to 
resist as they led her to a landed flying saucer and took her onboard. They asked if 
she’d like to go for a short ride. Tatiana didn’t want to, but the beings convinced her. 
Tatiana was amazed when she looked out of the porthole of the craft and saw the city 
lights below her. After a 10-minute ride, they returned her to Earth and promised to 
meet her again.</p>

<p>These seven cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but these alone provide an accurate 
representation of what it’s like to be taken onboard an ET craft and meet ETs face-to-
face. There are so many cases with remarkable commonalities, coming from all over the 
world, that they are impossible to deny or explain away. They provide powerful testimony 
that we are being visited by a wide variety of beings from beyond Earth.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown: Episode Twelve,” the ongoing UFO investigative series 
exploring a wide variety of locations on Earth, proving that every town and city on this 
planet has been visited by extraterrestrials. More than 100 locations have been explored, 
and all have a long and rich history of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, humanoids, 
onboard encounters and more are all represented. Name any place on the globe, and you can 
find an encounter there. In this episode we explore nine new locations: Paducah, 
Kentucky; Shakopee, Minnesota; Wilton, Maine; Doncaster, UK; Myrtle Beach, South 
Carolina; Bensalem, Pennsylvania and Brigantine, New Jersey.</p>

<p>PADUCAH, KENTUCKY. In 1957, two men saw a UFO which caused their car to stall. In 1993, a 
family saw three metallic UFOs circling over their home. In 2005, a man saw a huge black 
triangle at very low elevation. In 2008, a young man saw a classic flying saucer right 
outside his window, an encounter which triggered profound changes in his life.</p>

SHAKOPEE, MINNESOTA. In 2005 and 2013, two separate encounters occurred while the 
witnesses drove along the freeway and saw craft overhead. In 2015, a witness observed a 
brilliant object overhead and managed to capture a photograph of it. In broad daylight 
in 2006, a man saw a massive bell-shaped craft far too large to be any conventional 
craft.</p>

<p>WILTON, MAINE. On October 16, 2004, a mother noticed a strange static interference on 
her baby monitor. Going outside, she was amazed to see a string of colored lights 
hovering over the field behind her house. Her husband saw it too, and both became so 
uneasy, they fled inside.</p>

<p>DONCASTER, UNITED KINGDOM. In 1975, three boys saw a UFO so low, they thought it would 
land. In 1975, a family saw a UFO hover in the field behind their home. In 1980, 1988, 
1997 and 1998 each produced high quality UFO sightings that researchers couldn’t explain. 
In one case the UFO was so low, the witness could smell it.</p>

<p>MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA. In 1952, a man saw a UFO over his farm and shot it with his 
gun. Days later, a reporter and his family saw apparently the same craft. In 1975, a man 
saw a classic saucer flying along the shoreline in broad daylight. In 2013, a couple saw 
a UFO after a fireworks display. In 2017 and 2022, two cases involved photographic evidence.</p>

<p>PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. In 1949, a pilot reported a near-miss with a UFO. In 1956, 
there were two cases of very unusual lights over the city. In 1966, two men reported a 
craft landing in front of their car and a face-to-face encounter with the UFO occupant. 
That same year, there was a UFO display involving a fleet of seven saucers. In 1978, 
more than a dozen police officers and hundreds of citizens saw UFOs.</p>

<p>MACON, GEORGIA. In 1950, the military dismissed eyewitness reports of speeding white 
objects in the night sky. In 1951, a military pilot encountered a UFO which played 
cata-and-mouse games with his aircraft for more than 10 minutes. One year later, 
multiple pilots saw a UFO by their planes. In 1955, there were at least two sightings 
of strange craft overhead. In 1957, three truck drivers encountered an egg-shaped 
object on the highway. In 1958 there was a sighting directly over Robin AFB. And one 
year later in 1959, more than 500 people reported unusual lights in the sky. In 1973, 
a woman reported her encounter with a landed UFO and strange beings in the forest 
outside of Macon. And in 1973, a rash of sightings involved more than a dozen police 
officers who were vehement that they had seen UFOs. Sightings continued in 2018 and 
2019.</p>

<p>BENSALEM, PENNSYLVANIA. A very interesting case in Bensalem involved a couple who, in 
1973, saw a boomerang-shaped craft and moments later, a dogman-like creature. In 1975, 
a man photographed a UFO almost identical to a photo published by J. Allen Hynek. In 
1977, a family had a prolonged encounter with a classic flying saucer which resulted 
in direct contact. Another case in 1989 involved a witness who himself was a UFO 
investigator.</p>

<p>BRIGANTINE, NEW JERSEY. In 1953, a man saw a mothership come over the water and release 
several smaller craft. In 2015, a man had so many encounters with strange orbs, he 
finally was able to capture them on video. In 2019, a man saw a massive craft over the 
town which was nearly invisible in the night sky.</p>

<p>So many locations, so many cases, and so many firsthand eyewitnesses! The deeper you 
look, the more cases you find. The truth is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere 
on this planet. And the implications of this are profound. It means that UFO encounters 
are far more common than previously believed. It means that UFOs are apparently 
conducting a vigorous publicity campaign announcing their presence. And most important 
of all, it means that we are not alone, and UFOs are real!</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">Welcome to Episode Eleven of the ongoing series: UFOs in Your Hometown. This series was 
born from a challenge: name any town, city or location on this planet, and I will find at 
least one UFO encounter there. With nearly 100 locations explored from across the planet, 
every single one shows a long, rich history of UFO encounters of all kinds: sightings, 
landings, humanoids, onboard cases and more. We now explore four new locations: Vancouver, 
BC, Canada; Lake Havasu, Arizona; Thomasville, North Carolina and Isle of Wight, United 
Kingdom. All types of encounters are represented, along with a wide variety of evidence: 
medical effects, landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, radar-
returns, photographs and more. So come along on a journey that is sure to change the 
way you feel about the UFO phenomenon.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA. In 1912, a farm-boy came upon a landed UFO with humanoids. In 1933, 
after a wave of sightings, witnesses observed an apparent UFO crash and alien bodies. Year 
after year, Vancouver has sightings of solid metallic craft, in 1939, 1955, 1964, 1968 and 
more. In 1968, a group of boys came upon a landed UFO and a humanoid on a golf course. In 
1970, a man describes his encounter with a fleet of tiny UFOs. In 1977, a mother and 
daughter saw a flying saucer hover right over a church. That same year, two weather 
observers at Vancouver Int’l Airport saw a huge craft with portholes. In 1978, neighbors 
saw a closeup UFO hover over their homes. In 1985, a classroom of students and a teacher 
saw a strange craft hover over the schoolyard. In 1990, a child saw a gray ET in his hotel 
room. In 1997, a woman’s sighting of a craft drew the attention of NORAD. That same year, 
a lady and her grandson had a dramatic encounter with a hamburger-shaped UFO. In 2000, 
two amateur astronomers were shocked by their sighting of a V-shaped craft. In April and 
May of 2001, two brothers had three close-up sightings; one of the witnesses had telepathic 
communication. More dramatic sightings of metallic discs occurred in 2001 and 2003. In 2015, 
a Vancouver woman reported her encounter with a strange humanoid in her bedroom.</p>

<p>LAKE HAVASU, ARIZONA. In 1968, a daylight disc was seen directly over Lake Havasu. The 
best-known sighting in this area occurred in 1968 when two Cessna pilots saw dozens of 
craft performing fantastic maneuvers. In 1994, a woman and her child had an encounter 
with a massive UFO over their house. They could see humanoids through the portholes. 
When the humanoids entered their house, they packed up and moved away.  In 1996, a 
group of witnesses saw a glowing green craft, resulting in missing time. More amazing 
cases of solid craft encounters occurred in 2000, 2005 and 2006. In 2009, a witness 
videotaped a solid metallic disc hovering over Lake Havasu in broad daylight. In 2010, 
an entire family observed a UFO being chased by military jet aircraft. This is just a 
small sample of UFOs seen over the Lake Havasu area, proving once again that UFOs are 
seen everywhere.</p>

<p>THOMASVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1965 a man had a very close encounter with a cylindrical 
craft hovering only 200 feet above the ground. One night in 1969, two independent 
witnesses pulled off the road to observe a classic flying saucer hover over the nearby 
trees. When a strange humanoid appeared in one of the windows, they drove off in a panic. 
Arriving home, one of the witnesses realized he was missing about 45 minutes of time. 
One night in 1996, a man was driving along the road when he saw a UFO sending down a 
beam of light in the field next to him. Soon the UFO zoomed towards him, coming directly 
over his vehicle. In 1998, a father and son fishing on a lake had a very close encounter 
with a silver spherical craft. So many cases!</p>

<p>ISLE OF WIGHT, UNITED KINGDOM. So many cases here. In 1952, an RAF radarman tracked 8 
objects flying over the Isle of Wight. In 1954, a UFO was seen over a wide area. In 1956 
two jet fighter pilots chased a UFO along the coast, catching it on radar. In 1959, a 
group of 8 amateur astronomers observed 5 “mystery satellites.” In 1961, a mother and 
daughter had a very close encounter with a metallic disc. In 1967, a group of students 
saw a wobbling UFO behind their school, leaving behind landing traces. In 1970, a man 
had a series of sightings. Three years later, his daughter and a friend had a bizarre 
humanoid encounter with the “Sandown Clown,” destined to become the area’s most famous 
case. Over the next decades, year after year, many other sightings occurred, some which 
were investigated by the Royal Air Force.</p>

<p>So many cases of all kinds. The ubiquitous nature of UFOs cannot be denied. If every 
location on this planet has truly been visited by UFOs, the implications of this are 
profound. UFOs appear to be putting on a publicity campaign announcing their presence. 
The ETs have done their part to disclose. The rest is up to us.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">Being taken onboard a UFO! It is the ultimate type of UFO encounter, the most extensive, 
and the most controversial. There are thousands of cases on record. These cases have the 
greatest potential to answer the many questions surrounding the extraterrestrial presence 
on our planet, such as who are these strange visitors, where do they come from and why 
are they here? This video presents five little known cases coming from all over the world. 
In each of these cases, the witnesses held long conversations with the extraterrestrials. 
Each of these cases was investigated by researchers. The five cases here add to the 
growing database of close encounters of the fourth kind, making it increasingly undeniable 
that we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">TIME DOESN’T EXIST</span>. One night in April 1970, lawyer, Raymond Shearer, (pseudonym) was 
driving outside Madison, Wisconsin and saw a light over his car. He felt compelled to 
turn off on a remote road and came upon an ET craft. Suddenly, it was morning, and he 
was arriving home. Beset with anxiety, he visited a therapist. Making no progress, the 
therapist tried hypnosis, and recalled that he was taken onboard a craft by human-
looking ETs who examined him and said that humans do not understand the nature of time, 
how they fly their craft, that humans are too warlike for open contact, and that the 
ETs have lost some of their people to conflicts with humans. They talked about the 
power of water and many other topics, including advising Raymond about his career.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS</span>. On February 28, 1974, Dirant Mello Ferraz (age 18) was in his home 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when he was pulled into a craft. Onboard, he met a twin of 
himself who departed the craft and took Dirant’s place for a full 24-hours, learning 
all he could about life on Earth. Meanwhile Dirant was kept onboard. He asked the ETs 
many questions, which they answered, about why they chose him, what their mission on 
Earth was, would they invade our planet, did they believe in God, and much more. They 
asked him to tell the people of Earth that they are friendly and that it is their 
mission to help humanity. After 24 hours, Dirant was returned to his home. Dirant’s 
case was thoroughly researched, but afterward, he just wanted to forget about the 
encounter and live a normal life.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AREN’T READY</span>. On December 25, 1976, an anonymous teacher, “Francisco,” 
was hunting outside of Merida, Spain when he became tired and fell asleep. Waking up, it 
was night, and he realized a weird tentacle-like device was pulling on his arm. To his 
shock, it was attached to a strange craft a short distance away. He fainted and when 
he awoke, he thought he was in a hospital. But when big-eyed, scaly-skinned creatures 
entered, he realized he was inside a craft. After examining him, they gave him a tour 
of the craft, showed him an alien arboretum, and fed him strange alien foods. They 
said they were on a benevolent scientific expedition to study Earth, that their 
culture is far older than ours, that humans are not ready for contact, and that it 
was his duty to tell the world about them.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF MATTER</span>. At 9pm on September 20, 1979, two men in Sztum, 
Poland were shocked to see a UFO hover overhead. Suddenly they found themselves flying 
upward into the craft. Inside, each held telepathic conversations with unseen entities 
who talked on various topics such as mathematics, physics, the nature of matter and more. 
Suddenly they were deposited back onto the ground and watched the craft dart away. Both 
men had severe headaches. They tried to share their experience with friends, who 
ridiculed them. Later, their case was extensively studied, and it was learned that one 
year earlier, another truly remarkable encounter had occurred in the same area.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">WE WON’T DO YOU ANY HARM</span>. On the night of January 12, 2008, the Voronezhsky family were 
puzzled by the appearance of strange lights above their home in Dubno, Ukraine. Going 
to bed, they were awakened in the middle of the night by a light illuminating their home. 
Rushing outside, they saw a giant craft overhead. Suddenly the parents, Vladimir and 
Olga, were pulled up into the craft. Vladimir was unable to move as his wife was 
examined. The gray-type ETs were very polite as they told the couple about ET society, 
and their interest in human emotions. They said that they were able to travel great 
distances, turn their ships invisible and much more. They gave the couple a tour through 
space and then returned them home. Vladimir discovered he had greater strength and 
endurance, and Olga was healed of colitis.</p>

<p>Five onboard experiences, each with amazing similarities and unique details, each 
providing further evidence of extraterrestrial intervention on planet Earth. It is 
unknown exactly how many people have had an experience like this, but some researchers 
believe it may number in the millions.</p>

<p class="tallFirstLetter">One of the interesting things about encounters with strange beings is that they are 
humanoid in form, bipedal beings that look much like us, but are clearly not human. The 
humanoid form seems to be the universal template. This is what the first-hand accounts 
are showing us. There are thousands of cases, going back more than 100 years, coming 
from all over the world. Midget-like ETs, tall beings, grays, robotic creatures, mantids, 
human-looking and more. This video presents 12 cases, each showing the variety and the 
unique high-strangeness aspects of face-to-face encounters with humanoids.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">WE COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET</span>. One evening in the summer of 
1957, a woman awoke in the bedroom of her home in Jutland, Denmark to see three 2-foot-tall 
humanoids come through the closed window. Each looked identical, with beautiful human-
looking faces and kind eyes. They said they came from a different planet and promptly left.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">ETS LAND AT FARMHOUSE</span>. One day in October 1957, a farmer and 
his workers saw a flying saucer land on his farm in Campinas, Brazil. Three human-looking 
figures exited and went to collect water from the river. They returned to their craft, 
which took off. Many odd effects were found, landing traces, EM disturbances, metal 
fragments, and more witnesses.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">EXTRATERRESTRIAL TOURISTS?</span> One night in October 1959, Mrs. 
Moulet and her three children stepped out of their home in Aubagne, France to hang the 
laundry. Suddenly an egg-shaped craft hovered overhead. Through a big porthole, they 
saw 20 blond men in white shirts looking down smiling at them. Soon, the craft zoomed 
off.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE LITTLE GREEN MAN OF LUUMAKI</span>. On August 19, 1965 and the 
Kuningas family went berry-picking in the fields out of Hermunen in Luumaki, Finland. A 
3-foot-tall humanoid appeared. It had red skin, a human-looking face, and wore a tight 
green jumpsuit. The father and son were unable to move as the being approached, then 
ran off into the woods.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">IF I HADN’T SEEN IT MYSELF, I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONVINCED</span>. 
One night in February 1968, a couple looked out of their home in Greensburg, Pennsylvania 
to see a saucer-shaped craft over their backyard pond. To their shock, they saw a humanoid 
figure standing on a railing outside the craft looking down at them. They called their 
relatives who drove over and saw the craft.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">SIX ALIENS ON BEENLEIGH ROAD</span>. At 2am on July 19, 1972, a man 
drove to work along the Beenleigh Road, in Kuraby, Queensland, Australia. Suddenly he saw 
six humanoid figures in cream-colored jumpsuits and diamond-like faceplates standing next 
to the road. Nearby, a large craft hovered. He drove off in fear and vowed to never drive 
that road again.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE MAN WAVED BACK</span>. Driving along a remote road in Covington, 
Michigan, one night in September 1973, a man was shocked to see a UFO hover over the car 
ahead of him. The car stopped, and the lady knelt down to pray. The man saw a blond man 
looking at him through a porthole. He waved, and the man waved back, and the craft zipped 
away.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A PRESSURE INSIDE HIS HEAD</span>. At 10pm on January 6, 1978, two 
men were walked along a street in Santo Antonio da Caparico, Portugal when a light zoomed 
overheard. They ran to get a closer look and saw by a 7-foot-tall being in a glowing white 
jumpsuit. They fled in panic. Later, landing traces were found and one of the men suffered 
weird effects.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE CREATURES IN THE WOODS</span>. On April 27, 1986, a karate teacher 
and his student went jogging in the woods by Gravina di Puglia, Italy. Seeing two 7-foot-tall 
figures in white uniforms, they ran and called the police. They soon learned that three hunters 
also saw the beings. The police found odd marks on the ground where the beings had stood.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">“WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO HURT ME?”</span> For days, “Lee” of Gary, Indiana 
had a feeling of being watched. Then on the night of June 15, 1986, he awoke to see a gray 
alien standing next to his bed. Afraid, he threw a pillow at it. The gray looked at him and 
asked, “Why are you trying to hurt me?” Lee felt great love coming from the being, who promptly 
vanished.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">IT’S NOT HUMAN</span>. One night in October 2010, two men were walking 
along the foothills of the mountains in Tandil, Argentina when they saw a strange light. 
Getting closer, they saw it was a glowing humanoid, wearing a clear helmet. When it started 
to levitate, they turned and ran. To their shock, it began to follow them.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ALIEN AND THE SQUIRRELS</span>. One morning in December 2012, a 
couple looked outside their home in Villaviciosa de Odon, Spain and were shocked to see 
200 squirrels on their porch. Then they saw a 9-foot-tall humanoid in a red jumpsuit 
floating in their backyard. After 15 minutes, it departed, and the squirrels dispersed.</p>

<p>Twelve cases, each showing the familiar humanoid form, yet each with  unique details. 
These cases make it clear that something profound is happening here, and that we still 
have much to understand about these visitors to our planet.</p>

UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE TEN</a>.</h3>
<h5>LINK: https://youtu.be/kgCSWrY9DrA</h5>   <span class="seeDate">April 25, 2025</span>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Welcome to Episode Ten of UFOs in Your Hometown. The challenge continues: name any 
town or city in the world, and I will find a UFO encounter there! This includes sighting, 
landings, humanoids and onboard encounters. It appears that the UFO occupants are 
conducting a carefully orchestrated and vigorous publicity campaign, visiting every 
location on Earth, in an apparent attempt to announce their presence. In this latest 
installment, we explore four new locations: Slovakia; Covington, Kentucky, Chicago, 
Illinois and Sarasota, Florida. These four locations alone represent a microcosm of UFO 
activity, containing enough cases to provide an accurate representation of the UFO 
phenomenon. There are cases with multiple witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, 
animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, photographs, radar returns, and more. 
So come along on a journey that is sure to change the way you feel about UFOs.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">SLOVAKIA</span>: In 1944, a physician observed a fleet of 8 UFO. In 1959, Air Force officers 
and airport employees viewed an object hover over an airfield and was caught on radar. 
In December 1967, many people in the small village of Myjava saw a UFO appeared directly 
above the local church. In 1971, three people were taken from their apartment to what 
they believed to be another planet. Slovakia’s most famous encounter occurred in 1987 
when a helicopter crew chased a UFO over the Vranov reservoir. In 1997, the residents of 
the small town of Milicin were panicked by a very intense wave of encounters. In 1991 
and 1992, more sightings were viewed by police and caught on radar. The years of 1993 
and 1994 were particularly active, with landings, multiple face-to-face encounters with 
humanoids and a gentleman whose car was levitated into the sky. In 2005 and 2006, 
multiple low-level sightings over the Bohunice and Temelin Nuclear power stations 
caused concern at high levels of government.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">COVINGTON, KENTUCKY</span>. In July 1947, residents observed a UFO with landing legs flying 
at very low elevation over the city. In 1956, a pilot had no less than three encounters. 
In 1959, police were flooded with calls about a UFO and a strange creature. In 1975, a 
gentleman in a high-rise building watched a UFO fly around his building. In 1976, a UFO 
hovered over the suburb, sending down a beam of light. In 1978, people across the city 
described a glowing green object, and some reported seeing it land. In 1985, police 
across Covington saw a UFO which was also caught on radar. In 2017, a Covington resident 
reported an object which hovered for hours, causing a bizarre electromagnetic 
disturbance in his home.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</span>. Numerous low-level sightings occurred in 1952, including one viewed 
by police over two radio towers. In 1954, witnesses observed a UFO hover and then land on 
the shores of Lake Michigan, disgorging a small humanoid. 1954 produced several other 
cases, including a low-level sighting over an oil refinery. In 1957, policemen saw a UFO 
hovering directly over a cemetery. 1963 brought sightings of classic UFOs with portholes 
moving only a few hundred feet overhead and seen by hundreds of people. In 1965, a man 
walking along the shores of Lake Michigan came upon a landed UFO with a little spaceman 
standing next to it. Dramatic and widely viewed sightings occurred regularly, in 1966, 
1973, 1978-79, and 1988. In 1990, a witness reported a low-level encounter with a craft 
that caused odd physiological effects. In 1999, a man was visited in his home by a 
7-foot-tall mantid.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">SARASOTA, FLORIDA</span>. In 1952, a UFO skeptic changed his tune when a UFO zigzagged over 
his home. In 1953, two men had saw a UFO following several B36 aircraft, and then zoom 
towards them and hover overhead. In January 1954, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, 
MacKinley Kantor saw a UFO and took it to the highest levels of government. The years 
of 1957, 1958 and 1960 brought many undeniable UFO encounters over the city. In 1969, 
and again in 1976, waves of activity were viewed by many residents who were left with 
no explanation for what they saw. In 1985, authorities were flooded with calls as a 
wave of activity occurred over the city, with some seeing an object diving into the 
bay. In 1995, a pilot and his passenger flying in their Cessna reported a near-collision 
with a bright glowing object. In 1995, residents of a home on the outskirts of Sarasota 
discovered a strange glowing stone in their yard, which ended up causing severe 
repercussions. In 1999 and 2005, witnesses driving through the area saw UFOs at treetop 
level moving overhead. In 2022, a man not only saw a fleet of 8 disc-shaped objects, 
he took photographs!</p>

<p>As can be seen, UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen all over this planet. This is 
important as it reveals that the ETs appear to have an agenda to announce their presence 
to all humanity. The ETs have done their part to disclose their presence. The rest is up 
to us!</p>

THE SPACESHIP HOUSE</a>.</h3>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Joe Gardner (an artist from Huntington, West Virginia) was five years old when he had 
his first strange encounter. It was 1974 and he and his mother stood in the parking lot 
of the local Foodland grocery store. Suddenly Joe heard a singsong voice speak s in his 
mind, “Joe-Joe. Joe-Joe.” Looking up he saw a shiny metallic cylindrical object floating 
overhead. He pointed it out to his mother who also saw it. So began Joe’s life of high 
strangeness. Following this, he and his entire family had a dramatic missing time 
encounter with a landed UFO. A few years later, Joe had another onboard encounter. But 
for various reasons, both these events became buried in his mind and shrouded in 
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Years later, on January 22, 1997, Joe (now 22) had a dramatic sighting of a green orb 
arcing across the pre-dawn sky. Two years later, on the night of April 7, 1999, he was 
walking his dog when a glittering diamond-shaped object appeared. Joe sent out a 
telepathic message, “Who are you?” The response was instantaneous: “No, not now!” Joe 
felt an overwhelming sense of love coming from the object. These two sightings sent Joe 
on a journey of awakening and discovery. It was then that he remembered the sighting 
at age five, and the two other major experiences that followed.</p>

<p>It was just a few months after the sighting at the Foodland grocery store that Joe’s 
family (father, mother, sister and Joe) went for a blackberry hunting trip into nearby 
Kentucky. It was early afternoon, and they drove along the backroads when Joe’s father 
pointed out a weird-looking “spaceship house” sitting on stilts a few hundred feet off 
the highway. It was shiny, metallic, with portholes around the circumference. Joe begged 
his father to stop. They pulled off the road. Joe’s father and Joe got out and walked 
up to the object. There was no driveway, no telephone wires. Joe’s father knocked on 
the side of it, and suddenly an opening appeared, an arm stuck and gestured, and voice 
said, “Up here!” At the time of the incident, the next thing Joe and his father knew, 
they were back in the car, driving home. But now, years later, Joe recalled that they 
actually went onboard.</p>

<p>A small ladder came down and Joe and his father climbed up into the object. Joe 
immediately saw a humanoid figure with a large bald head, huge darks eyes and a skinny 
body. He looked more like a bug than a human, though his father didn’t seem to notice. 
While the man and Joe’s father talked, the being motioned Joe to a table where there 
were small black wafers and a tumbler filled with green liquid. Joe thought it was 
chocolate cookies and juice and took a bite of the cookie. It was bitter, so he took a 
sip of the juice and promptly passed out.</p>

<p>Joe awoke to find himself lying on a metal table while his father sat on a small 
bench, apparently in a trance. An unpleasant physical exam followed, and again, Joe 
lost consciousness. He awoke to see a tall gray-type ET, who asked Joe if he’d like a 
tour of the craft. Joe was taken to another room where he saw his family sitting 
unmoving in separate chairs, with all kinds of activity going on around them. Becoming 
upset, the gray told him, telepathically, not to be afraid, that it was just a checkup. 
Reassured, the being then took Joe up to a room where he saw a field of stars.</p>

<p>Joe’s next memory is being in the car driving home. His whole family was upset. His 
father cursed angrily, and both his mother and sister were crying. When they arrived home, 
they discovered they were missing almost ten hours. Joe was the only one who had some 
recall of being taken onboard. After a visit by a Man in Black, Joe’s father forbade him 
to talk about it ever again.</p>

<p>Three years later, at age eight, Joe woke up in his bedroom to hear his name being 
called inside his head. Looking outside, he saw a landed craft with a man on top. “Do 
you want to go for a ride?” the man asked telepathically. Joe said yes, and he snuck 
out of the house into the craft. He was met by a human-looking man in a jumpsuit who 
took him to the control room, sat him in the seat and off they went, up over the city, 
over the earth, and the next thing Joe knew, he was looking at the planet Saturn. The 
experience was entirely benevolent. Returning Joe to his home, the man urged Joe to 
study hard at school and tell nobody about the encounter.</p>

<p>Now, as an adult, Joe began having many close-up UFO sightings and was able to take 
photographs of a few of them. He learned his mom had a missing time encounter. He 
experienced a wide variety of paranormal events, including another episode of telepathic 
communication. Then on April 3, 2007, Joe had a truly bizarre encounter with a blue-
skinned humanoid that changed his entire outlook about his experiences, and he wondered 
if perhaps they weren’t ETs at all, but more akin to Djinns.</p>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>The general public has no idea how common humanoid encounters are. There are not hundreds 
of cases, but many thousands, perhaps more than that. Cases go back more than 100 years 
and come from across the world. The coverup is one reason cases like these are thought 
of as rare. Another is that an encounter with a humanoid can be so strange that people 
are reluctant to report it for fear of being disbelieved or ridiculed. Still, many people 
have found the courage to come forward. Almost everything we know about UFOs and ETs 
comes from these reports. This episode presents twelve cases from 1940-2013, occurring 
across the planet, involving a wide variety of humanoids.</p>
 
<p>TALL HUMANOIDS IN GLOWING METALLIC OUTFITS. Sometime in the early 1940s, police sergeant 
Vicente Pedone was stationed in Oriente, Buenos Aires, Argentina when a local resident 
reported a strange aircraft seemingly coming in for a crash-landing. Going to 
investigate, they saw a landed craft with tall humanoids next to it. Fear soon 
caused them to flee the scene.</p>

<p>THE CLOUDED CRAFT. Early one night in 1952, a group of stoneworkers near the Nimes-
Courbessac Airport in France saw a strange cloud approach. In moments, it revealed itself 
to be a solid metallic craft with portholes. And through the portholes they saw 5 or 6 
figures inside. The craft darted away, again hidden by clouds. Other people saw the 
object too.</p>

<p>A UFO DRIVE-BY, WITH HUMANOIDS. One night in October 1957, a couple driving through the 
Store Vildmose Bog near Aalborg, Denmark saw a bright light zooming towards them just 
above the ground. In moments, it was right next to them. They now saw it was a craft 
with a glass-like dome on top, and seated inside were two uniformed men. Afraid, the 
wife insisted they flee.</p>

<p>THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE PEOPLE…BUT THEY WEREN’T. At 9pm on December 18, 1977, Bruno 
Nygard was walking to his home in Sahavaara, Sweden and saw a strange craft floating 
above the road. As it approached, he saw two short men sitting on top. The two men 
hopped off and began picking up things from the road. Seeing Bruno, they hopped back 
onto their ship and zoomed off.</p>

<p>IT WAS NOT HUMAN. On the night of August 7, 1979, two women driving near Duluth, Minnesota 
saw three short figures on the road ahead of them. They appeared at first to be children. 
Then two seemed to float off the road, but the third stood in the road, blocking their 
way. The witnesses stopped their car and stared in shock: it was not human. After 10 
scary minutes, they drove off.</p>

<p>NINE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS. On February 12, 1980, during a wave of sightings near 
Algeciras, Spain, a couple and three children drove up to where the lights were 
being seen. They came upon a landed UFO and two 9-foot-tall humanoids. When the 
figures began to approach, they fled in their car. To their shock, the figures 
chased them in their car.</p>

<p>REALLY SCARED, BUT ALSO CURIOUS. One summer evening in 1981, a woman was driving 
to her home in rural Utah when her car broken down. Walking the remaining 2 miles 
home, a UFO flew over her head then landed in the road in front of her. Out 
stepped a little man. She approached and waved at the being. A bright light 
flashed, and she fainted. When she awoke, the craft and humanoid were gone.</p>

<p>IT WAS GONE WITHIN SECONDS. In August 1983, a wave of UFO activity struck central Puerto 
Rico. Many people had close-up sightings of strange craft. Among the strangest was a man 
who saw a pyramid-shaped object. It had windows on one side, and looking down at him were 
three humanoids.</p>

<p>MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOID. One spring day in 1984, a young boy was walking through a 
field near his home in Vancouver, Washington when he came upon a 3-foot-wide metallic 
disc with a clear dome on top. Inside it was a tiny humanoid. The boy picked up the 
craft, which emitted a buzzing noise, broke free from his grip and darted off into the sky.</p>
 
<p>WHAT I SAW WAS FOUR FEET TALL. Late one night on March 20, 1997, a man from Port Perry, 
Ontario, Canada, was shocked to see grays inside his home. They had skinny bodies and 
looked reptilian. One moved its arms up and down in slow motion. The man thinks he may 
have had missing time.</p>

<p>WE CAN FIND YOU. One night in mid-January 2007, a man stepped out from his work in New 
Orleans, Louisiana for a quick smoke. He heard an odd beeping noise. Then a strange fear 
filled him and looking up, he saw a gray entity floating in the sky above him.</p>

<p>THE GRAY IN THE BEDROOM. On April 11, 2013, a woman entered her parents’ bedroom in 
Catania, Italy, and saw her mother levitating and a gray standing next to her. Filled 
with fear, she ran into the bathroom and locked the door. Soon other odd events began 
to occur.</p>

<p>Twelve cases, each adding to the growing database of human encounters, each making it 
increasingly difficult to deny the truth of the UFO phenomenon. Sooner or later, all 
humanity will become aware that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

Minnesota saw three short figures on the road ahead of them. They appeared at first to 
be children. Then two seemed to float off the road, but the third stood in the road, 
blocking their way. The witnesses stopped their car and stared in shock: it was not 
human. After 10 scary minutes, they drove off.</p>

<p>NINE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS. On February 12, 1980, during a wave of sightings near 
Algeciras, Spain, a couple and three children drove up to where the lights were being 
seen. They came upon a landed UFO and two 9-foot-tall humanoids. When the figures 
began to approach, they fled in their car. To their shock, the figures chased them 
in their car.</p>

<p>REALLY SCARED, BUT ALSO CURIOUS. One summer evening in 1981, a woman was driving to 
her home in rural Utah when her car broken down. Walking the remaining 2 miles home, a 
UFO flew over her head then landed in the road in front of her. Out stepped a little 
man. She approached and waved at the being. A bright light flashed, and she fainted. 
When she awoke, the craft and humanoid were gone.</p>

<p>IT WAS GONE WITHIN SECONDS. In August 1983, a wave of UFO activity struck central 
Puerto Rico. Many people had close-up sightings of strange craft. Among the strangest 
was a man who saw a pyramid-shaped object. It had windows on one side, and looking 
down at him were three humanoids.</p>

<p>MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOID. One spring day in 1984, a young boy was walking through a field near his home in Vancouver, Washington when he came upon a 3-foot-wide metallic disc with a clear dome on top. Inside it was a tiny humanoid. The boy picked up the craft, which emitted a buzzing noise, broke free from his grip and darted off into the sky.</p>
 
<p>WHAT I SAW WAS FOUR FEET TALL. Late one night on March 20, 1997, a man from Port Perry, Ontario, Canada, was shocked to see grays inside his home. They had skinny bodies and looked reptilian. One moved its arms up and down in slow motion. The man thinks he may have had missing time.</p>

<p>WE CAN FIND YOU. One night in mid-January 2007, a man stepped out from his work in New Orleans, Louisiana for a quick smoke. He heard an odd beeping noise. Then a strange fear filled him and looking up, he saw a gray entity floating in the sky above him.</p>

<p>THE GRAY IN THE BEDROOM. On April 11, 2013, a woman entered her parents’ bedroom in Catania, Italy, and saw her mother levitating and a gray standing next to her. Filled with fear, she ran into the bathroom and locked the door. Soon other odd events began to occur.</p>

<p>Twelve cases, each adding to the growing database of human encounters, each making it increasingly difficult to deny the truth of the UFO phenomenon. Sooner or later, all humanity will become aware that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN: EPISODE NINE</a>.</h3>
<h5>LINK: https://youtu.be/GSlGs6yh2Fg</h5>   <span class="seeDate">March 28, 2025</span>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>Welcome to Episode Nine of UFOs in Your Hometown. Name any town or city on this 
planet, and you will find a history of UFOs. So far I have examined almost 100 
locations, and every single one of them has been visited by UFOs. The implications 
of this are profound; this shows that UFO encounters are far more common than previously 
believed. It appears that the UFO occupants are conducting a  publicity campaign and 
want to be seen. This latest episode of the ongoing series presents nine new locations 
including: Katwijk, Holland; Nanjing, China; Pakistan; Quapaw, Oklahoma; Salinas, 
California; Dubque, Iowa; Daytona Beach, Florida; Statesville, North Carolina; and 
Annadale, New York. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters and more…they are 
occurring everywhere on Earth.</p>

<p>KATWIJK, HOLLAND. This small town of about twelve square miles has a couple of very 
interesting encounters. At 3:30 am on July 8, 2003, a woman noticed a spinning disc-
shaped craft over her home. It remained in place for an hour. Afterwards, she had a 
terrible headache. On September 2, 2023, a witness not only saw a UFO, but photographed 
and filmed it.</p>

<p>NANJING, CHINA. One of Nanjing’s earliest sightings occurred in 1892 and was widely-
viewed and memorialized in a painting. In 1999, a glowing red cylindrical object hovered 
for four hours over the city. In 2002, three separate pilots witnessed an unidentified 
craft moving through the skies. In 2009, during a solar eclipse, scientists observed 
and photographed a glowing object.</p>

<p>PAKISTAN. In 1952, the Reuters News Service reported on a sighting in Karachi 
involving four flying saucers. Per a CIA document, UFOs were seen in 1953. In 1955, 
UFOs hovered over an airport. Also in 1955, thousands of witnesses who saw a craft 
with humanoids inside it. A sighting of a bright red disc occurred in 1956, and in 
1969, Army intelligence officers in Peshawar saw three discs in the sky. They were 
sworn to silence. In 1986 a group of witnesses saw 8 objects. In 2002, Pakistani 
pilots had a close encounter with a UFO.</p>

<p>QUAPAW, OKLAHOMA. This tiny town is well-known for mysterious spook-lights. It also 
has UFO encounters. In 1972, a couple witnessed three UFOs hover over their home for 
over an hour. In 2006, a witness driving through Quapaw saw a silver cigar-shaped object 
hover and dart off at high speed. In 2014, a witness saw a UFO so close, he heard it 
humming.</p>

<p>SALINAS, CALIFORNIA. In 1945, an army officer  at Salinas Army Airbase saw three 
flying disks. In 1947, a farmer saw a metallic disc-shaped craft in his field. It was 
quickly nabbed by the US military. In 1950, a mini-wave caused many people to call the 
police. In 1950 and 1952, a UFO hovered over two different factories. In 1967, a couple 
saw a  disc with portholes. In 1972, a man saw a gigantic UFO which prompted memories 
of being visited by humanoids. 1978 brought a multi-witness case of UFOs over the 
airport; a 7-year-old who saw a UFO and had missing time; five boys who had a close-up 
sighting; and a landing of a UFO at a high school. Cases in 1981 and 2002 involved 
communication with the UFO occupants. In 2013, a filmed UFO sighting and crop circle 
brought wide publicity. More sightings occurred in 2014 and in 2019, a weird humanoid 
encounter.</p>

<p>DUBUQUE, IOWA. So many cases here! In 1880, a woman claimed a bizarre encounter with 
fairies. In 1947, a couple saw metallic discs over their home. In 1952, a man had an 
odd encounter while driving outside the city. In 1960, a pilot filmed three UFOs over 
Dubuque. Many others saw the objects. In 1967 two families saw an egg-shaped craft. 
More sightings occurred in 1972, 1977 and 1982. In 1996, a teenage boy had a closeup 
UFO sighting and missing time. 2002 brought two more sightings, including one by two 
pilots.</p>

<p>DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA. Sightings of metallic discs occurred in 1950 and 1952. In 
1957, a lady says a UFO paced her car. In 1959, two pilots had a near-collision with a 
UFO. In 1964, a man saw a UFO with twelve humanoids inside it. In 2008, a father and son 
saw strange orbs hovering over the ocean. In 2023, a couple saw and filmed V-shaped 
craft over Daytona Beach.</p>

<p>STATESVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1955, a trained observer saw three discs cavorting 
playfully in the sky. In 1986, a father and son saw a massive metallic craft land in 
their corn field, and through the windows they could see many humanoid figures.</p>

<p>ANNADALE, NEW YORK. In 1975 two boys walking in the forest saw a glowing object 
hovering over some trees. Returning the next day, they found strange burn marks in 
the trees. In 2004, a young man saw a glowing sphere appearing and disappearing over 
his home.</p>

<p>Nine new locations: each with a history of UFO encounters. These encounters are 
supported by multiple witnesses, landing traces, physiological effects, animal 
reactions, photographs and more. The huge number of cases make it undeniable that 
we are being visited.</p>

DO NOT BE AFRAID: EIGHT EXTRAORDINARY ONBOARD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS</a>.</h3>
<h5>LINK: https://youtu.be/dm4tX8Z0bow</h5>   <span class="seeDate">March 21, 2025</span>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>The most extensive UFO encounter is being taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft. 
This is the cutting edge of UFO research. These cases  hold the potential to answer the 
many questions surrounding ET contact: who are these visitors to our planet, where do 
they come from, and why are they here? This video presents eight amazing cases involving 
people who have been taken onboard a UFO and met aliens face-to-face.</p>

<p>THE EARTH WILL ROLL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MARION FRANCIS. At 12:30 pm on Feb 
10, 1969, Marion Francis and her friend Jim Wells drove from Jacksonville, FL to Daytona 
Beach. It should’ve taken one a half hours, but weirdly it took five. Marion suffered 
from a bad headache, weakness and depression. Later, she went under hypnosis and 
recalled being taken onboard a craft. She was examined by a gray ET. They showed her 
where they came from, and said that Earth would one day tilt on its axis, and that 
the ETs would be there to rescue those who are not afraid to go.</p>

<p>DAZED AND CONFUSED IN A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSE PEREIRA SACRAMENTO. On 
the night of May 20, 1969, Jose Pereira Sacramento heard a noise outside his home in 
Vila Operaria, Brazil. Going to investigate, he was shocked to see a UFO landing in 
his backyard. He was suddenly pulled inside it where he met short beings standing in 
weird cylinders, speaking an unknown language. He was frozen in place as the room 
filled with painfully bright light. Suddenly he found himself back in bed. His eyes 
were badly inflamed, and he suffered from lightheadedness for a full year.</p>

<p>TRANSFORMED BY THE ETS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSEPH SUSEDIK. On May 26, 
1974, while camping at Mitchell Caverns in California, Joseph and his family saw a 
UFO. That night, he was woken up by colored lights outside the trailer and found 
himself immobilized. Upon awakening, he had vague memories of being taken somewhere. 
Later under hypnosis, he recalled an onboard UFO encounter where ETs showed him the 
inside of the craft, images of Saturn and various nebulae. Following this, Joseph 
became a prolific inventor, and he and his wife pioneered the field of prenatal 
learning.</p>

<p>PROBED BY ALIENS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JANET STEWART. While driving to a 
friend’s house in Bethel, Minnesota on the night of Jan 6, 1976, Janet was shocked 
when a UFO paced her car. Picking up her friend, she also saw the UFO. Arriving home, 
Janet was missing an hour of time, and had sore eyes. Under hypnosis, she recalled she 
had been stopped by the UFO, and taken onboard. She was physically examined and 
returned to her car. The encounter made, her a more easy-going, open-minded and 
tolerant person.</p>

<p>THERE ARE THINGS I STILL CANNOT TELL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF NESTOR URRUTI. 
On the morning of May 14, 1976, Nestor Urruti was driving through Olivarria, 
Argentina when a UFO pulled him onboard with his truck. He found himself sitting in 
front of a horseshoe-shaped panel with odd symbols. A telepathic voice told him that 
one day the ETs will reveal themselves to the world. He then found himself back in 
his truck. He was badly traumatized and had to be hospitalized.</p>

<p>YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE THINGS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DOROTHY Y. On Sept 15, 
1976, Dorothy was awakened by bright lights outside her home in New London, MO. 
Going outside, she saw short strange beings. Suddenly, she was in bed and it was the 
next morning. Later under hypnosis, she was taken onboard and recalled being 
physically examined. The ETs told her that she would being to see things: a 
prediction which turned out to be true when she began having psychic visions of 
disasters.</p>

<p>A JOURNEY ONBOARD A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF VICTOR AND BORIS. In Jul 
1986, while hiking in the woods outside of Shenkursk, Russia, Victor and Boris, 
came upon a strange craft and two human-looking men in jumpsuits. The men invited 
Victor and Boris onboard. So began an amazing journey where the two witnesses were 
flown across Europe. They asked many questions of the strange men. At one point, 
one of the ETs allowed Victor to pilot the craft. They were then returned back to 
the forest, amazed by their encounter.</p>

<p>A FIGHT WITH STRANGE HUMANOIDS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROLF FULLER. On 
July 25, 1992, Rolf was amazed to see a UFO outside his family’s home in Tuttlingen, 
Germany. That night, he woke up to find himself inside a UFO, confronted by short 
ETs with large eyes. Rolf fought with the ETs. Suddenly, he was knocked unconscious. 
He woke up back in bed and to his shock, the humanoids were still there!</p>

<p>Eight onboard cases, each with details which are remarkably similar and confirm 
each other’s accounts, and each with unique details that show how much we still 
have to learn. What these cases do show is that people all over the world are being 
taken onboard extraterrestrial craft and meeting extraterrestrials face-to-face. 
It has been happening for a long time.</p>

MY MOTHER THE MANTIS: THE TRUE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTACT STORY OF SONDRA X</a>.</h3>
<h5>LINK: https://youtu.be/6hEgoSfheuo</h5>   <span class="seeDate">March 14, 2025</span>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>A teacher from Virginia, Sondra came from a military family and has lived in many 
locations on the planet. She was born in 1940, and like many ET contactees, unusual 
events surrounded her from a very young age. In fact, when she was only a few weeks 
old, her mother woke up one morning to see Sondra levitating above her crib! Soon 
other mystical events occurred. At age three, while living in sunny Long Beach in 
southern California, Sondra discovered that she was able to call forth the wind, 
and even make it snow.</p>

<p>In 1946, Sondra’s father (now an  attaché to a Navy Admiral) moved the family to 
Tsingtao, China where they lived in the former Swiss Embassy building. There Sondra 
soon displayed other abilities. She began having out-of-body experiences. Fresh-cut 
flowers would remain alive and healthy in her room for weeks on end. She began to 
hear a voice in her head teaching her about the human body. She excelled academically 
to a degree that should would soon skip grades in school, and more. Her stay in China 
was cut short by conflict within the country, and in 1947, her father was called to 
serve in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was there that Sondra had perhaps the most 
unusual event of her life.</p>
<p>Sondra had just turned eight-year-old and one day, with her parents’ permission, she 
decided to ride her bicycle to a friend’s home one mile away. This was something she had 
done many times, but on this occasion, she never made it there. When she did not arrive, 
her family began a 7-hours-long frantic search for Sondra, finally finding her dazed and 
in a trance alongside the remote highway near her home, in an area where they had already 
searched several times. They asked her what happened, but Sondra did not dare tell them. 
She knew they would never believe her.</p>
<p>As she biked down the desolate highway, a shadow appeared overhead, and looking up, 
she saw a metallic craft hover overhead. It quickly landed on the road in front of her. 
Sondra stopped and watched as an opening appearing in the craft, and standing in the 
doorway was a tall humanoid praying mantis beckoning her inside the craft. More 
curious than afraid, Sondra approached. That mantis being told Sondra to have no 
fear, that she was her mother and invited her onboard the craft. Fascinated, Sondra 
accepted the offer.</p>
<p>Entering the craft, she was shocked to see that it was much larger on the inside 
than the outside. Immediately a half-dozen short little figures crowded around her, 
playfully touching her blond hair and escorting her around the craft. She first 
thought they were little children, but saw that they had large bald heads, big 
dark eyes, and gray skin. Sondra explored the craft which was very sparse. Looking 
out a porthole, she was shocked to see the Earth off in the distance. The mantis 
being led her to the center of the room where there was a holographic device 
displaying full-color, three-dimensional images. Sondra was shocked and saddened 
to see images of soldiers, tanks, explosions and more.  The mantis said, “What 
you are seeing are pictures of future wars,” and told Sondra that it was her 
duty to warn others about this.</p>
<p>After a few more messages, Sondra suddenly found herself back in her home with her 
concerned parents. Sondra later told her grandmother who shared that she also had 
encounters as a little girl, but otherwise learned to keep her experience a secret.</p>
<p>Sondra grew up, got a few college degrees, fell in love, got married and had 
children. She continued to have OBEs and other unusual events. Then one day her 
husband said he had seen grays at the foot of the bed speaking to Sondra. She had 
no memory of this, but shortly later, she began having repeated visitations by the 
grays in her bedroom, who would hold long conversations with her. The visits 
occurred for many years. Only a few times did Sondra ever see them arrive or 
leave. She rarely remembered the content of the conversations.</p>
<p>Eventually the visits slowed and one day stopped. One of her final visits occurred in 
2018. The grays had come to again give her in urgent warning about future wars on our 
planet, and advise her to move out of the city and into the mountains, a warning which 
she and her husband heeded. Today, she lives there peacefully. Sondra agreed to share her 
story as she feels its important to communicate the warnings given to her by the ETs. If 
you are interested in hearing more about Sondra’s amazing encounter, her story (and many 
others) is presented in my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO 
Encounters.” Now available!</p>

UNEARTHLY: TWELVE VERY WEIRD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS</a>.</h3>
<h5>LINK: https://youtu.be/GjgecsdVhwk</h5>   <span class="seeDate">March 7, 2025</span>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>There is nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature. An 
experience like this almost always has a profound effect on the witness, challenging them 
mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It is something they remember for the rest of 
their lives. Encounters like these are far more common than you might think, and involve 
a mind-boggling variation of humanoid types. Here are ten little-known cases coming from 
across the planet, each involving different humanoid creatures, from tiny beings less 
than a foot tall, to creatures upwards of twelve feet in height. Several involve multiple 
witnesses, not to mention landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions 
and medical effects.</p>

<p>A SIX-INCH HUMANOID. On April 20, 1945, an anonymous priest was picking edible 
mushrooms in the forest near Reneve, France when he saw a 6-inch-tall little man 
wearing a full-body jumpsuit and carrying a little rod strapped to his back. The 
stunned priest wanted to capture the little man, but it quickly ran off into the 
bushes.</p>

<p>I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. One day in Spring of 1957, two 9-year-old boys 
were playing in a field near their homes in Taboada, Spain when movement caught their 
eye. Looking up, they saw a row of helmeted humanoids walking through the wall of 
house and up into the air where they promptly disappeared.</p>

<p>AN ALIEN AT THE FRONT DOOR. On the night of August 31, 1968, a lady heard a loud 
knock on the front door of her home in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. Opening the curtain, 
she saw a strange man, nearly 7 feet tall with a bald head, no ears, and glowing eyes, 
wearing a shiny black jumpsuit. She was paralyzed in fear as the man moved off, 
laughing.</p>

<p>ETS INVESTIGATE FARMHOUSE. On February 6, 1969, Jose Antonio Fioco was working at a 
farm in Pirassununga, Brazil when a UFO landed on the property. Three humanoids appeared, 
one sending down a beam of light on the chicken coop. This was just the first of many 
encounters in the area, including another landing witnessed by a crowd of people.</p>

<p>TWO HUMAN-LIKE FIGURES. One night in January 1974, a father and son were woken up 
when their home in Pjedsted, Denmark filled with light. Looking outside, they saw a 
saucer-shaped craft and two humanoids looking straight down at them. So began a 5-
minute-long staring contest which ended only as the craft moved away.</p>

<p>THE ALIEN IN THE FOREST. Going into woods to train his dog around midnight on 
January 4, 1977, an auto-worker from Carapito, Portugal came upon a large saucer-
shaped craft with a humanoid standing below it. After a few moments, the craft 
and humanoid disappeared, but researchers later found landing traces at the site.</p>

<p>THE GIANT GLOWING FIGURE. At 10pm on night in November 1977, John and Gail 
Weldon drove along a rural road in the Megalong Valley in NSW, Australia when a 
gigantic glowing figure upwards of 12-feet in height strode towards their car. 
This is just one of several dramatic UFO incidents in this area.</p>

<p>WHAT BEAUTIFUL EYES. One night in May 1991, KT, a lady living in an apartment in the 
small town of Istok, Russia kept hearing strange footsteps. Finally she was confronted 
by a gray-type ET with huge dark beautiful eyes. Later, investigators learned that other 
people in the building reported strange events, including seeing a UFO that very night.</p>

<p>TWO VERY STRANGE HUMANOIDS. One night in Winter 1994, two young men were riding a 
motorbike on a rural road outside Musei, Italy when they came upon a 1-foot-tall 
humanoid with large eyes and pointing ears crossing the road in front of them. Years 
earlier, the witness and his family had an even more frightening encounter with a 
winged humanoid.</p>

<p>EYES LIKE A FLY. Hearing a strange beeping noise late on the night of May 10, 1995, 
a teenage boy exited the bedroom of his home in Columbia, Missouri and was terrified 
to see a 4-foot-tall gray alien staring at him through the living room glass door only 
three feet away.</p>

<p>THE ET IN THE RAIN. One night in October 1995, two 13-year-old girls were horseback 
riding through the woods near their homes in Breitbrunn, Germany. Without warning, 
they came upon a dome-shaped silver saucer covered with colored lights sitting on the 
ground, and next to it were little “munchkin-sized” humanoids.</p>

<p>CHARGED BY AN ALIEN. Around 7:30 pm one evening in July 2018, “Jacob” was playing 
in the yard of his grandparents' home in a rural and isolated area of Newaygo, Michigan. 
Movement behind a tree caught his eye. To his shock, a tall, skinny creature with a big 
bald head, large eyes and gray skin crawled out, stood up and stared, then suddenly 
charged right at him.</p>

<p>These twelve cases offer a brief glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face 
unearthly encounter with strange humanoids. These cases show how scary and traumatic an 
encounter can be, and make it clear that we still have a lot to learn about who is 
walking among us on this planet.</p>

UFOS IN ANTARCTICA: TWELVE TRUE CASES</a>.</h3>
<h5>LINK: https://youtu.be/tBxl3dv38-s</h5>   <span class="seeDate">February 28, 2025</span>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>It’s the coldest, windiest, driest, highest and most remote place on Earth. Its 
average temperature is 50-70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. It has no permanent 
residents. It contains up to 90 percent of the world’s freshwater. It covers 5.5 
million square miles, about 98 percent of which is covered with ice. This is, of 
course, Antarctica. Nobody owns it. The 1951 Antarctic treaty outlawed ownership, 
and limits its use to peaceful, scientific research. Each year, 1000-5000 scientists 
and military officers are stationed at the various bases. About 40,000 tourists visit 
there yearly. As with the Arctic, conspiracies abound, from secret Nazi bases, to an 
entrance to the hollow Earth. True or not, what is undeniably true is that the 
Antarctic has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. This video presents twelve 
cases of UFOs in Antarctica. They reach back 75 years and include sightings, landings, 
and humanoids. A few represent some of the best-verified UFO encounters in the history 
of ufology.</p>

<p>WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS TO PROVE WHAT WE SAW. While at the Chilean base, Arturo Prat, 
on February 23, 1948 Captain Augusto Vars Orrego of the Chilean Navy says that “During 
the bright Antarctic night, we saw flying saucers, one above the other, turning at 
tremendous speeds. We have photographs to prove what we saw.” Sadly, the photos were 
never released.</p>

<p>THE COLD SCRUTINY OF UNKNOWN EYES. On January 8, 1956. Four Chilean scientists stationed at Robertson Island in the Weddell Sea saw two metallic cigar-shaped objects hovering in a vertical position overhead. Thus began an hours-long encounter during which their Geiger counter went off. They took many photographs, but again, the photos have never been released.</p>

<p>I’M ASHAMED TO SAY I PANICKED. On December 11, 1958, McMurdo Sound Base, AQI Roger Benson was driving a snow-tractor outside the base when he came upon a landed UFO and a strange humanoid. He drove away in fear. At that time, a wave of sightings swept the area, many of which were caught on radar. Rear Admiral Dufek, then in charge of the base said, “I believe in UFOs.”</p>

<p>A POLISHED GOLD SURFACE. On June 7, 1962, Navy scientists at Hallett Station saw a brilliant golden disc in the sky. They were able to use binoculars to discern the disc-shape of a solid object. Despite this, Project Blue Book labeled the case as the sighting of Jupiter.</p>

<p>UFO INVESTIGATES NUCLEAR TEST. On July 9, 1962, the US detonated a 1.45 megaton in space 250 miles over Johnson Atoll, blowing out Earth’s magnetic field for 30 seconds, knocking out several satellites, and damaging the electric grid. Following the explosion, an expedition in Antarctica viewed a massive UFO heading to the area of the explosion.</p>

<p>UFOs TAKE CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT. On April 20, 1964, a C-130 flight near McMurdo Station lost power. Nine UFOs showed up and held the plane aloft for many miles. The crew took 9 rolls of film. The strangest part of the encounter happened when the plane landed and the crew unloaded the equipment, which weighed far less than it should.</p>

<p>UFO WAVE OVER DECEPTION ISLAND. In June and July of 1965, a wave of UFO sightings swept over the military and scientific bases stationed on Deception Island. With hundreds of observations by trained observers, recorded with a variety of scientific instrumentation, including photos, the wave represents undeniable evidence of UFO reality.</p>

<p>THE BUZZING CLOUD. On May 22, 1966, a British survey team at Mount Gaudry observed a strange cloud-like object sending a beam down to the ground, and moving in ways that ruled out conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon.</p>

<p>UFO OVER VOLCANIC ERUPTION. On December 4, 1967, a volcanic eruption at Mount Deception forced an emergency evacuation and destroyed both the British and Chilean stations located there. Incredibly, a photo captured not only the disaster, but what appears to be a UFO.</p>

<p>ANTARCTICA UFO CRASH. Reports of UFO crashes abound and there is at least one in Antarctica. Although not well-verified, reportedly in October 1982 when an expedition searching for meteorites allegedly came upon a crashed craft and five ET bodies.</p>

<p>THEY’RE DOING THE STRANGEST THING. Per Linda Moulton Howe, in 1983 (date approx.) “Brian,” claims that while based at McMurdo he was on a flight over the Transantarctic Mountains when they encountered a group of UFOs on maneuvers, one of several strange events he experienced.</p>

<p>AN ENORMOUS CIRCLE OF LIGHT. In April 1991, scientists at the Argentinian General San Martin Base received anomalous readings on their scientific instrumentation indicating the presence of a large power source overhead. Hours later, one of the men made a visual observation of a massive object.</p>

<p>With so many encounters, observed by so many trained scientists, verified by such a wide variety of scientific instruments and photographed, there is only one possible conclusion: the Antarctic is being visited by UFOs.</p>

<p>The Arctic has always been a place of mystery and wonder. The magical Northern Lights, 
a rich wildlife of polar bears, seals, foxes and more, surviving in one of the most 
inhospitable locations on our planet, continue to capture our imagination. Speculation 
and conspiracies about the Arctic abound. But what is the truth? Have UFOs been seen 
there? The answer of course is yes! The Arctic Circle is 9,900 miles in circumference. 
Only 8 countries are located within this area, and yet it encompasses about 7.7 million 
miles. It also has a rich, varied history of UFO encounters reaching back to 1850 
continuing up to the current day. This video presents 25 of the best-verified and most 
fascinating accounts from the Arctic Circle.  These cases involve sightings, landings, 
humanoids and even an apparent UFO crash!</p>

<p>TWO UNKNOWN OBJECTS. In 1850, the crew of a ship sailing the Wellington Channel 
observed a mysterious glowing object.</p>

<p>AN EERIE EVENT. In 1912, the Russian Ship, Saint Anna became icebound in the Arctic 
for two years. On November 8, 1913, they had a remarkable sighting of a red glowing 
object.</p>

<p>ESKIMO VILLAGE DISAPPEARS. In 1930, trapper Joe Labelle went to Lake Angikuni, Canada 
to trade with the local village, only to find that everyone was gone. But where did they 
go?</p>

<p>THE WATCHING GLOBES. During WWII, four ships in a convoy in the Norwegian Sea had an 
extensive encounter with weird glowing objects.</p>

<p>PROJECT PTARMIGAN. Researcher Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens reveals that during his work 
in Alaska with Project Ptarmigan, many officers had incredible encounters with UFOs.</p>

<p>“IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE ENTIRE POPULATION.” In August 1950, resident of an arctic 
village and Russian aviators observe glowing discs in the sky for three days in a row.</p>

<p>THE SPITSBERGEN ISLAND UFO CRASH. In May 1952, a disc with UFO occupants allegedly 
crashed on the remote Spitsbergen Island.</p>

<p>UFO TRACKED ON THEODOLITE. On June 26, 1952, weather observers on Padloping Island 
track a UFO for five minutes.</p>

<p>“YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.” On April 29, 1952, navy pilots at Thule, Greenland 
observe three UFOs investigating a skyhook weather balloon.</p>

<p>A STRANGE OBJECT. In February 1953, the crew and passengers of a WV-2 Super 
Constellation observe a UFO over Thule, Greenland.</p>

<p>THIRD THULE SIGHTING. On December 9, 1953, three Navy flights over Thule, Greenland 
observe a strange craft near their jets.</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED. On August 29, 1954, the crew and passengers of a Dutch Airlines DC-4 see 
a fleet of dark objects near Prince Christian, Greenland.</p>

<p>SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL. In 1956, two Russian pilots of a TU-4 aircraft have an 
extensive sighting of a pearly disc-shaped object pacing their plane.</p>

<p>EXTREME ALTITUDE ARCTIC OBJECT. In November 1958, a US radar station detects an 
object hovering above the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>A DISC LANDS AT UMIAT. In 1958-1959 a wave of sightings in the Arctic Circle caused 
concern within Finland and the Soviet Union. One case involved a landing at Umiat, 
Alaska.</p>

<p>NOTHING ON EARTH. On March 16, 1961, the crew of the USS Glacier observed “strange 
luminous aerial phenomenon.”</p>

<p>A PEARL-COLORED DISC. In February 1967, pilots over Tiksi, Siberia saw a pearl-
colored disc-shaped craft overtake their plane.</p>

<p>DISCONCERTINGLY CAPTIVATING, DEEPLY PROVOCATIVE, UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. On August 
22, 1967, Soviet journalist Alfred Tulchensky had a closeup sighting of a metallic disc 
over the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia.</p>

<p>AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED TO ME ON MY WAY TO THE NORTH POLE. On March 1, 1968, 
while flying over the Arctic Circle, reporter Sally Remaley and others saw a group of 
six craft landed on the frozen tundra.</p>

<p>ESKIMOS OBSERVE UFO LANDING. On August 16-17, 1972 a wave of sightings occurred over 
St. Michael, Alaska, including a UFO landing.</p>

a close-up encounter with a glowing disc.</p>

<p>AN EERIE APPEARANCE. On October 22, 1980, a Soviet Air Force Pilot saw a huge metallic 
disc-shaped craft which disabled his aircraft.</p>

<p>CAUGHT ON RADAR. On January 5, 1981, observers at Thule Air Base in Greenland observed 
a UFO which is also caught on radar.</p>

<p>ARCTIC HUMANOID. In 1982 (approx.,) two men at an airbase in Greenland saw a humanoid. 
One was taken onboard a craft and given a vital message for all humanity.</p>

<p>WE ALL GOT REAL QUIET. On February 22, 1997, four people in Aklavic, Canada are paced 
in their car by two metallic craft.</p>

<p>WE’RE USED TO IT. For two weeks in December 2002, UFOs appeared so regularly over 
Noorvik, Alaska that residents saw them nightly.</p>

<p>These 25 cases are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to UFOs seen within the 
Arctic Circle. Cases likely number in the thousands. Because the Arctic is so remote and 
uninhabited, most activity likely goes unobserved by human eyes.</p>

<p>There are now enough cases to prove that UFOs and ETs are visiting the Arctic.</p>

<p>Healing is a major part of the extraterrestrial agenda. There are more than 300 cases 
coming from major researchers across the world including Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John 
Mack, Barbara Lamb, Edith Fiore, Timothy Good, Brad Steiger and more. People are being 
cured of a wide variety of injuries, illnesses, and conditions. Accounts reach back more 
than 100 years up to the present day. They can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Most 
cases occur onboard UFOs or in a person’s home, but a small portion of cases occur in a 
place you would never expect: inside a hospital. It may sound incredible, but almost ten 
percent of UFO healing cases fit this category. This video presents 17 cases of this kind, 
which are only a small portion of the actual number of cases.</p>

<p>MY SIGHT RESTORED. April 1945, Okinawa Island. After being struck by shrapnel in his 
eye and suffering an eye infection that rendered him blind, Howard Menger is visited in 
his hospital tent and healed.</p>

<p>EYES FILLED WITH GREAT COMPASSION. June 1946, Camp Lee, VA. Allan Edwards is visited 
by a beautiful and unusual-looking man who he believes healed a patient of severe assault 
injuries.</p>

<p>YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO LOSE THAT FINGER. 1960s, NJ. After losing his hearing in a sled 
accident, Richard Rylka is healed in his hospital room by human-looking ETs. Later, 
after crushing his finger in an industrial accident, the ETs visit him again in the 
hospital.</p>

<p>WE’VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. May 1962, Durham, England. After being diagnosed 
with a hole in his lung, Fred White is visited by a human-looking ET who heals him with 
a strange instrument.</p>

<p>THE MIRACLE PATIENT. 1967, Lima, Peru. In 1967, Ludwig Pallman is visited in his room 
in the Maison Hospital by a human-looking female ET who cures him of kidney problems.</p>

<p>“THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.” 1971, Laguna, CA. Burned on his neck and chest, Dr. Fred Bell 
is healed in his hospital room with the help of an artifact given to him by human-
looking ETs.</p>

<p>MY DOCTOR WAS AMAZED. November 1981, Hubbard, OR. After an emergency C-section, Denise 
Twiggs is visited by an ET who speeds up the healing of her caesarean scar.</p>

<p>A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM. Summer 1982, Willamette, Oregon. Suffering from a strep 
infection which has spread through his body, “Douglas” is healed by an ET using a 
strange silver instrument.</p>

<p>TOTALLY RECUPERATED. Summer 1989, Kiev, Ukraine. Lying in his hospital room after a 
stroke, Sergey K is visited by a human-looking figure who heals him by waving his hand 
over his body.</p>

<p>GET UP AND GO! April 18, 1989, Krasnoperekopsk, Ukraine. At the end stages of heart 
disease, Liudmila Petrovna is brought back to full health by a glowing man who appears 
in her hospital room.</p>

<p>I WAS SAVED. 1990s. Location unknown. When doctors were unable to heal her of 
pneumonia, Joni Ferris is abducted from her hospital room and cured by ETs.</p>

MIRACLE LEGS. November 1995, Sacramento, CA. After doctors told Connie Isele that they 
would have to amputate her leg, she is visited by ETs who cure her!</p>

<p>COMPLETELY HEALED. 2002. Italy. A man suffering from cancer is healed by three 
humanoid figures in glowing jumpsuits. The event is allegedly caught on video in his 
hospital room.</p>

<p>THEY CURED ME. 2005, Miami, FL. While being prepared for emergency surgery to remove 
a cancerous tumor in his lungs, Alberto Fernandez is suddenly healed by his ET friends.</p>

<p>THEY LOOKED LIKE PRAYING MANTIS. 2008, Canada. A woman visits her friend (suffering 
from a head injury) is amazed to see two praying mantis humanoids trying to heal her 
friend.</p>

<p>A SHINING GOLDEN LIGHT. February 2009, Andorra, Spain. Doctors report that at least 
four children are visited by ETs in their hospital rooms, curing them of terminal cancer.</p>

<p>TAUGHT BY THE ETS. Professor Bochereshoni, a mental health doctor from Tbilisi, 
Georgia, says he is visited by ETs in the hospital who assist him in diagnosing and 
curing patients suffering from mental illness.</p>

<p>Cases like these may sound incredible, but there are far too many to explain away 
as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. The miraculous recoveries 
verified by doctors and researchers speak for themselves. The UFO healing cases provide 
compelling evidence for extraterrestrial intervention. With 300 documented cases, it’s 
undeniable that ETs are on a healing mission across our planet. To explore these cases 
in more detail (and many others) check out my book, “The Healing Power of UFOs,” now 
available!</p>

<p>For many people, a humanoid encounter is one of the most shocking and incredible 
experiences of their lives. When someone experiences something that is completely 
foreign to their worldview, it can be incredibly difficult to understand and process. 
An encounter can be so shocking that it becomes almost impossible to speak about it. 
This video presents ten very close encounters with humanoids, several of which only 
became investigated through fortuitous circumstances. Many of these involve multiple 
witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence such as landing traces, animal 
reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE UFO NEXT DOOR</span>. On the night of May 5, 1952, Ann L Sohn 
(a nurse) looked out the window of her home in Prospect Park, Illinois and saw a massive, 
saucer-shaped craft. Through the portholes, Ann saw humanoids looking down at her. After 
a few moments, the craft darted away. Later, Ann learned that other people in the area 
saw UFOs on that same night. And the plants where the craft had hovered died.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED</span>. On the night of December 9, 
1960, Madame Dhelens looked out the window of her home in Carignan, France and saw an 
oval-shaped craft landed in the yard. Inside, she saw movement through a few portholes. 
It quickly rose up and darted away. Unknown to her, several people in the area also 
saw it. The next day, a circle of yellowed grass was found where the craft had landed.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE</span>. On the 
night of March 20, 1967, Jim Rible and his daughter Jean decided to take a drive to 
investigate weird lights in the sky that Jim’s wife had seen near their home in Butler, 
Pennsylvania. They saw the lights, but then the lights zoomed at them. Jean heard voices 
speaking to her mentally. Then five beings appeared in front of their car. It scared 
them so bad, they fled the scene.</p>
 
<p><span class="bigBoy">THE MAN ON THE FLYING BOX</span>. At 5:30 pm one night in 
November 1974, Giovanna Sensoli was at her farm in Case di Mordano, Italy when her 
animals acted crazily. Looking up, she saw a man in a jumpsuit straddling a floating 
box-shaped craft and looking down at her. A short distance away a brilliant object 
hung in the sky. Giovanna watched in amazement as it moved off and seemed to land 
in a nearby cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">A ROBOTIC BEING</span>. At 1:30 am in mid-September 1977, Luis 
Almeida was watering the garden behind his home in Gondomar, Portugal when a bright 
light shone on him from behind the brick wall bordering his property. Looking up, he 
was shocked to see that the light was coming from a gray, metallic, robot-looking 
figure at least 6 feet tall. Terrified, he ran inside, and was so traumatized, he 
couldn’t talk about it.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE DAY THE ETS CAME TO VISIT</span>. It was the night of 
November 2, 1977 as 16-year-old LC watched TV in his aunt’s house in Joaquin Murtinho, 
Brazil. Suddenly a metallic orb entered his home. A tall man dressed in a jumpsuit and 
two other figures appeared. Going outside, he saw a craft in the backyard. The ETs 
spoke to him telepathically, gave him predictions, then entered their craft and departed.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE ALIEN AND THE FISHERMEN</span>. On the night of February 4, 
1978, six men fishing on Lake La Florida in San Luis, Argentina got the shock of their 
life when a saucer appeared overhead and released a tall, fair-haired, human-looking 
man dressed in a silver suit and transparent helmet. The man walked up to them, smiled, 
made a gesture of friendship, and left. The being left footprints in the ground, and 
others saw the UFO.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">THE SINGING EXTRATERRESTRIALS</span>. On February 1982, two men 
were in the area of Borok, Russia to take photos of monuments when they came upon a 
landed craft. Two humanoids in jumpsuits emerged. One of the men became entranced and 
immobilized, but the other remained awake as the beings approached and communicated to 
him with harmonic tones. They left after a few minutes, but the witness’s life was 
changed forever.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">IT WAS STRANGE</span>. One night in August of 1983, four 
12-year-old boys were playing in the woods outside their homes in Opole, Poland. 
Suddenly a thick fog appeared. Moments later, a craft landed right in front of 
them. They saw two humanoids exit and run by them into the forest. They gave 
chase but the ETs eluded them. The craft took off leaving behind undeniable landing 
traces.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">“HUMANS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE.”</span> On March 26, 2002, 
an anonymous salesman was driving outside Cazalla de la Sierra, Spain when a pear-shaped 
craft blocked the road ahead. Looking into the field, he saw two very tall humanoids in 
jumpsuits. He exited his car and spoke with one of the beings who was very friendly and 
told him that Earth was a very beautiful place.</p>

<p>These ten cases are just a small portion of the actual number of cases, and yet they 
each provide amazing insights about ET contact. There are now enough documented cases 
to conclude that we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>UFOs are being seen all over this planet. To prove this fact, I put out a challenge: 
name any town or city, and I will find an encounter there. And I have! I have explored 
almost 100 towns and cities and every one of them has a history of UFO encounters. Not 
just sightings, but landings, face-to-face meetings with humanoids, onboard encounters 
and even UFO crashes. In this latest episode, we explore eight new places including, 
Albion, MI; Austin, TX; Leesville, LA; Whittier, CA; Huntsville, AL; Elkton, MD; Seoul, 
South Korea and finally, Oshkosh, WI. These cases reach back decades and have lots of 
evidence: photos, radar-returns, landing traces, animal reactions, medical effects, 
and even metal fragments. We are not alone!</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">ALBION, MICHIGAN</span>. In 1967, Charles W. Smith encountered 
a UFO which told him telepathically to talk to his priest. Two sightings later, Charles 
told his priest who turned out to have a close UFO connection himself. Later, Charles 
encountered a landed UFO with humanoids. In 1973, numerous police in Albion reported 
UFOs. In 1980, the Shive family described their harrowing encounter with a UFO that 
stalled their van on a lonely road at night. Even as late as 2007 UFOs continued to 
visit Albion.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">AUSTIN, TEXAS</span>. This large city has a rich UFO history. In 1950, three men saw a craft hover over downtown. In 1971, a craft landed in a lady’s front-yard and out stepped three humanoids. In 1974, Ray Stanford and his team captured an amazing long-exposure photo. In 1977, Ray had his own daylight sighting. In 1988, three men came upon a landed disc and humanoids; they all had missing time. More incredible encounters occurred throughout the 2000s, including UFOs captured on videotape.

<p><span class="bigBoy">LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA</span>. On April 12, 1960, a UFO was seen and heard by dozens of people as it moved overhead and exploded into the ground before flying off. It left behind landing traces and metal fragments. Project Blue Book wrote an 80-page report on the case which remains unsolved. In 1975, a mother and her son had a very close-up encounter with a disc-shaped craft. In 1996, UFOs over the town generated numerous calls to radio stations and newspapers reporting strange lights over the town.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA</span>. In 1957, people across Whittier saw up to six saucer-shaped craft hovering and maneuvering overhead. In 1966, a car was chased for many miles by a craft. In 1967, two men had a close-up sighting of a metallic craft with portholes hovering over their front yard. On the night of March 23, 1977 when dozens of police and military officers sighted UFOs over a wide area for nine hours! In 1978, a lady saw a craft over the freeway.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA</span>. In 1950, two men saw a metallic craft over the city. Two sightings occurred in 1952, both with many witnesses. In 1975, a man followed a UFO in his car into the woods and had two hours of missing time. In 1981, a woman had had an onboard experience involving a strange humanoid. That same year, another man reported his encounter with a giant craft. In 1988, a craft rose out of Gunterville Lake. It followed them home. In 2023, a witness captured photo of UFOs over the city.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">ELKTON, MARYLAND</span>. In 1971, a family and other witnesses encountered two UFOs while driving into Elkton. In 1988, a family driving into Elkton were followed by a UFO and had three hours of missing time. In 1993, two boaters on the Elk River had a bizarre encounter with a USO. That same year, a man had a scary encounter that resulted in hours of missing time. In 1994, a witness had a scary encounter with a saucer hovering over a field. And in 2012, an Elkton man reported a missing time encounter.</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA</span>. So many cases! In 1970, seven military officers and many residents saw a silver disc move overhead. In 1951, fighter pilots observed green spheres which were also caught on radar. Sightings occurred throughout the 1950s, some of which were also caught on radar. In 1979, a soldier stationed at Kunsan Airbase says a humanoid entered his barracks. In 1981 and 1982 there were two sightings of a cone-shaped UFO.  From 1995-2012, three cases occurred, all involving photos!</p>

<p><span class="bigBoy">OSHKOSH, WISCONSIN</span>. Way back in 1886, at midday, a darkness settled over Oshkosh causing a city-wide panic. In 1947, three witnesses came upon a hovering craft with humanoids looking out the window. In 1956, a group of children had two sightings of UFOs on one day. In 1979, many people called the police reporting a red UFO which apparently crashed into the ground. In 2012, people over a wide area reported strange lights in the sky. In 2022, a UFO was captured on photograph over the suburbs.</p>

<p>So many cases involving close encounters of the first, second and third kind. Too many cases to deny or explain away. The only alternative is that these cases are true; we are being visited by extraterrestrials. It doesn’t matter where you live on Earth, UFOs have been there!</p>

<p>People across the world are reporting direct contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. 
Cases reach back more than 100 years and number in the many thousands, or as some 
researcher believe, in the millions. Researchers have discovered that contact is often 
generational, following certain family lines. As a general rule, it begins in early 
childhood and continues throughout a person’s life. This video presents the contact 
experiences of Mike W, a retired apartment manager originally from Norman, Oklahoma. 
His encounters include events that are both typical and commonly reported, as well as 
unique elements of extreme high strangeness.</p>

<p>Born in 1945, Mike’s experiences began in the early 1950s. Around age five, Mike 
would periodically and inexplicably disappear from his home. His parents and family 
would search for him, and find him sometimes miles from their home on a random street 
corner. Mike has no memories of these missing time encounters, but his parents assured 
him that it happened many times. Around that time, his parents extracted what appeared 
to be a strange, tiny, ceramic rod from his arm. In hindsight, Mike wonders, could this 
have been an alien implant?</p>

<p>Years passed with no unusual experiences. Mike moved to Portland, Oregon. And on May 
11, 1970, Mike (now 25 years old) had a series of three consecutive encounters on that 
day that would leave him baffled for the rest of his life. The first occurred while 
walking down the sidewalk in downtown Portland, near the local University where a 
series of anti-war protests had escalated to riots that would garner national headlines. 
Mike noticed two seven-foot-tall, identical-looking gentleman wearing dark suits walking 
towards him. They confronted him and told him, “We can take you anytime we feel like it.” 
A short conversation followed, and the men identified themselves as CIA agents. Mike 
didn’t believe them, but shocked and afraid, he turned and ran.</p>

<p>Later that night, he was walking down Jefferson Street when he saw a crowd of people 
watching a fight in front of a bar. Mike’s attention was drawn to two tall, identical-
looking gentlemen standing behind the crowd observing intently. The two men were seven 
feet tall, dressed identically in ankle-length brown robes and golden Nefertiti-like 
headwear. Also odd was that nobody seemed to notice them. Even stranger, they held 
their hands out in a peculiar way. Curious about their weird appearance and behavior, 
Mike stood next to them and asked them what they were doing. One of them replied that 
they were reading people’s minds to determine what was going on. Mike offered to 
investigate for them and almost ended up getting involved in the bar fight. When he 
turned around, the men were gone. Only then did he wonder, were they the same men who 
had confronted him earlier?</p>

<p>Walking back home, he had his third and strangest encounter. An attractive woman 
dressed in the same kind of ankle-length brown robe approached him and said, “I need to 
have sex with you.” It was an offer Mike couldn’t resist, and he took the woman home. 
Making love, he was shocked to find that the woman’s anatomy had some profoundly strange 
abnormalities. Her skin seemed rubbery. She began to communicate to him telepathically. 
And at one point, he looked at her and was shocked to see that she appeared to be bald. 
After being intimate, she left without a word and was gone. After thinking about it and 
the other two encounters, he began to wonder if all three encounters were connected, and 
were the people he had seen even human?</p>

<p>Years later, one night in 1988, Mike (now living in northern California) went up to 
the mountains overlooking the San Francisco Bay to play with his ham radio. Shortly after 
parking, he realized a brilliant light was shining down on him. Exiting his car, he 
turned and saw a gigantic craft hovering right above a hill a short distance away. It was 
not normal, and Mike stood there in awe. The next thing he knew, he had a lapse of 
consciousness and the craft was in a different place. It then disappeared in a flash. 
Mike forgot about the entire incident until he had a series of terrifying dreams of 
being taken inside a craft and examined by gray ETs. Recalling his sighting and missing 
time, he realized he had been abducted by aliens.</p>

<p>Following this encounter, weird things began to happen. He developed an interest and 
advanced knowledge of electronics. He exhibited psychic abilities that were so powerful, he 
vowed to never use them again. The encounter also changed his view of the world and his 
place in it. Eventually, he would have another UFO sighting that convinced him he was 
being watched by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Mike is just one of many people who are reporting UFO and extraterrestrial experiences. 
The complete story of his contacts is presented in my book, Humanoids and High Strangeness: 
Twenty True UFO Encounters , now available. LINK: https://amzn.to/3CaANiI.</p>

<p>For more than 100 years, people across the world have been taken onboard extraterrestrial 
craft. Many of the cases have commonalities that corroborate each other down to minute 
details. But they also have unique high strangeness aspects that have much to teach us. 
This video presents ten spectacular onboard UFO cases involving face-to-face interactions 
with a variety of ETs. Cases like these are the cutting edge of UFO research and have the

<p>Ten cases, each adding to the growing database of similar accounts. One case like this could be easily dismissed, or ten or even a hundred. But there are thousands of cases like these, and some researchers believe it might number in the millions. As hard as they are to believe, there are too many cases to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. Humanity is in contact with aliens!</p>

<p>The cutting edge of the UFO phenomenon are cases involving direct, firsthand, face-to-face contact with extraterrestrial humanoids. Unlike simple sightings, humanoid encounters allow us to closely interact with the UFO occupants themselves. Here are ten cases of extreme contact, cases of contact that are so close, so extensive, they cannot be denied or explained away. These are the kinds of cases that answer the many questions surrounding ET contact, such as who they are, where they come from and why they are here.</p>

<p>THE DISAPPOINTED ALIEN. On the night of October 18, 1954, Renzo Pugina returned home after a night at the movies. Walking up to his home in Parravicino, Italy, he was confronted by a four-foot-tall, olive-skinned entity wearing a jumpsuit and helmet. Afraid but curious, he approached the creature who struck him with a paralyzing beam of light. With great effort, Renzo broke free of the paralysis and chased the figure away.</p>
 
<p>THE MARTIAN STONE. Around midnight on November 17, 1954, Alberto Sanmartin Comes (a nurse) was taking a walk in Madrid, Spain, when he came upon a fair-skinned, angelic-looking man wearing a strange jumpsuit. The man walked up to a small craft landed nearby, quickly returned, and gaveAlberto a small stone covered with odd symbols. He then returned to his craft, which flew away. Alberto’s case generated national headlines as scientists analyzed the alien artifact.</p>

<p>THE ALIEN FROGMEN. One night in 1956, just after midnight, 13-year-old, Mr. E. Venebles woke up in his bedroom in Aveley, UK, as a brilliant light flooded his backyard. Looking out the window he saw a huge craft covered with colored lights. Through the portholes he saw several strange figures wearing “frogmen’s suits.” Then he saw a shadowy figure standing near his home. As he opened his window, the figure disappeared and the UFO flew off.</p>

<p>“I SAW A MAN.” On the morning of April 23, 1966, six-year-old Kim Baker was picking flowers outside her home in Bingham, Maine when a classic flying-saucer landed nearby. Kim was amazed to see a human-looking man smiling at her from one of the portholes. After a few moments, the craft took off. Kim rushed home and told her mother, who returned to the spot to find strange landing traces.</p>

<p>“A HUMAN-LIKE BEING WAS WATCHING ME.” On the night of March 25, 1972, Mr. B. of Soesterberg, the Netherlands was woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, he saw a strange light by his car. He rushed outside and felt compelled to drive off into the night. Shortly later, he came upon a landed UFO and inside it, a human-like figure looking at him.</p>

<p>ALIENS IN IOWA. On June 6, 1972, Mr. Teig was working the cornfields of his farm in Dayton, Iowa when a silver egg-shaped craft landed nearby. Out stepped three short alien figures wearing metallic jumpsuits. Mr. Teig froze in amazement as the ETs explored his crops for the next 30 minutes then returned to their craft and departed. At that time, many farmers were finding strange burned circles in their fields.</p>

<p>A SENSATION OF BEING WATCHED. One night in April 1973, a man was driving near Grelsby, Finland when he came upon a huge flying saucer. He exited his car to take a closer look. He smelled a powerful order, and watched the craft move towards him. He could now see strange figures in the portholes. The craft moved away. Later, the area would later having many dramatic encounters.</p>

<p>“THIS DEEP SILENCE SURROUNDED US.” On the night of August 22, 1975, two young men drove their motorcycles near St Omer, France. Suddenly a bright light zoomed up behind them. They thought it was a car, but it disappeared, and moments later, they saw a landed UFO and humanoids next to the highway. An eerie silence fell reigned as the two humanoids rushed towards them. The men fled in a panic.</p>

<p>SHOCKED BY A UFO. On the night of October 12, 1977, Manoel Espirito Santo and four friends were outside his home in Santo Antonio do Taua, Brazil when a glowing light appeared, zoomed down and revealed itself to be a craft. Two figures stood inside looking down on the group. A beam of light flashed down and struck Manoel, immobilizing him. It then darted off. At the time, many people in the area were having similar encounters.</p>

<p>“WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU.” In 1979, as a young child in Lima, Peru, Renato Longato woke up one evening to find a beautiful woman wearing a metallic jumpsuit approach his bedside and instruct him to learn how to “use his mind.” Renato decided to develop his psychic abilities, and years later, in 1985, had a face-to-face encounter with a handsome ET approached him with a special message just for him.</p>

<p>These ten firsthand cases of ET contact are just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of cases like these are on record, reaching back decades and coming from across the world. There are too many cases to deny, too much evidence. The truth is evident: we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Now introducing UFOs In Your Hometown: Episode Seven. This ongoing series began with a challenge: name any town or city, and I bet I can find a UFO case there. The response has been tremendous. More than 700 locations were received. And so far, I have found UFO cases in every town and city I have investigated. Sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences – all are represented. And supporting them is a wide variety of evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, photos and videos, landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Today we explore seven new locations, supplied by you, the viewers. These locations include Folsom, California; Napier, New Zealand; Bountiful, Utah; Hickory, North Carolina; Evansville, Indiana and Kalispell, Montana. Have UFOs been seen in your hometown? The answer is almost certainly, yes!</p>

<p>FOLSOM, CALIFORNIA. On August 17, 1960, witnesses observed a UFO hover over the city for two hours. Throughout 1972, numerous witnesses observed UFO activity over Folsom Lake. This location would regularly produce more encounters over the years, including all the way up to 2016. A very dramatic sighting of a rare “daylight disc” occurred along Highway 50 when two women were buzzed in their car by a low flying craft.</p>

<p>NAPIER, NEW ZEALAND. An early Napier sighting occurred in 1952 when a trucker observed a fleet of six objects traveling in a row across the sky. In 1953, a group of boy-scouts described their encounter with a very strangely-shaped UFO. In 1955, more than 20 people driving through Napier pulled off the road to observe a brilliant green UFO. Two years later in 1957, multiple independent witnesses saw a UFO on the same day. Activity continued in 1961, 1967 and in 1968, when a low flying UFO resulted in a witness being taken to court for reckless driving. A sighting of a landed UFO in 1969 caught the attention of researchers as it involved strange landing traces. Major sightings continued, making it clear that Napier is of great interest to UFOs.</p>

<p>BOUNTIFUL, UTAH. Although this city is fairly large, it has produced only a few significant UFO cases. One occurred in 1969 when two young men observed two UFOs while attending a late-night movie at a drive-in theater. A sighting on October 10, 2019 of multiple objects received considerable attention from researchers as the witness was able to obtain videotape of strange lights over the city.</p>

<p>HICKORY, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1952, two independent witnesses both observed a classic saucer move at high speed over the city. In 1959, a witness reported being chased by a glowing blue object in his car outside of Hickory, while numerous people in town and outside of it called police to report UFOs. In 1978, five young ladies reported a UFO circling over the local college. More cases of UFOs chasing cars down Hickory Highways occurred in 1980 and 1983.

<p>MCKINNEY, TEXAS. In 1956, more than a hundred people, including the mayor of the city, reported a UFO which hovered over McKinney for six hours. In 2008, an entire family was driving to a soccer match and all observed a strange cigar-shaped craft. In 2018, a couple reported the landing of a UFO in the field behind their home. It turned out that they had prior sightings and perhaps deeper levels of contact.</p>

<p>EVANSVILLE, INDIANA. In 1953, a young boy saw a spherical-shaped craft with humanoids looking down at him through portholes. Police were called who reportedly opened fire on the object. One night in 1955, a group of students observed strange green-skinned humanoids run across the playing field of a local high school. Major sightings occurred in 1957, 1959 and in 1963 when three people were in their car when it was disabled by a low-flying craft. Sightings continued in 1968, 1970, 1973 and in 1974 when a famous news-anchor reported his sighting of a craft, and four people say they were abducted by a UFO. More sightings occurred regularly, in 1975, 1976, 1978 and onward, including a 2008 sighting of a craft that was so close, the witnesses called it the scariest moment of their lives.</p>

<p>KALISPELL, MONTANA. In 1956, a UFO hovered over the nearby mountains for so long that the Air Force scrambled six Starfire fighter jets to investigate. Through the 1970s, numerous people reported a wide variety of sightings over Kalispell, some who were so impressed by their sightings, they reported them to UFO centers. Evan as late as 2019, UFOs were being seen over Kalispell.</p>

<p>The cases speak for themselves. UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen everywhere on this planet. Name any location, and you can be sure that UFOs have been seen there. UFO encounters are far more common than most people think. In fact, the huge number of cases coming from all over the world show that the ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity campaign to announce their presence. They want us to know that we are not alone!</p>

<p>There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids and more. But the most extensive of all UFO encounters is an onboard experience, being taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft. Thousands of people accross the world have reported this experience. Cases reach back more than 100 years. They involve a wide variety of humanoids and have both striking similarities and unique differences. Here are seven firsthand accounts of people who claim to have been taken onboard an ET craft.</p>

<p>“PEACE BE WITH YOU”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF JL BUICK. One day in July 1913, prospector J.L. Buick and a friend were explored the Badlands region of Montana when a “small brown man” approached and uttered the words, “Peace be with you, my friends.” Nearby sat a 100-foot-wide disc-shaped craft, surrounded by other small men. The man said that they had monitored Earth for more than a hundred years. After a short conversation, the ETs boarded the craft and departed. The craft returned the next day. J.L. Buick and his companion were invited onboard and given a tour of the craft. The ETs said they powered it with an “electromagnetic drive.” Afterwards, the men were returned to Earth.</p>

<p>“GOD IS ONLY ONE”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MARIO RESTIER. On December 4, 1949, Mario Restier was driving near Volta Redonda in Brazil when a 50-foot-wide craft landed nearby. A telepathic voice said, “Don’t be afraid. Do you want to know what it is?” Mario approached and met two humanoids who invited him onboard and, he says, took him to their planet in the Orion system and given a tour of their city. He held a long conversation with them and was returned to Earth. A second encounter occurred a few years later. Mario began to study physics and soon began plans to build a magnetic motor.</p>

<p>A STRANGE OCCURRENCE: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF COMMANDER HORATIO R. PENROSE. On May 13, 1954, Commander Horatio Penrose was driving near Derby, England when a brilliant light swooped over his car. The next thing he knew, he was waking up in a hospital recovering from head injuries. As time passed, he recalled that immediately after the accident he was pulled onboard a craft by human-looking ETs who were interested in his work with radar in the Navy. Later, Commander Penrose located a witness who had seen the UFO hovering over his car.</p>

<p>“THESE WERE NOT EARTH PEOPLE”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS OF MIMI GORZELLE. On the afternoon of May 30, 1965, Mimi Gorzelle lay on the roof of her cottage at Mason Lake, Wisconsin when a UFO appeared. To her shock, she saw two gray ETs looking at her from the portholes. The next thing she knew, the craft was leaving and four hours had passed. Afterwards, she meditated on the incident and recalled that she was taken onboard by the grays. A few months later, she was taken onboard again and saw human-looking figures who showed interest in her psychic abilities.</p>
 
<p>“I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHAT A UFO WAS.”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF CARLOS ALBERTO DIAZ. Around 3:50 am on January 5, 1975, Carlos Alberto Diaz was walking with two friends to his home in Puerto Ingeniero White, Argentina when a UFO appeared overhead. Carlos was was pulled onboard in full view of his two friends. Inside, he met three greenish humanoids wearing tan, rubbery suits who began to take hair samples. Carlos passed out and woke up hours later, and more than 400 miles away. Rushed to the hospital, he was examined by 47 officials who became convinced of his encounter.</p>

<p>TAKEN FROM THE BACK YARD: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF VLADIMIR KHARITONOV. On January 15, 1978, student Vladimir Kharitonov went to visit his parents in Pskov, Russia. Going outside, he was shocked to see three humanoid figures dressed in metallic suits in the backyard. Next to them was a small craft with a transparent dome. Vladimir accepted an invitation to enter the craft, and suddenly realized that the craft was flying upwards. Fearing he was being taken away, he became hostile and fought the ETs. He promptly passed out and woke up lying in his parents’ backyard.</p>

<p>PSYCHOANALYZED BY THE GRAYS: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF BRIAN X. On February 24, 2011, Brian (pseudonym) was in his home in Lee's Summit, Missouri when colored lights entered his bedroom, putting him into a trance. He felt a small hand grab his. The next thing he knew, he was lying on a table being examined by three gray ETs. To his amazement, he had the impression that the craft itself was a living being, and that it was psychically connected to the grays. He sensed that the grays were there to help him. After being examined, he was returned to his bedroom.</p>

<p>Seven encounters, each providing a tantalizing glimpse into the what it’s like to be taken onboard a UFO. Each case provides another piece of the puzzle and adds to our knowledge of ET contact. There are too many cases to explain away. UFOs are real; we are being visited.</p>

Many questions remain regarding the nature and origin of UFO entities, which is why continuing research and documentation is so important. In this video I present ten little-known cases from across the world, from the 1940s to the 2010s. Many different types of humanoids are represented, gray ETs, short little beings, human-looking ETs, very tall figures and more. Many involve multiple witnesses and various forms of evidence. These ten cases provide a tantalizing glimpse into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon: face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.

UFO LANDING DURING WWII. One summer day in 1942, thirteen-year-old Madeleine Arnoux was bicycling near Verger, France. Stopping to pick some berries, she was shocked to see a saucer-shaped craft and several dark-suited humanoids. Frozen in fear, she bent down to get her bike. There was a blast of wind and the craft was gone. But the memory remained for the rest of her life.

“THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM US.” On the night of October 25, 1954, two 12-year-old boys were minding sheep in the fields near Appignano, Italy when they came upon three tiny beings wearing shiny suits, standing next to a strange craft. The beings promptly fled into the craft which took off. The boys' encounter earned national news, especially when another witness was found.

“THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS.” On the night of August 10, 1962, “J” awoke to find his bedroom filled with light. Looking into the backyard of his home in Vienna, Virginia, he saw a small flying saucer, and next to it were three skinny figures with large bald heads, huge dark eyes, and gray skin. They were holding hands, and J had the strong impression they were his friends.

THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD. At 9:30 pm on July 19, 1967 Maria de Figueiredo picked corn from her father’s field in Sao Benedito do Sul, Brazil. Hearing a weird sound, she turned around and saw a three-foot-tall being staring at her. Behind him was a small craft with another being inside it. The being held up an ear of corn and gestured at her. As the being returned to the craft, Maria became terrified and promptly fainted.

“THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!” One evening in June of 1973, Louise Gaudet woke up in her home in Alma, Quebec, Canada hearing an engine noise and watching a green mist come into her room. Through the mist, she saw a small humanoid form wearing a silver suit and a helmet. It appeared twice, and in the days that followed, Louise began to have very unusual alien dreams.

“I FELT TRANSFIXED WITH FEAR.” As Phil Shepherdson drove his scooter to work one morning in February 1979 in Easingwold, UK, he was amazed to see a small craft landed alongside the road. Stopping to look at it, he saw two very thin humanoid figures standing next to it, and one inside it. All three stopped and looked at him. Suddenly he felt a strong telepathic connection with the beings. Phil was overcome with fear, and fled. Arriving at work, he discovered he was late, and may have had missing time.

ET SURVEILLANCE. On September 25, 1983, a young couple was camping out near Playa de Salgueiros, Portugal, when they were woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, they saw three craft and four humanoid figures. The humanoids began to walk around, surveying the field. For the next few hours, the craft remained flying back and forth as if looking for something, before finally leaving.

A HUMANOID BEHIND EACH WINDOW. On December 31, 1997, eight children decided to camp behind their homes in rural Kenwick, Western Australia. As one of them noticed strange streaks of red light in the distant sky, he called it to the attention of his friends. Suddenly a large craft zoomed towards them. And through the windows, they saw humanoids looking down at them.

THE PURPLE LIGHT BEING. On the night of December 21, 2004, a man and his nephew noticed a glowing object outside their home in Chillicothe, Ohio. Going to investigate, they were amazed when humanoid forms emerged from it, and one flew down and approached them. It was a glowing purple light being. The witness reached out and shook its hand. It then floated back and departed. Unknown to him, numerous people in the area were having encounters.

THE GIANT ALIEN. On the night of August 21, 2014, three friends decided to meditate in a field near their homes in Talavera de la Reina, Spain. Suddenly a glowing object appeared over their heads. Moments later, they were confronted by a giant figure at least 12 feet tall. When it started to chase them, all three men fled in fear. The next day, one of them found strange landing traces.

These ten cases show how truly strange and bizarre contact with UFO entities can be. So many different kinds of craft. So many varieties of humanoids. One thing that remains very consistent is that the experience always affects the witnesses profoundly, proving to them firsthand that we are not alone in this infinite universe.

This video presents the high strangeness ET contacts of Kelli Anderson (pseudonym) from southern California. Her story involves a wide variety of paranormal entities and events, including ghosts, extraterrestrials, UFOs and missing time, psychic and paranormal events, OBEs, nature spirits, precognition, orb visitations, weird owl stories, an apparent miracle and more.

Kelli Anderson was only eight years old when she experienced her first visitation by strange entities. She was living with her father, mother, and older sister in a rural home in Escondido. She was excited because she had just gotten her own room. One evening in 1968, she had just gone to bed and closed her eyes when a low rumbling sound filled the room followed by the sense of a presence, and a glowing red light illuminating the interior of her bedroom. Kelly was too afraid to open her eyes and lay there in terror until the presence departed. It was to be the first of many strange events. She found out that both her mother and grandmother had also reported a wide variety of paranormal activity. She herself became drawn towards spirituality.

At age eleven, a traumatic event altered the course of her life. Her parents moved to the town of Julian, and Kelli found herself in an isolated rural area surrounded by huge forests and mountains. It was the ideal place to heal from the recent terrible events she had endured. She developed a great love for nature, and especially trees. This led to a series of very unusual lucid dream encounters with a nature spirit. At the same time, she and her family experienced ghostly activity in their new home, and Kelli had more visitations by strange entities. She didn’t know who or what they were, but they did not appear to be human.

Then, at age twelve, Kelli had a dramatic UFO encounter that resulted in missing time. It was an encounter that would become buried in amnesia for many years. Not long after this, a disappointing Christmas morning led to one of the most miraculous events of her entire life, an encounter so strange, wonderful, and mysterious that to this very day she struggles to understand it. She continued to have more powerful premonitions and realized that she was exhibiting a strong psychic ability.

Then she met a Native American boy who lived on the nearby Santa Ysabel Indian Reservation. Spending lots of time there, she experienced more profoundly unusual and inexplicable events. Then, when her boyfriend joined the Army, they decided to get married so they could remain together. Kelli traveled with him to Germany, where she became pregnant. It was then that she was visited by strange troll-like entities who came into her bedroom and seemed to be interested in her unborn baby. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy, but as he grew up, he also began to complain of entities coming into his room too.

Time passed, and Kelli and her husband ending up getting a divorce. It was a difficult time in her life. That’s when Kelli had an experience with magical glowing orbs entering into her bedroom and bringing a sense of joy and love that healed her of her depression. But strange events continued, including a lifelong series of weird owl encounters. But soon, one incredibly profound and unusual owl experience would occur which left her and her children utterly amazed.

Driven to do more research to understand her encounters, Kelli learned that the Native Americans have some profoundly interesting theories regarding the nature of “little people” and aliens, and that many of them have encountered a wide variety of unusual entities. She soon realized that she was very likely an ET contactee, though she leaves her interpretations open as to what exactly this means. She also received a another visitation by the nature spirit from her childhood, who answered some of the many questions she had surrounding that very strange series of encounters.

Strange events continued, including her home filling with eerie blue and green light on multiple occasions, one of which was witnessed by a visiting friend. Kelli now accepts the fact that her life has always been filled with mysterious and supernatural events, and that such things a normal part of her life.

To explore more about Kelli’s amazing extraterrestrial and paranormal experiences (and those of many others) check out my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

UFOs appear in virtually all forms of media. Advertising, video-games, feature films, literature, radio, podcasts, social media platforms on the internet, and especially television. Countless documentaries, dramas, and reality TV shows have explored every facet of this subject. One form of television program that has prominently featured UFOs is the situation comedy.

Situation comedies first appeared on television in 1947, coinciding almost exactly with the dawn of the Modern Age of UFOs. Sitcoms are well-known for being accurate yardsticks measuring the current state of American culture. Sitcoms have the unique domain to express current values and morals. Whether it’s the wholesome family image of The Brady Bunch, or the satirical sarcasm of Married with Children, sitcoms broadcast a powerful message. They tell us what to wear, how to behave and what to believe in.

Sitcoms have tackled many controversial issues such as sexuality, crime, corruption, religion, economics, mental health, politics, racism, drugs, mortality, and more. And of course, one highly controversial subject covered by many sitcoms is the UFO phenomenon. Nearly every aspect of the UFO phenomenon has come under intense scrutiny and study. One avenue, however, that’s remained largely unexplored is how UFOs have been portrayed on situation comedies.

This video explores two dozen high-profile sitcoms that have had the courage to present this controversial subject, and then we will see what the treatment of this subject has to say about America’s attitude toward the UFO phenomenon. The sitcoms are presented chronologically in order of appearance, and reflect how Americans’ perception and understanding of UFOs changes over the decades.

It’s one of the most shocking and surprising experiences a person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid. It almost always has a profound impact on a witness, forever changing the way they think about the Universe. This video presents ten shocking alien encounters from across the planet, each providing important insights into the nature of extraterrestrial contact.

THE MAN IN THE SPHERE. In 1930, Yakov Tabunshikov was only thirteen when he stepped outside his home near Simferopol, Ukraine and witnessed an amazing sight: coming up behind the roof of his neighbor’s house was a transparent sphere, and inside it was a man in a white jumpsuit. Yakov watched in awe as the man in the sphere floated around the neighborhood and finally moved away. 

THE LITTLE BLUE MAN OF STUDHAM COMMON. On January 28, 1967, a group of young boys were playing outside their school in Studham Common, Bedfordshire, UK. Suddenly a little blue man in a glowing jumpsuit appeared. The boys ran towards him and he vanished in a puff of smoke. He soon reappeared and vanished again three more times, leaving behind an enduring mystery.

THE INDIFFERENT EXTRATERRESTRIALS. Around sunset on August 28, 1968, Juan Gascon del Toro was bicycling through a rural area of Aldaia, Spain when he came upon a landed UFO. Several humanoid figures in divers’ suits stood by it. Juan stopped his bike and stared in shock. Weirdly, the humanoids stared back at him and seemed not to care that they were being observed. Overcome with fear, Juan fled the scene.

THE VERY TALL ALIENS. On the evening of January 19, 1979, Andrea X was driving near Bastia, Italy when his car stalled. Getting outside to check the engine, he noticed two odd-looking figures standing nearby. He paid them no attention until the next day when he was driving in the same area and again his car stalled. The same two figures were there. Looking at them, he saw they were not human. His car would not start until the figures departed.

I NEARLY RAN OVER AN ALIEN. One evening in the Spring of 1980, a family of four was driving to their home in Cassville, Missouri when they saw a flying saucer landed in a field. As they watched it, suddenly a figure appeared in front of the car. It was a gray alien. The father had to swerve the car to avoid hitting it. This turned out to be one of a series of cases of landings and humanoids.

UFO LANDS IN FARMER’S FIELD. On the morning of September 4, 1987 farmers Armando and Rosa were in their beanfield in Balsamo, Brazil when a UFO appeared overhead. Rosa ran in fear, but Armando stayed outside and saw the craft come in for a landing. Then the craft tilted towards him and inside he saw two men in jumpsuits staring back at him. They had dark eyes, dark hair and looked like normal humans. Just then, his son arrived and the craft flew away.

THE TINY FLOATING MAN. One night in August 1991, El Vasco Landetcheverry and his daughter were watching TV in their home in Las Pipinas, Argentina when two bright lights appeared outside their home. Finally, El Vasco went outside to investigate. He walked into a wall of fog, and out of it floated a tiny little man the size of a coke bottle. It floated right up to him, stared at him, then floated back into the fog. The strange lights disappeared.

MEMORIES OF GRAYS. In 2001, “Alex,” (age 5) woke in the bedroom of his home in Norfolk, Virginia to see the room filling with blue light. To his shock, several small gray figures with bald heads and large dark eyes were in his room. This happened several times, and later, as a young man, Alex found himself in telepathic contact with one of the grays who imparted profound spiritual wisdom, changing his life forever.

“STAY CALM…IT’S ALRIGHT.” On the night of February 15, 2015, a woman woke in the bedroom of her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She thought she heard her boyfriend coming in, but instead it was an 8-foot-tall skinny being. The witness was scared at first, but then felt a sense of tranquility and love coming from the being. She was surprised by her own reaction of crawling back into bed as the strange creature disappeared.

THE TALE OF AN ALIEN WITH A TAIL. One sunny day in May 2016, Arfon Jones was driving along Tannyoky Road in County Armagh, Northern Ireland when he saw a strange figure standing in the road in front of him. He drove up to it, stopped his car and stared in amazement at a tall creature with a skinny muscular body, a bald head, large dark eyes, and a long tail like a rat. To his relief, the creature ran off into the bushes. But Arfon knew his life would never be the same.

These ten cases show the dazzling variety of humanoids that our visiting our planet. These experiences have been covered up for too long. But now, as the UFO subject goes mainstream, the truth is coming out. All humanity faces the fact that we are not alone in this universe.

UFO encounters are known for high strangeness. These eleven close encounters of the second kind all involve cases which affected the environment or the witnesses, in very unusual ways. These cases come from all over the world, and show how truly bizarre a close encounter can be. It appears that high strangeness might be an intentional feature which encourages witnesses to consider new paradigms and explore new ways of thinking.

MAY CAUSE UNCONTROLLABLE MOVEMENTS. Little is known about this case, which occurred on November 10, 1957 to a man from Madison, Ohio. While watching a low altitude UFO, he experienced uncontrollable movement of his hand, which would fly up of its own accord to his face. Afterwards, he suffered from eye irritation.

THE UFO ZONE OF SILENCE. One day in the Summer of 1965, “Susan” and a friend were playing badminton at RAF Chicksands, a satellite communications base in Bedfordshire, UK, when both girls realized they had become completely deaf. Looking up, they saw a low-flying UFO. Others came outside to view it and experienced the total silence. Seven other military bases were visited that day.

KNOCKED DOWN BY A UFO. On the night of November 1, 1966, Mrs. Tibbetts was in her Newfield, New Hampshire home when her son Dale ran inside to report a UFO hovering outside. Looking out the window, Mrs. Tibbetts saw a huge craft just above her rooftop. Seconds later, it struck her with a beam of light, knocking her down and causing persistent eye irritation.

ROCK-DROPPING UFO. On the evening of December 13, 1973, Patrick Thrush (16) was driving to a friend’s home in Bradenton, Florida when he saw what he thought was a plane crashing. Pulling over, he saw it was a silver craft sending down a beam of light into the river. As he snapped two photos, it zoomed at him and dropped three small stones, one of which hit his car.

UFO MAKES WAVES. On the night of March 29, 1974, a couple were on the beach at Lome, in Togo, Africa when a strange craft zoomed in from the ocean. As it hovered above the water, it created a depression on the surface and sent huge waves onto the beach. Then the couple was struck by a hot beam of light from the UFO which paralyzed them. Afterwards, the man experienced vertigo, deafness and fainting.

UFO LANDS AT TOBACCO FARM. On July 6, 1975, tobacco farmer Joe Borda saw silver dome-shaped UFO sitting in the field of his farm in Mount Pleasant, Ontario, Canada. Strangely, he ignored it and forgot about it. But two days later, going to where it had landed, he found a large circle of crushed and burned plants, and two weird oily deposits. Later, strange voices and other high strangeness events would occur.

TRANSFORMED BY A UFO. On the evening of October 1, 1977, Martin Rodriguez was playing with friends near their homes in Tordesillas, Spain when he came upon a landed UFO. Stepping towards it, he was struck by a beam of light. Upon awakening, he suffered from vomiting, dizziness, vision problems, and fainting. He was diagnosed with hydrocephaly, and had many surgeries. He also experienced a mysterious boost in his intelligence.

THE UFO THAT OPENED THE WINDOW. On April 12, 1979, at the tail-end of a UFO wave, a family was driving to their home in Brockton, Massachusetts when a UFO appeared overhead. Suddenly all the windows of their car started opening and closing. The UFO followed them home, continuing its window shenanigans. As the father and son exited the car, both were struck by a beam of light from the craft.

“A UFO SAVED MY LIFE.” As a little girl living on a farm in rural Canton, Ohio, Julie Riggs had a close-up UFO sighting that left her with psychic gifts and a strong connection to the ETs. Later in life, around 1980, she was harassed and then chased in her car by two strangers. As she sped to get away, a UFO appeared and led her off the highway, just in time to avoid hitting an abandoned vehicle on the road.

UFO BEAMS FOUR BOYS. One night in the early 1980s, as four young boys from rural White Horse, Yukon Territory, Canada went for a walk in the woods, they were confronted by a large craft. It moved towards them, hovered overhead, and sent down a beam of light directly in their group. The boys flung themselves to the ground and the craft moved off. The main witness reports that the encounter changed his life forever.

A MINIATURE UFO. One evening in October 2016, a 73-year-old man was walking through a golf course in Worthing, UK when he came upon a shiny silver cylinder about the size of a soda can. He tried to pick it up, but was unable. As he nudged it with his foot, it took off, throwing him back with a strange force. It zipped away, leaving no trace behind.

These high strangeness cases make it clear that there is still much we don’t understand about UFOs and these mysterious visitors to our planet. They do make one thing very clear: we are being visited by something not from this planet.

The challenge continues! Name any town or city, and the chances are almost 100% that a UFO encounter has occurred there. In early 2024, I put out this challenge. So far, there have been cases in every single location. Episode six presents ten new locations, each with a history of encounters. These locations include Benson, Arizona; Greensboro, North Carolina; Edwardsburg, Michigan; Bedfordshire, UK; Chicoutimi, Canada; Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Asheville, North Carolina; Skagway/Juneau, Alaska and Bradenton, Florida. Sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences, many supported by evidence such as photos, radar-returns, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, and more! The truth can no longer be denied: UFOs are real!

BENSON, AZ. In 1952, flight commander Chick Logan and many others were at Marana Airbase when a UFO appeared overhead. Chick took off in his plane to intercept the object. Although it was too high to reach, he did verify that it was not a balloon. Four years later in 1956, a fleet of a dozen objects move over Benson, alerting the Ground Observers Corp. In 2022, a Benson resident captured an anomalous light on an automatic camera outside his home.

GREENSBORO, NC. In May 1930, Joseph Rankin and his wife were shocked when a UFO landed in the backyard. Even more shocking, they saw a humanoid inside. In 1946, two solders had a closeup observations of three disc-shaped objects. More sightings occurred in 1952, 1955, 1963 and 1966. That same year, teenager David Oldham was taken onboard a craft and examined by gray-type ETs. The sightings continued, including several photographic cases.

EDWARDSBURG, MI. This small town produced a few dramatic case, including three events in 2008 alone, each involving solid objects moving in anomalous ways. In one case, a gentleman described a triangular craft which swooped mere feet above his car. In 2022, a man saw what he thought was a shooting star, until it made a right turn and zipped up and away.

BEDFORDSHIRE, UK. In 1956, shopkeeper John Whitworth was visited by an unusual-looking gentleman who gave him directions to a UFO sighting, beginning a strange adventure that almost led to direct contact. One year later, pilot John Jordan had two close-up sightings in a row. In 1962, two young sisters watched a UFO hover over their backyard, and inside they saw two humanoids. Many other cases, including an entire family who experienced missing time.

CHICOUTIMI, QUEBEC, CANADA. In April 1968, Mrs. Tremblay saw a UFO outside her home, and minutes later, saw a short humanoid. In 1970, Mrs. Desneige described a UFO which hovered directly above her neighbor’s home. In 2013, another witness saw a strange cylindrical object moving overhead at high speed.

DALLAS-FORT WORTH, TX. In 1947, a woman saw a UFO with occupants who stopped their craft to wave at her. In 1958, a young girl said a gray-type ET stared at her from her bedroom window. In 1972, a family in Dallas saw a 30-foot-wide UFO being chased by jets. In 1974, Dallas-Fort Worth Airport experienced a wave of sightings. More cases, including an onboard experience, an apparent dog-man, and possible ETs walking among us!

ASHEVILLE, NC. In 1947, a sighting over a park in Asheville kicked off the modern age of UFOs. Dramatic sightings continued in 1957, 1974, 1977, 1987 and 1989. These are not just anomalous lights, but solid craft seen by multiple witnesses. In 2013, Reverend Michael Carter was visited by a human-looking ET who cured him of a severe blood-clot in his leg. So many cases!

SKAGWAY/JUNEAU, AK. Way back in 1916, numerous people saw a UFO from the decks of the Steamer, Georgia. In 1969, two other sailors found their boat, The Teel, disabled by a low flying craft. A sighting in 1973 impressed several witnesses, and in 1980 the small town of Kate experienced a dramatic UFO display. In 1996, a Skagway woman had a closeup brush with a UFO that resulted in missing time.

BRADENTON, FL. Several military personnel experienced dramatic close-up encounters in 1949 and 1955. Very unusual sightings were reported in 1957 and 1959. In 1971, a police officer reported a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid asking about the wars on our planet. More cases in 2002, 2003 and 2006 make is clear that Bradenton is of interest to the ETs.

These ten locations, provide by you the viewers, show once again that UFOs are ubiquitous, and that ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity campaign to announce their presence. With so many cases and so much evidence, the time for skepticism is over. The truth can no longer be hidden, distorted, ignored, or denied. UFOs are real and we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

Thousands of people have had the experience, if not millions: a face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials. Cases come from all over the world, and they share profound commonalities and differences. It appears that the humanoid form is the universal template. And yet, many cases have rare or unique elements of high strangeness that defy comprehension. This article/video presents ten cases of this kind. These cases have much to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and these strange visitors to our planet.

THEY CAME BACK. One night in September of 1951, Louise McDougall, her husband and three friends sat on the lawn of their homes in Bloomington, California. Sensing somebody looking at her, Louise saw a disc-shaped craft with portholes hover overhead. Through the portholes, she saw four human-looking men in jumpsuits looking down at her. She grabbed her flashlight and shone it at the craft, causing it to dart away. But 15 minutes later, it was back again!

“WE RAN AS FAST AS WE COULD.” One summer day in 1958, 11-year-old Hilary Porter and her friend Janet were walking near their homes in Farnborough, UK when a  silver craft appeared overhead. It promptly descended, a door opened, and a tall humanoid figure appeared in the doorway. After a few moments of shock, the girls fled. Soon, Hilary would learn that she was a UFO contactee.

HUMANOIDS IN GOSHEN. On the night of October 19, 1973, Mrs. Wright reported a UFO over her home in Goshen, Ohio. Researcher Charles Wilhelm arrived to visit her, but instead interviewed her neighbor, “Sam,” who described coming upon a landed UFO and humanoids. He wasn’t the only witness. Two weeks later and a short distance away, Don Brandenburg came upon a landed UFO. Later that night, a Mrs. Gilbert saw a strange humanoid in the exact same spot.

THE GOFFSTOWN VISITATIONS. On the afternoon of November 4, 1973, Rex Snow of Goffstown, New Hampshire (and his neighbors) saw a flying saucer. That night, an odd light filled his backyard. Looking outside, he saw two humanoids in silver jumpsuits collecting samples from his yard. Three days earlier and 6 miles away, Florence Dow was scared by the appearance of a faceless humanoid on her porch. Six hours later, Lyndia Morel had a scary encounter with a UFO and humanoid in Goffstown. Meanwhile, police stations across the state were flooded with UFO calls.

THE MONK-LIKE ALIENS. On the night of November 13, 1973, Ann Dolphijn Vermeulen woke to see three strange humanoid figures outside the window of her home in Uden, Netherlands. She watched them for five minutes as they walked down the street and move away. Returning to her bedroom and looking out the window, she saw a large glowing red sphere.

THE GLOWING MEN. At 6:30 on August 15, 1981, more than twenty people who worked at the La Rochelle estate in Zimbabwe were amazed by the appearance of a glowing sphere and two to four glowing humanoid figures in white jumpsuits. Panic reigned as several witnesses fled into the forests. Others stayed to see the sphere move around the estate. Soon the figures left, leaving behind an enduring mystery.

IT CAME FROM THE SKY. One day in spring 2003, three cement truck drivers arrived at their destination in Reinoso de Cerrato, Spain just in time to see a bizarre-looking humanoid descend from the sky and stand on the ground 30 feet away. The being was 5 feet tall, dressed in a jumpsuit, but its head appeared to be composed only of a hollow transparent ring. After a few moments, the figure flew back upwards and disappeared into the distance.

THE ALIENS BY THE MEGALITHS. One day in February 2008, two women were visiting Ile de Berder, France to see the many mysterious megalithic structures at this location. Instead they saw a strange glowing sphere followed by the appearance of four gray ETs. One of the witnesses was left with the impression that she was being warned about the dangers of nuclear power.

THE ALIEN IN MY BEDROOM. On the night of November 9, 2013, “Melissa,” was in the bedroom of her home in Virginia Beach, VA when a strange feeling overcame her. Looking up, she saw a tall gray-skinned humanoid appear in her room. She was unable to move as it approached. She felt herself being drawn upwards and blacked out. The next morning, her brother complained about the dogs barking furiously and a brilliant light appearing outside the home.

THE WITHLACOOCHEE ET. On the night of April 2, 2015, “Philip” was driving an 18-wheeler truck on State Road 41 in the Withlacoochee Forest in Florida when he noticed a short, uniformed figure holding a strange device standing alongside the road. As he passed by, he saw that it did not appear to be human. This turned out to be one of several encounters occurring in this area.

Ten cases, each providing more evidence of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. The truth can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. We are being visited by ETs.

It has been called the ultimate UFO encounter, the closest of all encounters: an onboard UFO experience. There are thousands of well-documented cases, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. These cases of direct contact with ETs involve extensive interactions and contain more information about the extraterrestrials than any other kind of encounter. Here are six shocking cases from across the world: Australia, Canada, France and three from the United States. The UFO phenomenon is so much more than just simple sightings of unexplained lights in the sky. It’s about meeting people from other worlds.

“I WAS IN A UFO.” In 1972, “Steve” (age 24) was staying in a cabin in the wilderness of Cariboo, British Columbia, Canada. One summer day, he stepped outside and was amazed to see two silver discs fly at treetop level a few hundred feet away. He somehow knew they were going to land and that he had to go meet them. He asked his girlfriend to join him, but she strangely refused. Steve went alone and came upon the two craft, landed on the ground. One had an open door and a ramp leading to the ground. Curious, Steve approached and entered. Inside he saw two short humanoids with gray wrinkled skin, wearing white doctors’ smocks. Afraid, he was about to run when one spoke telepathically in perfect English, “It’s okay, come on in.” So began an extensive onboard experience that Steve would keep secret for most of his life.

TAKEN IN TARBORO. James Howard (age 15) and his friend Brian Hollis (age 14) had been seeing odd lights near their homes in Tarboro, NC for a few weeks. Then, on the night of November 12, 1976, they saw a metallic, disc-shaped craft with colored lights land in the forest nearby. Going to investigate, they became frightened when a glowing, white-suited humanoid figure appeared. When they arrived home, more than an hour had passed. James began having nightmares of being onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled that both he and Brian were floated up into the craft, separated and given medical exams.

YURANI. It was a warm night in July 1981 as “Robert” (age 16) played frisbee with his dog outside his home in Seattle, Washington. Suddenly, clouds rolled in and Robert saw colored lights overhead. He now found himself unable to move as a warm beam of light pulled him up into the craft. He recalled seeing a being with cat-like eyes, then woke up the next morning in bed. Years later, he recalled a long onboard experience where he was met by a hybrid human-gray who introduced herself as Yurani. She told him that she was more than 200 years old, and began to impart a lot of information about why the ETs were visiting Earth. At one point, Robert was taken to their home planet.

SEVEN HOURS ONBOARD AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT. Eduardo Pons Prades was a famous political author in Spain when, on the night of August 31, 1981, his life changed forever. He was driving through the Pyrenees in France when he became weirdly lost and his car mysteriously stalled. Walking down a narrow country road, he came upon a large craft landed in a field. A door opened and a commanding voice spoke to him telepathically: “Don’t be afraid. Please approach…Come up to our ship. We wish to speak with you.” Unable to resist, Eduardo went onboard and was greeted by a group of beautiful human-looking people in white jumpsuits. They told him that they had contacted him because of his expertise in human violence, and that he needed to give the world a message.

“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.” One night in March 1982, an anonymous woman driving near Springfield, Missouri noticed a strange light at treetop level ahead of her car. At that moment, she seemed to lose control of the steering wheel and felt like her car was floating. The next thing she knew, she was parked next to a huge craft landed in field. She was drawn onboard and was greeted by six tall, strong, human-looking figures with blue eyes and blonde hair. They examined her and said that they were researching human reproduction. They said that they were her friends and would see her again.

“WHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR?” One night in 1986, three young men were camping in the wilderness outside of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia when they heard a strange noise overhead. Looking up, a brilliant light approached and descended, revealing itself to be a silver disc-shaped craft. Two little beings appeared underneath and approached the men, who found themselves now unable to move. All three men were floated up into the craft and subjected to a strange examination involving lights. The ETs were friendly and smiling as the witnesses were given a tour of the craft and soon saw something which left them speechless with wonder.

Six shocking onboard UFO encounters, each providing profound insights into the nature and origins of extraterrestrials, each providing answers about the ET agenda on our planet. We are not alone!

While there are still those who remain skeptical of UFOs and extraterrestrials, there are many who not only believe, they KNOW. They have moved beyond belief to actual experiential knowledge. A firsthand encounter with extraterrestrials changes the way a person views the universe. They know beyond doubt that we are not alone in this universe. And a lot of people have had this kind of experience. This video presents ten firsthand accounts of people who have met humanoids face-to-face. These cases come from all over the world. They show that we are not the only people in this universe. We are one of many!

THE ALIENS AND THE SHEPHERD BOY. In the Summer of 1938, Mariano Melgar, a seven-year-old shepherd boy from Munico, Spain was minding his family’s herd of cows when an ET craft landed nearby. A door opened and three men stepped out. Mariano approached to get a closer look and one of them shot him with a beam of light. Mariano thought they might be from another country. Later he would change his mind.

USO AND HUMANOID AT LAKE LANGELMAVESI. When Ilona Johansson-Paasonen went to enjoy a vacation in August 1945 at Lake Langelmavesi, Finland, she was awakened one morning by light blazing into her room. Looking outside, she saw a fiery object zoom towards her. She dove to the ground in fear. Peering outside again, she saw two figures in a boat that clearly was not normal. Weirdly, she passed out.

THE ALIENS AT THE WATER FOUNTAIN. On the night of December 24, 1950, ten-year-old Antonietta Chiara was sent outside her home in Cossoine, Italy to fetch a pail of water. Going to the nearby fountain, she saw three thin humanoid figures with oversized heads and big dark eyes, and all three were staring right at her. Realizing they were not human, she panicked and fled.

THE MEN IN THE TRANSPARENT SPHERE. On the night of October 18, 1968, three people were enjoying dinner in their home in Medulla, Florida when suddenly the TV quit and the dog freaked out. Looking outside, they saw a transparent sphere floating near their house. And inside it were two short men working a strange device. Little did they know, people all over the area were seeing UFOs.

A UFO REPAIR CASE. One night in February 1970, Leona Nielsen and her friend were staying in a cabin near Coram, Montana when a light outside caught their attention, and they saw a classic flying saucer landed along the river shore. It seemed to be in trouble and was shooting out colored sparks over a wide area, while two human-looking figures rushed around it. Leona had the impression that the craft was damaged.

THE ETS ON THE SIDEWALK. It was 11pm on June 18, 1980 as Antonio D’Amico walked along a sidewalk in the small village of Barrancas, Argentina. Suddenly he noticed two short humanoids wearing skintight luminous jumpsuits standing a short distance away. Both were staring at him. Fearful, Antonio decided to leave. But to his shock, the strange figures followed.

ALIEN ROBOT ON THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND. One afternoon in mid-April 1990, five children were on the playground of the Yerevan Primary School #111 in Yerevan, Armenia when a spherical object landed behind the school. Three robotic beings came out. One approached the students and spoke to them about the future of their country, but not before striking one with a beam of light and levitating another boy.

ALIENS AT SUMMER CAMP. It was 1991, the last night at summer-camp for a group of girls in Pelrhimov, Czech Republic. As they sat around the bonfire, a brilliant beam of light shone down on them. It was a UFO! The camp leaders ordered all the girls to their tents. But shortly later, a few of them sneaked out and came face-to-face with three tall humanoids in divers’ suits. The UFO remained overhead.

THE ETS BY THE CHAPEL. On the night of December 27, 2006, a college student was walking by the chapel at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, Africa when a glowing egg-shaped craft dropped from the sky and landed in front of her. Moments later, an ET emerged. The student was unable to move as two more figures appeared, then one of them approached her. Thankfully, two other students came on the scene.

THE HUNTERS BECOME THE HUNTED. It was 3am on December 12, 2011, as three hunters and one of their sons were hiking back to their car after hunting in Kaimai Ranges of New Zealand. When a glowing object appeared overhead, they became puzzled. When it moved closer and revealed itself to be a craft, they became concerned. Shortly later, they came face to face with a strange humanoid that would leave them all shaken.

These ten cases provide just a brief glimpse into the nature of contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. The truth is that there are thousands upon thousands of cases, each of them unique, each providing another piece of the puzzle that is the UFO mystery. The only thing we know for sure is that UFOs are real, and we are not alone in this universe.

UFOs are ubiquitous! They are seen everywhere on our planet. Every town, every city, everywhere! In Part Five of this ongoing you the viewers have provided nine new locations to investigate and find UFO cases. And once again, research shows that UFOs have left no place behind. Eugene, Oregon----Homewood, Illinois----Niagara Falls, New York & Ontario Canada----Glenwood, MN----Helena, MT----Tucson, Arizona----Monterey, CA---Rotherham, UK: all of them have been visited by extraterrestrials. That includes sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences, with many cases supported by evidence including photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more. We are not alone!

EUGENE, OREGON shows a long UFO history. In 1947, a married couple had a dramatic encounter with a low-level UFO. In July of 1955, the audience of a drive-in movie theater in Eugene witnessed a dazzling UFO display. Cases in 1959, 1960, 1971 and 1976, 1982, 1986, 1986—most involving multiple witnesses, including police. In 2015, a Eugene woman saw gray aliens in her bedroom. In 2016 a witness captured startling photos of a UFO.
HOMEWOOD, ILLINOIS is a suburb of Chicago with a few impressive accounts. On April 28, 1952, two witnesses observed a silver-white dome-shaped object flying circles around an airplane. They called the US Army Regional office who routed the case to Blue Book. But the Air Force wasn’t interested! On November 8, 1973, three sightings hit the Chicago area, including Homewood, and then moved over a shopping center!

NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK & ONTARIO, CANADA have been visited many times. A very early and impressive sighting occurred in 1833. All throughout the 1950s numerous sightings occurred , many involving military witnesses. In 1955, two families picnicking near the falls saw a USO emerge from Lake Erie. They all saw humanoids inside the craft. In 1958, a woman saw a UFO landed by the highway, leaving landing traces. In 1960, a young man had a UFO talk to him, then follow him home and take him onboard. In 1963, airport tower personnel saw a UFO which Project Blue Book said was just a balloon! More cases throughout the 1970s to the 2000s!

GLENWOOD, MINNESOTA was visited on September 25, 1954 when dozens of people over a wide area reported UFOs. In 2003, Cindy Lou Schmidt not only saw a UFO from the porch of her Glenwood home, she managed to capture a photograph of it. MUFON field investigators declared the case unknown.

HELENA, MONTANA had sighting way back in 1947 when a massive fleet of 12 objects flew over the city. In 1973, cement truck driver John Struble was at Flesher Pass when a UFO sent down a beam of light disabling his truck and scaring the daylights out of him. In 1976, numerous people across Helena called the police to say that UFOs were zooming over the city.

TUCSON, ARIZONA is the location of hundreds of encounters. Here we look at nearly a dozen cases involving humanoids and onboard encounters. In 1952, a woman hiking outside of Tucson saw a UFO, then a gray walk up to her and she then found herself inside a craft. In 1960, Charlie Green was pulled out of his home by four grays. Unknown to him, someone outside his home watched him being taken. In 1977, a woman saw a UFO land next to the Veterans Hospital. A silver-suited humanoid came out and pulled her onboard, holding a long conversation with her. In 1981, a woman saw a UFO outside her home, was taken onboard and saw three different types of ETs. In 2001, a teenage boy made a wish to see an alien, and moments later saw a flying humanoid. In 2007, a woman sent a telepathic hello to a UFO. That night, she found herself being visited by humanoids.

MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA has several impressive encounters. In April 10, 1950, numerous policemen saw had a daylight encounter with a shiny silver disc. Even a prisoner saw it! In 1950, a train engineer had a dramatic encounter as a UFO paced his train. In 1967, a UFO hovered 100 feet over a farmhouse. In 1973, a low-level UFO was viewed by police. That same year, Fort Hunter-Liggett Army base had a very dramatic encounter and also possibly a UFO crash with bodies. In 1974, several residents of an apartment building all called the police to report a fast-moving egg-shaped object. In 2017, a “cloaked” cylindrical craft moved over the city.

ROTHERHAM, UK was the location of a spooky humanoid goat-man seen back in 1937. The years of 1977, 1981, 1987, 1988 and 1997 produced many spectacular cases. More cases occur, even as late as 2001 when witnesses reported a craft moving with a strange pendulum motion.
The cases speak for themselves. All over the world UFOs are being seen. UFO activity is far more common and widespread than previously thought. It appears that the ETs want us to know they are here! The truth is obvious: UFOs are seen all over the planet, including your own hometown.

While there are still many questions surrounding the origin of UFOs and their occupants, the most popular theory is that they are from the stars, in other words: extraterrestrial. This video presents twelve cases from across the world involving a wide variety of ETs. These reports are supported by a wide variety of evidence: photos, medical effects, landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more. It’s time for this subject to be taken seriously by everyone on this planet.

THE HUMANOID IN THE FIREBALL. One evening in the Summer of 1961, “Mike” (age 7) was camping with his buddy in the backyard of his home in Anaheim, California. Suddenly a fiery object swooped down and hovered overhead. Inside, he saw a humanoid figure looking down at him.

THE ALIEN UNDER THE BRIDGE. A summer day in 1963, a group of children were playing in a park in Lesnica, Poland when a silver-suited short humanoid appeared next to them. Time seemed to move in slow motion as the figure gestured at them to come closer. The children fled, and refused to return to the park again.

THE LITTLE ETS IN THE TINY UFO. On November 15, 1969, Madame X looked out the window of her apartment in downtown Nancy, France and saw a tiny UFO glide towards her window, stop and hover. Inside she saw two tiny little ETs smiling and looking right at her. It zoomed away. Afterward, the witness discovered her face had been slightly burned.

VISITORS TO EARTH. One summer night in 1972, a lady from Oslo, Norway saw a large saucer-shaped craft with big picture windows hovering at treetop level. Even more shocking, she saw humanoid figures bustling about inside. Oddly, although other people were around, she seemed to be the only one to see it!

A UFO PARKED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. Late at night on September 6, 1973, two people drove along the Eyre Highway near Penong, South Australia. The passenger was asleep when a telepathic voice woke her up. Looking outside, she saw a UFO parked alongside the road. One humanoid stood next to it, and another was visible through a window.

THE ALIENS ON THE BEACH. One day in June 1975, a couple walked along Playa de Marin Beach in Spain when three UFOs appeared, landed on the beach, and out came three short humanoids dressed in jumpsuits. The three beings converged and then returned to their craft. One of the witnesses tried to communicate telepathically, but got a bad headache.

THE LITTLE MAN IN THE SILVER SUIT. One night in October 1977, Jose Benedito Santos (age 78) was hunting near Chapada das Mesas, Brazil when a glowing object landed near him. He approached and saw a short humanoid wearing a silver suit and helmet. It walked right up to him, and Jose promptly fainted. When he awoke, he found a weird mark on his neck.

THE ETS ON THE BALCONY. When four people drove near Danville, California one evening in summer of 1979, they were amazed to see a glowing object pace their car. They stopped and watched as the object came lower, revealing itself to be a saucer-shaped craft. On a balcony surrounding the craft, they saw several very tall humanoid figures. Later, they learned many people saw UFOs in that area on that night.

CONVERSATION WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL. On the night of August 24, 1985, a couple (both doctors) drove along Route 12 near Ituzaingo, Argentina when a UFO blocked the road. A beautiful man dressed in a jumpsuit walked up to their window and held a long conversation with them. He told them he was from another planet, and that the people of Earth needed to know that we are not alone.

THE ALIEN FROM THE BLACK SPHERE. Throughout 1988-1989, a farming couple from San Piero a Sieve, Italy experienced repeated visits by a flying humanoid which would arrive in black sphere. It warned them to keep away, but then damaged their crops. After several visits, the husband rushed forward to stop the ET. It quickly struck him with a beam of light. That was the final visit.

A NIGHT IN THE TREE WITH ALIENS. On May 17, 1997, three teenage boys became lost in the wilderness of La Rumorosa, Mexico. Taking refuge in a tree for the night, a saucer appeared overhead, followed shortly by several glowing short humanoids. The humanoids soon discovered the boys and actually climbed the tree to observe them. The witnesses' lives were profoundly changed forever.

THE ET WHO WALKED ON WATER. One day in 1999, a man was hiking next to a pond in a natural area near Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada when he saw a tall humanoid figure in a white jumpsuit and helmet floating inches above the water. Suddenly it noticed him and glided across the surface of the water, running off into the forest.

These 12 cases alone make it undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials, but the truth is that there are thousands of more cases. It is no longer possible to deny the truth of the ET presence on our planet. The evidence is clear: we are not alone!

Some UFO encounters are so incredibly weird, that after it occurs people can hardly believe that it actually happened! This episode presents eight cases from across the world of truly high strangeness, each involving close encounters of the second kind, in which the environment is affected in some way. Many of these cases have multiple witnesses, and virtually all of them involve some form of evidence: radar confirmation, photographs, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances. These are the kinds of cases that simply cannot be denied.

UFO COLLIDES INTO A HOUSE. On April 23, 1966, Jeanne Kalnicki and her six kids were shocked to see a UFO hovering right outside their home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. It fact, it was so close, they thought it might hit them. It moved off, but just a few hours later, it was back, and this time it ran right into the side of their apartment building, causing the whole structure to vibrate and the power to go out. And this was just one of many sightings occurring in this area at that time.

A UFO WITH A MESSAGE. The night of December 12, 1967 would change the life of Rita Malley forever. As she drove with her young son near Ithaca, New York, a UFO began to follow her down the highway. Suddenly it struck her car with a beam of light, pulling it off the road. Then chorus of voices spoke to her, delivering a message that would chill her to the bone. The very next day, Rita learned that the message from the UFO was absolutely accurate. This case was just one of hundreds in the same area around the same time.

A VERY HOT UFO. Around 10:50 pm on August 13, 1970, patrolman Evald Maarup was driving near Haderslev, Denmark when his car and the surrounding area became illuminated by a blindingly brilliant light. As the engine and electrical system failed, Evald looked up and saw a UFO right above his car. Suddenly the interior of his vehicle became hot as a summer day. As it finally darted away, he managed to capture three photos of the object. Soon the UFOs would return, not only to him, but to others!

A SILVER UFO WITH PRONGS. One evening in October 1973, Mary Rose and her 11-year-old son Teddy were walking near their home in Wilcoe, West Virginia when a UFO dropped down and hovered a telephone-pole height overhead. Fear filled them as they watched two prong-like things come out from the bottom of the craft. Both could feel a weird sensation of heat and electricity, and thought that they were about to be taken into the craft. They ran and hid, and to their relief, the UFO darted away.

STRUCK BY A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM A UFO. Around dusk on June 17, 1977, Dale Schexnaider, and two children, Jena (age 14) and Krissy (age 11) were walking to their car at Cotile Lake in Louisiana when a UFO appeared. Suddenly it came right over their heads, sending down multiple beams of light which struck them on the solar plexus. They were unable to move and saw with shock that their entire bodies were glowing with electric-blue light. Hours later, a tragic event occurred which seemed connected to their sighting in some indefinable way.

ALIEN FOOTPRINTS? On the night of September 4, 1979, Jerzy Wasilewski left his 4th floor apartment in Wroclaw, Poland to take a short walk. He left his kitchen window open. Returning later, he was shocked to see 17 strange footprints leading from the open window, meandering around his kitchen and hallway, and going back to the open window. The prints looked like burn-marks from some strange creature. But a later analysis revealed that these prints were something much more strange and inexplicable.

I WAS TRYING HARD TO HOLD ONTO REALITY. On the night of March 8, 1982, “John” and his wife were in their home in Bethel, Connecticut when the whole house began to shake. Fearing an earthquake, they ran outside only to be confronted by a massive shadowy object with scores of tiny red lights lining its edges. John later found out that there were dozens of other witnesses in the area, some who saw the same object and also reported very strange effects.

HIGH STRANGENESS IN SLOCINA. At 10:42 pm on December 27, 2013, Ewa looked outside the window of her home in Slocina, Poland and saw a huge glowing UFO at treetop level. She called to her mother, Anna and both watched the object approach. Suddenly the sound from their loud radio disappeared and time seemed to move in slow motion. As the craft passed over a streetlamp, it pulled the light away from the streetlamp, as if it had some kind of forcefield that could bend light.

These eight case, all close encounters of the second kind, show that UFOs can affect the environment (and the witnesses) in weird and unusual ways that defy comprehension. Cases like these have much to teach us about these strange craft visiting our planet, and the behavior of the occupants inside them.

A close encounter of third kind: meetings with humanoids. This happens more often than most people think. There are thousands upon thousands of cases on record, coming from all over the world. This episode presents ten cases of extraterrestrial humanoid encounters you probably haven’t heard before. Short and tall humanoids, human-looking ETs, robotic beings, grays…and more. Each case reveals remarkable insights into the nature of UFO contact, what they are doing, and why they are here.

PLANT-PICKING ETS. One morning in July 1954, Harold Carpenter woke up to hear a buzzing noise coming from the woods near his home in Temple Ewell, England. When it happened several times, he went to investigate, and came upon a landed UFO and five short humanoids. They were using tweezer-like instruments to place twigs and leaves in small jars. Seeing Harold, they fled into their craft, and flew off.

SOMETHING ABNORMAL. Driving near Girona, Spain one night in October 1958, Jose Luis Angelo observed a UFO descend into the forest. Suspecting a plane crash, he pulled over and ventured into the forest. Instead, he came upon a UFO hovering above the ground. Next to it were two short, large-headed humanoids wearing jumpsuits. He watched for 15 minutes until they returned to their craft and departed.

I WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE! As 13-year-old Maria Ivanovna returned to her home in Vitebsk, Belarus one day in July of 1963, she saw two metallic discs overhead. Suddenly her 4-year-old brother ran towards them, and one of the discs swooped down apparently to pick him up. Maria’s sister grabbed him and pulled him away just in time. But they were all close enough to see a four-foot-tall humanoid sitting inside a transparent dome on top of the craft.

THE WINSTED ENCOUNTERS. On the night of September 15, 1967, two teen-age girls looked out the window and saw a glowing UFO crisscrossing the fields behind one of their homes in Winsted, Connecticut. Moments later, they heard a noise in the barn, and saw two short humanoids with big heads run across their yard. Soon a third one appeared. This was just the first of a wave of encounters that put Winsted on the UFO map.

BLUE RIDGE HUMANOID. On the night of March 1, 1974, Billy Wayne Plasters saw an odd glow on the hill near his farm in Vesta, Virginia. Alerting his family, they all observed a strange craft ascend and dart away. When the strange glow remained, Billy and his brother-in-law drove to the area and came upon a landed craft and a tall “well-built” humanoid. They tried to talk to it, but when it moved towards them, they panicked and fled. Later, they found a huge burned spot.

THE SHINY SILVER SEWICKLEY HUMANOID. In January of 1974, numerous people across central Pennsylvania reported UFOs. Many reported that they were chased down the highway by strange craft. But events came to a climax on the night of March 24 when a young man was motorcycling in a rural area of Sewickley and caught a tall, silver-clad humanoid figure by surprise. The figure crouched and then darted away, leaving behind strange footprints.

THE SWEET-SMELLING ALIEN. Hearing footsteps outside his home in Villorba, Italy on the night of June 25, 1974, Mr. DP went outside and saw his cat was bristling with fear. He also smelled a strange sweet odor. Sensing a presence, he was then shocked by the appearance of a glowing humanoid in a shiny skin-tight jumpsuit. The strange being quickly floated up into the sky and was gone. Mr. DP was stunned and after his encounter, had a headache that persisted for a full week.

THE ET WITH THE FLASHING EYES. At 9pm one evening in July 1975, Carmen B stepped outside of her home in St. Dizier, France to hang her laundry. Without warning, the yard was flooded with light. Turning around, she saw a short humanoid staring at her. It had a huge head and large flashing eyes that left her hypnotized and paralyzed with fear. She almost fainted from shock, but managed to break free and flee into the house.

THE ETS IN THE FOREST. On the afternoon of February 14, 1984, a group of young children playing in the Tuchola Forest near their homes in Linowek, Poland saw a small craft descend downward. At least two metallic-looking short humanoids frightened the children who fled to their homes. Investigators had the children draw what they saw. Later, landing traces were found.

AN INTERRUPTED JOURNEY. At 4:30 pm on August 25, 1999, mechanic Carlos Colon’s truck mysteriously stalled along National Route 5 near Trenque Lauquen, Argentina. Five tall figures in a glowing dome appeared in front of him. Suddenly, the beings turned away and they disappeared. Carlos found himself standing in a field some distance away. After the encounter, numerous psychic and paranormal events occurred.

Ten more cases showing once more that we are not alone in the Universe. It’s time for the world to face this fact. UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are here!

Welcome to Episode Four of my ongoing series of “UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN.” I have put out a challenge to anyone interested in this subject: name any location, such as your hometown, and I bet I can find a UFO encounter there. Hundreds of people responded. I am working my way down the list of locations. In this episode I investigate eight places: Fort Wayne, IN----Greenock, Scotland----Warsaw, Poland----New Paltz, NY----St Charles, MO----Boston, MA----van horn, TX----Grand Junction, CO. And guess what, there are cases in each of these areas! Sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters…supported by eyewitness testimonies, photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects and more. Has your hometown been visited? The answer is probably YES!

FORT WAYNE, INDIANA. On February 7, 1955, American Airlines Flight 266 had a dramatic encounter with five UFO. In 1955, the Freeman family of Fort Wayne all watched a classic flying saucer. In 1967, minister Allen Federspiel reported his amazing sighting to NICAP. That same year, dozens of people saw a UFO hovering over Fort Wayne for four hours. In 1979, Sally Collet saw a UFO with a humanoid inside it right outside her home, and she wasn’t the only one. In 1991, a lady in Fort Wayne was chased by a UFO for 25 minutes. In 2005, another witness had a dramatic missing time encounter. The cases continue!

GREENOCK, SCOTLAND. Sightings, UFO fleets, humanoids, UFO photos…Greenock has them all. Back in 1948, two schoolgirls saw multiple UFOs hover overhead. One hovered so low, they could see a humanoid figure inside. They waved at it, and it waved back! Truly dramatic low-level sightings occurred in 1973, 1978 and 1999, including a case involving a fleet of UFOs. In 2005, Jonathan Smith heard shouting in the street and looking out his window, saw a group of colorful objects. He grabbed his camera and snapped an amazing photograph. These are just a few of the many cases in Greenock.

WARSAW, POLAND. Warsaw has an astonishing number of close encounter cases. In 1922, a Warsaw family observed a silver craft hover 400 feet away, so close, they thought they were about to be taken onboard. In 1959, an engineer observed a craft hovering over the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science. In 1975, a man was in the forests outside of Warsaw when he saw two gray-type ETs who rendered him temporarily paralyzed. In 1979, a man came so close to a landed craft, it burned his face. In 1986, a plumber was taken onboard a craft where he saw froglike beings. So many other cases!

NEW PALTZ, NEW YORK. Per whistleblower Robert S. Carr, a UFO landed in New Paltz, and a humanoid was captured by a game warden, and was taken alive to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia until it died. This is one of many New Paltz cases. In 1970, a woman and her boyfriend had a dramatic missing time encounter. Another dramatic case occurred in 1978 when three separate groups of witnesses observed a strange triangular craft over the city.

ST CHARLES, MISSOURI. One morning in 1971, three people, including a doctor, observed a low-level cone-shaped craft with a humanoid inside it. In 1973, the police received a call from a UFO witness. They sent out an officer, and he saw it himself. Soon many other witnesses saw it. In 1998, a witness described his sighting of a cigar-shaped craft with portholes on it.

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. Sightings here reach back to 1638, when a group of witnesses saw a UFO for three hours. In 1950, a dramatic UFO display involving multiple craft occurred over Logan International Airport. In 1955, a man reported his sighting of a craft as big as a 10-story building. In May 1963, a group of witnesses witnessed a fleet of UFOs over a drive-in theater. In 2024, a boyfriend and a girlfriend were stunned when a UFO shined a beam of light on their car, causing it to noticeably shake.

VAN HORN, TEXAS. This small town had an undeniable encounter with a classic flying saucer when, on July 23, 1999, truckers driving along Interstate 10 observed a craft with blue and white lights zigzagging at low level alongside the highway.

GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO. In 1956, four people were shocked by the appearance of metallic discs flying only 1500 feet overhead. In 1968, a man driving near Grand Junction saw a UFO that was so bright, it hurt his eyes to look at it. In 1969, two young men were walking down Main Street when a silver saucer with windows hovered for two minutes in view of hundreds of people. In 1985, Bob White was driving outside of Grand Junction when a UFO ejected a piece of metal right in front of him. He scooped it up, and had it studied by metallurgists who were unable to account for its composition. These are just a few of the many fascinating cases in Grand Junction.

It appears that every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. The evidence speaks for itself. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

An onboard UFO encounter is the most extensive of all UFO cases, and there are a lot of them. According to the Roper Polling organization, as many as one in fifty people show the markers of being UFO contactees. An onboard experience is far more common than most people know, and the fact is, most people remain silent about their encounters. This video presents six incredible accounts from across the world of people who have been onboard an extraterrestrial craft. These cases are not only fascinating, they have a lot to teach us about the ET agenda.

CONTACT IN CALGARY. At 5:45 pm on November 16, 1967, fourteen-year-old David Seewaldt was walking to his home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It should have been a three-minute walk. But suddenly a craft covered with colored lights appeared overhead and struck him with a beam of light. Running home, he realized he was missing forty minutes of time. Then, six months later, he had a dream where he remembered what happened during the missing time: he was taken onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled all the details, including being pulled onboard and being examined by reptilian-like entities.

CONTACT IN LOXLEY. On October 17, 1973, Clarence Ray Patterson (a 31-year-old electrician) was driving his pickup truck eastbound on Highway 10 near Loxley, Alabama when a cigar-shaped craft appeared overhead. It sent down a beam of light and pulled Clarence and his truck onboard. Inside the craft, Clarence was confronted by six robotic-like entities who pulled him from the truck and proceeded to examine him. Twenty minutes later, Clarence and his truck were set down 29 miles away, now in Florida. Unknown to Clarence, scores of people across the southwest saw UFOs and humanoids on that same night.

CONTACT IN VENADO TUERTO. At 6:45 am on September 6, 1978, twelve-year-old Juan Oscar Perez exited his ranch-house in Venado Tuerto, Argentina to round up the family’s horses. Suddenly a UFO appeared overhead, spooking the horses. Juan fled home in fear, but his father made him return to the area to collect the horses. Going to the horse pasture, Juan came upon a landed craft. A door opened and out stepped a tall robotic figure who invited Juan onboard the craft. Juan accepted the invitation and saw strange instruments and panels and another short robotic figure. As Juan left, he asked for an artifact to prove his encounter. The ET gave him a glove, but as he fled, they took the glove back. Both before and after Juan’s encounter, others in the area also had encounters with UFOs and humanoids.

CONTACT IN SOMMERECOURT. On July 8, 1983, Stefan Gasparovic and his family went camping in the hills near their home in Sommerecourt, Haute-Marne, France. That night, a brilliant object appeared overhead, coming back three times. The next night it appeared again, frightening the family. But on July 10, Stefan returned alone for a closer look. To his shock, the UFO appeared and dropped down right over his head. He found himself being pulled onboard. The next thing he knew, he was being dropped out of the craft several kilometers away, with vague memories of being examined by short, ugly humanoids. He was so traumatized, he couldn’t recall his own name and had to be hospitalized. Later, landing traces were found in the field where he was taken.

CONTACT IN GOODLAND. On the evening of November 7, 1989, friends Susan and Jennifer were driving between Flagler, Colorado and Goodland, Kansas when a UFO began to pace their car down the highway. At one point, it came close to their car and shone down a beam of light. The women kept driving and arrived at a motel in Goodland. That’s when they realized that a 72-mile trip had somehow taken three hours. Realizing they had missing time, they went under hypnosis, and both independently recalled being pulled from their car and taken onboard the craft, where they were separated and physical examined by gray ETs. Both held conversations with the ETs and learned the reasons behind their encounter.

CONTACT IN DEBRECEN. Late one evening in December 1990, teacher and artist Gabor Molnar was driving along Highway 35 near Debrecen, Hungary when his engine mysteriously quit and his car stopped. Suddenly he saw a “little green being” facing him from the roadside. The next thing he knew, he found himself inside a craft being examined by these beings with large black eyes. He blacked out and woke up back on the road with his car facing the wrong direction. His life would never be the same.

These six cases show what it’s like to be taken onboard a craft and examined by ETs. They provide some answers as to what happens inside a UFO, and why people are being taken onboard. They show how profoundly an encounter can affect a person in many ways. And most importantly, they add to our knowledge of this subject and provide further evidence that we are not alone in this universe.

Seeing a UFO is an incredible experience. But far more shocking is having a very close encounter with a humanoid extraterrestrial. When someone has very close face-to-face contact, there is no chance of misperception. It is an undeniable experience that instantly changes a person’s worldview. This video presents ten shocking cases of people who have had direct contact with UFO occupants. The cases span from 1923 to 2012, come from across the planet, and involve a wide variety of humanoids. These cases are supported by multiple eyewitness testimonies, radar returns, photographs, landing traces and more.

UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS. One summer morning in June 1923, ten-year-old Norman Wilson Massie went outside his home in Mount Erie, Illinois to check on the family’s horses. To his shock, he came upon a landed UFO with five little blond men, each about four feet tall. They rushed back and forth, apparently repairing their craft. After five minutes, the craft flew away. Norman told his family, but nobody else for many years.

MANY SURPRISES AWAIT TERRESTRIALS. It was a summer morning in 1945 when nine-year-old I. Chebotaryov went fishing along the shores of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov, Russia. He was about to return home when a silver craft dropped from the sky and landed in the water just off shore. A silver-suited humanoid exited and approached the witness, saying that he came from another planet, and invited the witness to come onboard.

HUMANOIDS VISIT A NAVY SHIP. In 1952, the USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt aircraft carrier had the first of what would be ten separate visitations by UFOs. This first encounter involved a metallic disk, as did a second and third encounter in 1956. In 1958, Navy officer Chester Grusinski was on deck when another craft appeared, and through the portholes he and many others saw alien figures looking down at them. The event was covered up as were the previous and future encounters.

THE DOCTOR AND THE ALIEN. On August 26, 1966, Dr. Juan Jose Rivera was driving his motorbike near Punta Carnero, Spain when he saw a monkey-like figure wearing a jumpsuit float across the road ahead of him. He chased it down a hill to a landed flying saucer. He snapped one quick photograph before fleeing the scene in panic.

THE HUMANOIDS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW. At 10pm on January 29, 1967, Enid Campbell looked out the window of her home in Knox City, Missouri to see a white spherical-shaped object approach her home and hover in her backyard. Looking inside, she saw two beings wearing “shiny silvery wetsuits.” She alerted her two children who also saw the craft. Afterward, they found burned vegetation in the backyard.

UFO AND HUMANOIDS LAND BY A TRAIN. On April 20, 1967, several railway employees riding past the Casalegno Station in Argentina were shocked to see a strange craft with multicolored lights and tiny three-foot-tall humanoid alongside the railroad tracks. They slowed down the train and watched in shock as these beings moved hastily around the craft. They discovered that an earlier train had also seen the UFO.

WE DID NOT LOOK BACK. At 3am on September 30, 1968, two young men were walking along a rural road near Roncenay, France when a glowing red UFO flew across the sky ahead of them. Coming around a corner, they saw that the craft had landed and two little humanoids were floating around it, shining flashlights on the ground. Then one of the humanoids approached to within 15 feet. The men fled in fear.

ROCK COLLECTING ALIENS. Around dusk one evening in 1976, nine-year-old Hercilio da Costa was walking to her home in rural San Goncalo do Amarante, Brazil when she walked right up to a landed UFO. Seven human-looking figures in dark jumpsuits stood around it. One was collecting small stones and putting them in a sac. When one of the beings spoke, Hercilio fled in fear. Later, landing traces were found.

THE FLOATING HUMANOID. At 1:30 am on December 30, 1979, Sebastiano Pannitteri woke up in his home in Sicily, Italy to his dog barking and his bedroom filling with light. Rushing to the window, he was awestruck to see a short humanoid dressed in a skin-tight white jumpsuit, floating in his yard. It remained there for five minutes before gliding away and disappearing behind a wall.

TWO ALIENS ABOVE SECOND STREET. On the night of May 25, 2012, six people in two cars were traveling west on Highway 7 in Clinton, Missouri when their journey was interrupted by an unusual sight: a large craft with glowing portholes was hovering just above 2nd Street. The witnesses were frightened to see two skinny humanoids looking out the window. More sightings soon followed.

So many cases of humanoid encounters! These ten cases may be shocking, but they are just the tip of the iceberg. These kinds of events are much more common than most people know. And they have lots to tell us about what’s out there beyond Earth. Are we ready to learn?

Despite what skeptics may claim, or any denials from our own govts, the thousands of firsthand cases of close encounters with humanoids speak for themselves: we are being visited by extraterrestrials. These visitors to Earth have been coming for a very long time. This video presents ten incredible humanoid encounters from many locations including France, Italy, Poland, Spain, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States. Evidence such as landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and radar returns prove that these visitors to Earth are very real indeed.

THE ALIEN IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT. At 6:35 am on April 3, 1948, driver Giuseppe Lanciano waited for the arrival of a train at San Martino, Italy. Suddenly his attention was drawn to a disc-shaped object, glowing orange, which zoomed silently overhead. He was joined by another witness and both watched as a beam came out of the bottom, carrying a short robotic-looking humanoid.

WENDY AND THE ALIENS. Early one morning in June of 1949, Wanda M’s father came running into their home in Dunino, Poland shouting that a strange craft had landed in their yard. He, their neighbors, and Wanda ran outside to see two humanoids in jumpsuits standing next to a large silver-brown, cone-shaped object. The beings spoke a strange language, gestured, and then returned to their craft. It took off, leaving behind landing traces.

ALMOST ABDUCTED. On the night of February 5, 1967, Timothy J. (age 15) was drawn outside his home in Hilliard, Ohio by a weird sound, and the barking of his dog. He was shocked to see a 75-foot-long craft fly by and land in a field. He watched as several figures came out and placed small spheres on the ground. Then Timothy stepped on a twig and the men heard him, came running and tried to pull him onto the craft.

A UFO IN THE BACKYARD. At 8:15 pm on July 20, 1967, Elizabeth Douglas stepped outside her home in Titusville, Florida and saw a 60-foot wide, bell-shaped craft floating silently overhead. Looking through one of the windows, she saw the silhouette of a large-headed, skinny figure looking down at her. She called out her daughter who also saw it. Inside, her son Steven wondered why his TV suddenly malfunctioned.

I KNOW WHAT I SAW. One morning in the summer of 1972, “Patricia,” (age 13,) was sitting in the backseat of the family car as they drove south of Molong, Australia when she saw a saucer-shaped craft sitting alongside the highway. Three 7-foot-tall silver-suited humanoids stood next to it, collecting samples. One looked directly at her as their car drove by.

THE ALIEN AND THE SNOWMOBILER. On the evening of February 26, 1973, Helene R, her brothers and friends were finishing up a day of snowmobiling in the McWatters area of Quebec, Canada, when a brilliant object zoomed overhead. While the others raced off, Helene was left alone. The strange craft returned and apparently landed. Helene then had a very scary encounter with a short humanoid.

THE GIANT HUMANOID. On the night of July 1, 1979, four teenage boys went hunting in the mountains near their homes in Sangonera La Verde, Spain. Suddenly a UFO blocked their way. They watched it for an hour when suddenly a 7-8 foot-tall humanoid wearing shiny tight-fitting clothes began to approach. The boys zoomed away in fear. They returned to town as they and others watched the UFO dart away.

“I AM CERTAIN THAT I SAW AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT.” On the night of January 4, 1994, the Noel family of Evreux, France reported their encounter with a black, triangular object. A few hours later, Didier Maury of Bacqueville had a scary encounter with a glowing cone-shaped object and an apparent humanoid. Hours after that, the Lopez family watched a UFO land next to their home and humanoids come out of it. These are only a few of an amazing series of events that occurred on that night and afterward.

THE ET IN THE PALM PLANTATION. One evening in April 2008, a man saw a UFO drop from the sky and into the Palm tree plantation near his home in Bankinang, Indonesia. Hopping on his motorbike to investigate, he was shocked to come upon a 6-foot-tall humanoid with a bald head, pointed ears, a skinny body and long arms dressed only in underwear and standing a short distance away. It quickly vanished.

THE MAGNETIC MAN. On the night of May 21, 2008, Walter Lopez and Omar Ferlatti were in a field near San Carlos, Salta, Argentina when they saw a tiny two-foot-tall humanoid figure wearing strange clothes standing nearby. They tried to get closer but were repelled by some kind of magnetic field. It turned out another person also saw the humanoid, and numerous people in the area were reporting UFOs.

Ten humanoid encounters, each adding to the catalog of thousands of similar cases, each providing more evidence that our planet is being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrial humanoids.

Has every location on our planet been visited by UFOs? The answer appears to be a resounding: yes! I put out a challenge to anyone interested in this subject: name a town or city anywhere on this planet, and I will find a UFO case there. Hundreds of people have responded, and so far, every place I have investigated has a history of UFOs and extraterrestrials. In Part Three of this series, “UFOs in Your Hometown,” we continue the search for UFOs across planet Earth, covering nine different locations, including Ealing, London (UK,); Frankfort, IN; Warrenton, MO; Santa Clarita, CA; Milwaukee, WI; Roseville, CA; Show Low, AZ; Littleton, MA and Bastrop, TX. These cases include the full range of UFO activity: sighting, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters, even a possible UFO crash.

EALING, LONDON, UK. Way back in 1845, numerous people reported seeing a humanoid wearing skintight overalls and a transparent helmet leaping over walls far faster than a human. There’s also the 1978 sighting of a classic flying saucer that the witness felt was meant for him to see. Or the gentleman who saw a boomerang-shaped craft during a lunar eclipse in 2015. And more!

FRANKFORT, INDIANA. Starting in 1953, Frankfort has been the location of constant UFO activity. Sightings continued throughout the 1950s, culminating in a fantastic encounter in 1958 when four UFOs played hide-and-seek with a diesel train for over an hour. In 1977, four people reported a scary encounter where they were followed by a UFO. In 1981, numerous people throughout Frankfort, including police, had amazing encounters, showing once again that UFOs are very interested in Frankfort.

WARRENTON, MISSOURI. An incredible 1969 encounter by a technical illustrator in Warrenton, MO is only one of several amazing cases. Another case involved a couple who had a very close encounter with a craft that hovered right above a highway overpass. In 2019, a couple were shocked to see a UFO cloaked inside a cloud come right over their home. They may have also seen humanoids!

SANTA CLARITA, CALIFORNIA. This town outside of Los Angeles, CA has some very dramatic cases. On July 13, 1979, Ed and Gloria Towers were shocked to see a metallic saucer target their home, hovering only 50 feet overhead. A very similar case happened to another Santa Clarita family in 2015 when a giant boomerang-shaped craft went right over their house. And more!

MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN. Sightings in this city reach back to 1896 with the famous airship wave. Throughout 1952, numerous city officials reported very dramatic sightings of solid craft darting around in the sky in some cases for hours at a time. More dramatic sightings occurred throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1980, an attorney reports that he was taken onboard a craft and met human-looking ETs. Sightings continued up to the present day, including a case of a UFO photograph in 2022.

ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA. Several amazing multiple-witness sightings of disc-shaped craft have occurred in this town. There’s also the case of a lady who was taken onboard a craft in 2004. In 2016, a highway patrol officer reported a dramatic encounter with a low-flying triangle. In 2022, a woman was puzzled by two objects hovering outside her home and managed to take two photos!

SHOW LOW, ARIZONA. In the summer of 1988, a woman woke up in her hotel room to see two unusual-looking ETs come through the wall, stand at the foot of her bed, and communicate telepathically with her. Just north of Show Low in the small town of Concho, a woman and her friends saw a UFO drop from the sky. They drove to the location, and came upon what appeared to be the craft stuck in a ravine.

LITTLETON, MASSACHUSETTS. Amazing sightings occurred here, including a 1954 low-level sighting of a Saturn-shaped object, a multi-witness sighting of a classic saucer in 1964, a sighting by two men of an object over a highway involving the strange “Oz Factor,” and a 2015 sighting directly over the local police station.

BASTROP/BERGSTROM AFB, TEXAS. In 1947 two Air Force officers at Bergstrom saw a silver saucer flying at 1,400 mph, overtaking their plane. In 1965, two Bergstrom officer with Top Secret clearances saw a craft with portholes right over the base. They told nobody. In 1980, a newsman and his wife had a dramatic sighting right outside Bastrop. In 1988, a UFO came so close to a Bastrop man that he shot at it with his gun. More dramatic cases continued in 2013 and 2014.

These are just some of the many amazing encounters that have occurred in these nine locations. Firsthand cases reaching back a hundred years up to the present day, multiple witnesses, a wide variety of evidence to support them: the truth can no longer be denied. The cases speak for themselves. We are not alone. Our planet is being visited; apparently every location on our planet! Including your own hometown!

Few experiences are as astounding as a direct face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid from another world. And yet, the number of cases is far greater than most people think. They have been reported for well over a hundred years and probably into antiquity. Cases come from all over the world. This video presents ten little known cases, each one adding to our knowledge of ET contact. There are far too many cases to be explained away as hoaxes, hallucinations, or misperceptions.

THE ETS AND THE SAUCER. On the afternoon of May 5, 1954, eight-year-old Arnaldo Ribeiro de Freitas was goat-herding near his home in Fregim, Portugal when an odd sound alerted him to two UFOs hovering nearby. One flew off, but the other remained, and Arnaldo could see two big-headed humanoids sitting inside it. And one was looking right at him! After it departed, it left weird landing traces on the ground.

ANOTHER ALIEN MICHELIN MAN. One afternoon in May of 1960, Professor Miguel Timermans Ceballos was driving his motorcycle near Cadiz, Spain. Looking ahead, he saw a strange humanoid figure which looked very much like the famous Michelin Man. Seconds later, a second figure appeared. Both walked clumsily across the road before disappearing into the brush. Miguel was convinced they were not human.

IT WASN’T ANYTHING HUMAN. Late in the evening of October 23, 1963, Robert W. Smith drove in a rural area of South River, NJ when he saw something odd in the beams of his car headlights: three very short humanoid figures dressed in tight-fitting, silver, one-piece suits. They darted across the road far faster than a human could move. Robert was too frightened to stop. It was an experience he would never forget.

THE FLOATING HUMANOID OF COFICO. On July 2, 1968, numerous residents of Cofico, Argentina observed UFOs and/or humanoids hovering overhead. Three witnesses at one home described a glowing humanoid figure floating in the air. Another witness described a 9-foot-tall robotic figure, also floating in the sky. Another witness in a different home described the same thing. Even policemen witnessed strange activity.

THE JAY-WALKING ALIENS. In early May of 1969, numerous residents in Rockville, Virginia started seeing UFOs darting around overhead. But on the night of May 11, 1969, Mike Luczkowich saw actual humanoids. Driving along Route 622, he saw what he first thought were two deer. Instead, he realized they were four-foot-tall humanoids with giant heads. They crossed the road in front of him, followed by a third one.

THE DUMBBELL ETS. On the night of October 24, 1976, Romeo Lucarelli and his young daughter were driving to their home in Hobling, France when a brilliant light appeared ahead of them. It zoomed towards them and revealed itself to be a dumbbell-shaped object with two humanoid figures inside. To Romeo’s fear, the craft followed them home. His wife ran out just in time to see the UFO dart away.

<p><b>IT DIDN’T SEEM LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.</b> On the night of January 21, 1977, Juan Pedro Hernandez of Camuy, Puerto Rico was shocked to see an ET craft hovering at low altitude overhead. Inside he saw a skinny figure with a big head and dark eyes looking at him. Suddenly he was struck a beam of light from the UFO. The beam retracted and the UFO departed. Juan followed, but govt agents appeared, blocking his way.</p>

THE UFO GNOME. In late March of 1978, Constantina Imbibos and her husband began seeing UFOs behind their home in Villamare Di Sapri, Italy. After several sightings, on April 25,1978, Constantina saw another UFO, and seconds later, a strange gnome-like humanoid wearing an orange suit and pointed hat. It bounced around like a gnome. Soon more UFOs would be seen, and more gnome-like entities.
 
AN 8-FOOT-TALL GRAY. On the night of July 31, 2018, a military veteran with a Top Secret clearance was driving on State Route 13 just north of Mount Vernon, Ohio when an eight-foot-tall, incredibly thin, hairless humanoid crossed the road in front of him. It had black eyes, a small mouth and four fingers on each hand. It was not human. Truly frightened, the witness decided not to stop.

I SAW SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET. Around 5am on July 16, 2020, Paul Froggatt was bicycling home from work in Warwick, UK when a UFO appeared. He snapped two photos with his camera, but became frightened when the craft seemed to follow him. Moments later he came face-to-face with a 7-foot-tall, praying mantis humanoid. He was so frightened he began to cry. He fled the area, thoroughly traumatized.

As hard as it might be for some people to believe, the growing number of cases involving humanoid encounters make it undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials. Thankfully, as the government UFO coverup collapses, and as more people reveal their encounters, the truth is coming out. ETs are real! And it’s time that all of humanity knows it.

A close encounter with a UFO, and especially humanoids, challenges a person on multiple levels: physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Almost without exception witnesses are left stunned, surprised, bewildered. The ten cases presented in this video come from across the world and involve a wide variety of humanoids. They contain a wide variety of evidence. And each case shows how the witnesses are deeply and profoundly affected to a degree that their lives are never the same.

BLACK HOLE ALIENS. On August 26,1974, Jean Marie Bigorne stepped outside his home in Feignies, France and saw a black hole in the gray night sky. As it started to descend, he rushed inside, got his wife, and together they watched it split into two half-circles. The right side disappeared, but the left side suddenly revealed two robotic-looking humanoids. The witnesses became entranced and watched it for 45 minutes until going inside. They never saw it leave.

ALIENS IN THE ANDES. On the evening of February 17, 1981, cattleman Jose Fermin Albornoz was sleeping after protecting a herd of sheep in the Manzano-Amargo area of the Argentinian Andes. A brilliant light and buzzing noise woke him up and he saw a saucer land next to his campsite. As the animals scattered, two strange humanoids appeared and spoke to him in a strange language. Jose fainted in fear.

HUMANOIDS AT THE CAMPGROUND. On evening in 1981, a group of people were camping at Laguna Sofia National Park in Puerto Natales, Chile. One of the campers stepped outside her tent and saw a strange craft drop from the sky and land nearby. As she approached, a door opened and three tall humanoids exited and began taking soil samples. She fled and woke everyone up in time to watch the craft dart away.

THE LIGHT-HEADED ALIEN. On the night of October 9, 1984, doorman Isidoro Ferri was woken up in his bedroom at the Villa La Radicchia in Polcanto, Italy by a brilliant light streaming in through the window. Paralyzed, he saw that the light was coming from the head of a humanoid standing outside. Shortly later, he saw a craft. The light flashed and fluctuated, causing alarming physiological effects. Afterwards, landing traces were found, and researchers found many other witnesses.

THE ALIENS AT SCHOOL. One day in June 1986, “Leif” was parked next to a school in Ytteroya, Norway when he noticed a three-foot-tall figure with a bald head and huge dark eyes approach. It wore a shiny blue jumpsuit. Fifteen feet behind it was a landed UFO. Leif hid behind the truck as the being turned around and re-entered the craft. Two of the figures turned and stared at Leif as the craft rose into the sky and departed.

THE HUNTERS AND THE ALIENS. On the night of June 26, 1987, three men were hunting in the countryside near Badajoz, Spain when a brilliant light appeared in the sky. It zoomed towards them and landed, disgorging two tall, strong-looking figures. The two humanoids approached the hunters, who panicked and fled the scene. Moments later, they saw the craft depart. Later, landing traces were found.

KT & THE GRAYS. One day in May 1992, wildlife researcher K.T. Frankovich was walking her dogs through a lime grove next to her apartment in Miami-Dade, Florida. Suddenly a gray alien appeared. K.T. watched it for several minutes, receiving several telepathic messages before fleeing the scene. A few nights later, two grays appeared outside her apartment with another profound message.

HAVANA HUMANOID. On the morning of November 27, 1995, security guard Samuel Rodolfo Barreras was shocked to see a flying saucer approach and land next to the buildings he was guarding outside of Havana City, Cuba. A door in the craft opened and out stepped a robotic-looking humanoid who approached Samuel (who was now paralyzed.) The being scanned the area for 15 minutes before returning to the craft, which promptly departed.

THE HUMANOID IN THE BATHROOM. Late on the night of June 24, 2001, Mr. G.H. a university professor from Patras, Greece, walked into his kitchen and was confronted by a tall faceless humanoid wearing a shiny blue coverall. It ran into his bathroom and disappeared. For the next few minutes, he chased it around the house, back into the bathroom twice more until it was gone, leaving the witnesses utterly bewildered.

IT APPEARED THREE TIMES. One night in December 2001, a young man was watching TV alone in his family’s home in Tampa, Florida. Hearing an odd crinkling sound outside, he looked and saw a gray ET standing in his backyard. It quickly disappeared. Later, the witness heard the same sound again and saw that the ET had returned to his backyard. Then the gray-skinned humanoid returned a third time.

These ten cases show how incredibly strange a UFO/humanoid encounter can be, and how profoundly it changes a person. Nobody but a firsthand witness can ever know what it’s truly like to have an encounter with a humanoid from a UFO.

Humanoid encounters are far more numerous than you might think. Cases come from across the world and have been occurring for a very long time. It can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime! These cases make it clear that we still have much to learn about the Universe we live in. This video presents ten cases of people who have had face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials of many different kinds.

THE LITTLE MAN IN THE UFO. One night in December 1951, the Coley family of Red Springs, NC were amazed to see a UFO hovering near their home. More amazing, they could see a humanoid figure inside. This was just the beginning. On August 6, 1952, James J. Allen saw a craft land next to his home in nearby Lumberton. A short humanoid figure emerged, quickly returned into the craft which took off. In 1975 a huge wave of sightings occurred, and was observed by dozens of police officers. Along with it came several more humanoid encounters.

THE LITTLE BLACK ALIENS. On the afternoon of October 9, 1957, Marie Yeager sat in her home in Mariaville, NY when a UFO landed in the forest near her home. Moments later, it departed. But the next day it was back, and this time she saw little black humanoids come out of it. She fled her home in fear. But soon she discovered that other people in her area had also seen UFOs.

FIVE SAUCERS AND SIX ALIENS. On the morning of November 18, 1957, tobacco farmers Pedro Zilli and Joao Ermani of Maracaja, Brazil were amazed to see two silver craft landed in the fields next to their farm. As they approached, they saw six tall humanoids dressed in skintight jumpsuits running inside the craft, which promptly took off. Unknown to them, many other people in the area were also seeing UFOs.

SOMETHING WEIRD OVER DENMARK. On November 21, 1957, grocer Hans Haugaard Hansen was driving near Gesten, Denmark when he noticed a strange craft hovering over a nearby turnip field. He stopped his car and was amazed to see two human-looking figures inside a transparent cockpit. The craft quickly took off. He called the police who investigated and learned that other people in the area were also seeing UFOs and humanoids. In fact, these events took place during a huge wave across the entire country which caused concern at the highest levels of government.

I CAN STILL FEAL THE FEAR. One afternoon in June of 1963, an anonymous woman and her 7-year-old son were vacationing on the small island of Storholmen in Sweden. As they stood by the shore, a strange feeling overcame her, and looking out, she saw a silver craft approach. Inside and on top of it, she saw two perfect-looking muscular men dressed in tight jumpsuits. The craft approached so close that she and her son hid in fear. Then it sped away so fast it disappeared from view in seconds. 

ALIEN STREET SWEEPER. On the evening of November 18, 1973, four ladies were driving outside Montreal, Canada, when a UFO began to pace their car. After several miles of being followed, they drove through a weird “pink cloud.” Moments later, they saw a short humanoid figure standing in the middle of the road. Unknown to them, many people in the area were seeing UFOs on the same night.

“DON’T YOU WANT TO COME ONBOARD?” It was a Summer morning in 1974 as “Mrs. N.” took a walk near her home in Oslo, Norway. Suddenly beautiful music began to play, a glowing craft approached and began to follow her. Inside she saw three figures in dark jumpsuits. One of them stood up, smiled, and gestured to her. She had the impression it was inviting her to come onboard. Filled with fear, Mrs. N ran, and the craft followed.

LANDING AT A FRENCH FARM. At 6:30 pm on December 9, 1977, Chanta L of Fonforet, France was amazed to see a glowing craft land outside her farmhouse. Moments later, a 7-foot-tall being floated out of the craft and explored around before returning inside it. Later the craft took off and landed again, leaving strange traces on the ground. At this time, many people in the area were reporting UFOs.

I HEARD A PIERCING SCREAM. One night in March 1978, rancher Monte Brinsmead saw a classic flying saucer with colored lights outside his farm near Lake Sorell, Tasmania. He grabbed his rifle to shoot at it when it took off. He learned that many of his neighbors had been seeing UFOs. Soon numerous events of high strangeness occurred, including an encounter with an apparent humanoid.

THE ALIEN AT THE BEACH. At 9am on February 3, 1994, six witnesses at the beach in Ancona, Passetto, Italy saw a weird humanoid figure wandering among the rock formation known as “Pope’s Chair” along the beach. Suddenly it flew up into the air and off into the distance.

These ten cases show that a UFO and humanoid encounter can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. While there are those who remain skeptical, there are too many cases to deny, dismiss or debunk. The accounts speak for themselves. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

Ask and ye shall receive! I recently put out a challenge on my YouTube channel, name any location on Earth, such as your hometown, and I bet I can find a UFO encounter that occurred there! I received more than 150 responses. Challenge accepted! And guess what? I was right! So far, I have been successful in locating UFO cases in every location provided. UFOs are seen everywhere. Pick a location and the chances are it has a long history of UFO encounters. This video is Episode Two of an ongoing series I call “UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN.” For this episode, by special request from you, the viewers, I cover the locations: Locust Grove, Oklahoma; McMinnville, Oregon; India (yes, the country!); Berkshire Mountains, Massachusetts; Sacramento, California and Nova Scotia, Canada. The encounters in these locations include sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard encounters. The evidence supporting these cases includes multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs, radar-returns, landing traces, animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Have UFOs visited your hometown? Likely, the answer is yes!

LOCUST GROVE, OKLAHOMA. This is a very small rural town with a population of less than 1400 people, and yet, there is a UFO case involving multiple sightings of strange orbs along with strange animal reactions.

MCMINNVILLE, OREGON. On May 11, 1950, the town of McMinnville earned international headlines when Paul and Evelyn Trent captured two photographs of a metallic saucer hovering over their farmhouse. Today, the photos are considered among the best on record. But McMinnville has many other cases. In 1957, the Kelchner family viewed a glowing egg-shaped object over their poultry farm for 30 minutes. In 1976, a man called the National UFO reporting Service (NUFORC) to report his sighting of a UFO being chased by jet fighters. In 1991, Susan Wold called the newspapers about her sighting of a solid object in view for 45 minutes. There are more incredible sightings, including a report of a strange humanoid seen by campers at an isolated McMinnville Ranch.

INDIA. With a population well in excess of one billion people, India has countless UFO cases. For this reason, only humanoid cases are presented. In March of 1931, a 14-year-old boy from the Andhra Pradesh area of India says he met a wise old Sage who took him onboard a craft where he was given predictions of future disasters. Other cases include a 1954 landing with humanoids near a beryllium mine; a 1976 encounter between a woman and an eight-foot-tall humanoid; a family’s multiple encounters with a UFO and entities with the appearance of Hindu Gods, and more. In 1985, a girl from Bihar was taken onboard and examined by ETs. In 2001, a group of boys from Ahmedabad reported their encounter with two short pale beings. One amazing account includes a UFO and humanoid encounter by a group of scientists in the Indian Himalayas, involving an actual photograph of the humanoid. And many other cases.

BERKSHIRE MOUNTAINS, MASSACHUSETTS. This area in the western part of the state contains many cities, so in this episode I cover a few famous accounts, including the alleged onboard experience of talk show host, Morton Downey Jr. Another very famous case is that of Thom Reed, who in 1967 along with his family, had a very close encounter. Other sightings occurred in 1973, 1978 and more.

SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA. This city contains more than a half million residents, and has a long and rich history of sightings, landings, and humanoids. The earliest occurred in 1896 with the famous airship wave. Classic saucer sightings were made in 1947, 1950, 1952, 1955, 1957 and more. One of the strangest UFO cases on record occurred to a paperboy on July 11, 1961 that must be heard to be believed. A truly astonishing case involves a witness who saw a landed UFO and humanoids near McClellan AFB. Encounters continue, with some as recent as 2018.

NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA. This area contains many towns and cities and a huge variety of encounters. In 1952, the crew of the Marcala reported their close encounter with a silvery UFO. In 1952, a trained weather observer had an amazing encounter with a disc. An amazing humanoid encounter occurred in 1953. A harrowing USO encounter occurred in May 1963. Nova Scotia’s most famous case by far is the Shag Harbor incident of October 4, 1967. More landings, USOs, pilot encounters and more, including an incredible encounter of a UFO over a graveyard.

Six specific locations – all with a history of UFO encounters. As should be obvious by now, UFOs are seen everywhere: sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard experiences and more. Pretty much every location on this planet has a long history of encounters. Those who don’t think UFOs are real have not done their research. It’s that simple. The evidence is undeniable. We are not alone!

When it comes to extraterrestrials, the humanoid form seems to be the universal template. The vast majority of reports involve some kind of bipedal humanoid. And there are sooo many! These accounts come from across the planet, and have been occurring for a very long time. The cases have astounding similarities that point towards the veracity of these accounts, and they are also supported by a wide variety of evidence. This video presents ten cases of face-to-face encounters with humanoids. There are too many cases to ignore, deny or explain away. The evidence speaks for itself. There is life beyond Earth.

ET CONTACTS DEAF-MUTE MAN. One evening in 1950, 13-year-old William Ortiz (who was deaf) saw a gray-type ET outside his home in Floridablanca, Colombia. Moments later, he saw a landed craft and several other figures. The ET closest to him then communicated telepathically and used sign-language. Afterwards, William’s hearing was temporarily restored. It was to be the first of three amazing encounters.

THE LITTLE MAN OF NORBOTTEN. From 1970-1972, people over a wide area near Norbotten, Sweden encountered a strange little man that did not appear to be human. The little figure was often seen along highways late at night, and was usually accompanied by blinding lights and mysterious sounds. Some witnesses reported strange medical effects after their encounters.

ALIENS AT A RADIO STATION. In the Spring of 1975, a nightwatchman at the Maribor Radio station in Yugoslavia (now Slovenia) received a series of strange phone-calls at the station. Two months later, he was at work when TV malfunctioned. Then, in walked four tall humanoid figures. One approached the witness (now unable to move) and pressed his thumb against his neck. The high strangeness had just begun.

ALIEN OR ESCAPED CIRCUS DWARF? At 4pm on May 14, 1976, two men were shocked to see a short humanoid in the wilderness at Monte Parodi, Italy. It wore a strange jumpsuit and floated above the ground. Four months later, on September 17, 1976, 15 witnesses saw another short humanoid in the same area. This time, there were landing traces, radiation readings, and one of the witnesses photographed the ET.

A PURPLE-HAIRED ALIEN. On the morning of March 13, 1978, Claudio Franco (age 10) was at school in Vilar Formosa, Portugal. During class, he went alone to the restroom and as he exited, he was pushed down. Then he saw a shocking sight: a humanoid figure with purple hair, a wrinkled and scarred face, wearing a skintight white jumpsuit stared down at him. After 10 minutes, the figure disappeared. Claudio found burn-marks on his back.

WE LOVE YOU. On the evening of October 14, 1978, Peggy Otis and her young granddaughter Jenny were driving to their home in Bear Valley, Colorado when a UFO appeared over their car. Peggy recalls exiting the car, screaming, and seeing what she thought were angels. Later, she sought hypnosis, and recalled having a telepathic conversation with gray aliens who had important messages to share with her.

MY WORLD WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE THE SAME. One evening in August of 1979, Mrs. H.M. Dickinson was in her home overlooking Patten Bay in Surry, Maine when she and a friend saw a small bulb-shaped, transparent craft with a bald-headed creature inside floating a few feet away. The creature turned its head and stared at her as it floated off. A few days later, the being returned!

I NEVER BELIEVED IN ALIENS. Around dusk one evening in February 1981, an anonymous farmer from Westfield, North Carolina went to look for his dog who had run off. He found his dog attacking a small, thin, hairless humanoid with large dark eyes. The humanoid's legs were mangled by his dog. The farmer ran off in fear. When he returned the next day, the humanoid was gone, and his dog was dead.

WE COME FROM VERY FAR AWAY. On the night of February 6, 1991, Sylvia and two friends observed a UFO near Sylvia’s home in Chaville, France. Returning home, Sylvia was struck by a beam of light from the object. That night, strange humanoids visited her in her bedroom. The next morning, she received a telepathic message from the ETs and had a face-to-face encounter with an apparent gray alien.

THE ALIENS FOLLOWED THEM HOME. On the afternoon of December 19, 2015, two brothers (Miguel and Patricio) were hiking in the forests near their home in Auracania, Chile when two tall humanoids wearing white jumpsuits confronted them. The boys ran home and the humanoids chased them. Arriving home, they locked the doors. Their mother also saw the two humanoids, which remained outside for the next two hours. 

These ten cases contain many important insights into the nature of UFO contact. They show how similar ETs can be. They show how contact can be very frightening. They show how truly advanced extraterrestrials are. Most importantly, these cases provide compelling evidence for the reality of visitors from beyond Earth.

There are many different kinds of UFO encounters, but the ultimate experience is being taken onboard a craft and meeting ETs face-to-face. And it happens more often than you might think. In 1991, the Roper Poll Survey found that as many as 1 in 50 people may be UFO contactees, which means that millions of people are having this kind of encounter! This episode presents just a small sample of six cases from around the world. These cases involve both single and multiple witnesses and contain some very compelling evidence such as physiological effects, healings, implants and more. Even more importantly, they answer some of the many questions surrounding this subject.

THE CASE OF BETTY STEWART DAGENAIS. In 1925, when Betty Stewart Dagenais of Ontario Canada was only five years old, she was taken onboard a craft and examined by gray ETs. A few months later it happened again. As an adult she had three more encounters. These were primarily recalled under hypnosis, and all she could remember was being physically examined and apparently given an alien implant. This turned out to be true, because later her implant was surgically removed by doctors here on Earth, and it turned out to have some amazing properties that defy conventional explanations.

THE CASE OF SHARON KEEFE. Sharon’s first UFO sighting occurred when she was only 11 or 12 years old. Years later as an adult living in Gallup, NM, she started having missing time. In 1975-76, while driving with her daughters along the highway at night, she was followed by a UFO and experienced another episode of missing time. She decided to seek hypnosis, and recalled that she and her daughters were taken onboard a craft and examined by tall gray beings. They told her that they were there to test her endurance and give her gifts. She felt love and compassion for the beings and felt that her experience was benevolent.

THE CASE OF HERMINIO & BIANCA REIS. On the evening of January 12, 1976, while driving along a remote highway near Paraibuna, Brazil, Bianca Reis saw a glowing orange object in the sky. She alerted her husband, Herminio, and the next thing they knew, it sent down a beam of light onto their car and sucked them both (with their car) into the craft. Inside they met tall human-looking beings who spoke telepathically with them, engaging them in a long conversation about deep, philosophical subjects. They gave them information about how to teach people to advance their own psychic abilities and learn astral projection. Soon more contacts occurred and even more people became involved and even healed!

THE CASE OF GHULAM REZA BAZARANI. It was April 2, 1976, the day of “Sizdeh-Bedar,” an Iranian holiday when Gholam Reza Bazargani (age 19) went walking in the forests near his home in Chalus, Iran. Gholam was from a wealthy family, and when he went missing, police organized a massive search. Two days later, Gholam was found hundreds of miles to the south in the city of Isfahan. He had an amazing story to tell. He said that a silver flying saucer appeared overhead and he suddenly found himself inside it being examined by non-human entities. He recalled being examined by instruments with colored lights, and then lost consciousness. When he awoke, his watch was missing. On the day of his return, many people in the area saw flying saucers.

THE CASE OF MIGUEL HERRERO SIERRA. Early on the morning of December 18, 1977, Miguel Herrero Sierra (a 37-year-old driver/entrepreneur) left his home in Alcala, Spain to go fishing at the Buendia Reservoir. He never made it. Half-way there, his car engine mysteriously failed. Then he saw a landed flying saucer in the field next to him. Two human-looking figures dressed in white jumpsuits approached and pulled him onboard. The ETs told him that they were contacting many people on Earth and told him many other things before returning him back to his car. While Miguel remembered at least 15 minutes of being onboard, the entire experience lasted three hours. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled more incredible details.

THE CASE OF HELEN. On January 24, 1992, “Helen,” (age 50) was with her husband in their home in Mezobereny, Hungary. Suddenly a strange apparition of a woman appeared in her kitchen. Later that night, Helen felt compelled to go into her backyard where she saw a landed flying saucer. She went onboard where she saw many other women and young children. Over the next few nights, she had the same experience. Then she woke up in her bed to find several strange dark marks on her abdomen. Doctors were unable to diagnose or explain them. Then, to Helen’s surprise, she found herself cured of two chronic medical conditions!

These six cases are just a tiny portion of the actual number of cases of this kind, and yet they provide a representative sample of what it’s like to have the ultimate UFO encounter, an onboard experience and face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials.

Around 6:00 p.m., on November 6, 1957, John Trasco and his wife Ellen were in their home in Everittstown, New Jersey. John had just returned from his job at the local paper mill. He stepped out to feed their dog, King, a six-year-old, charcoal-colored, half-blind, bad-tempered, Belgian police dog, who they kept tied to the side of the house.

Shortly after John stepped outside, Mrs. Trasco heard King barking furiously. She looked outside and saw a strange reflection in the yard. Staring at it, she was amazed to see it was a glowing egg-shaped object, about nine to twelve feet long, hovering, and bobbing up and down. Meanwhile, John also saw the craft, and approaching him from the direction of the craft was a strange humanoid figure.

“I looked and I seen a little man,” John says. “…He came down towards me and he said, ‘Don’t be afraid. I don’t mean any harm.’ So, I got a little closer to him and started talking to him about the dog. And he said, ‘Don’t be afraid. We’re friendly people, we don’t mean any harm.’ I started shaking. I was scared. He came up to me and said, ‘Would you like to give us your dog, we’d like to have it.”

The man spoke very slowly in English, with what sounded like a German accent in a sharp, squeaky voice. “We just want your dog,” he said.

So began one of the strangest UFO encounters in history. In this episode, you can hear the firsthand audiotape interview with John and Ellen as they describe their unique and bizarre encounter with a short humanoid who tried to abduct their dog. This episode is a sequel or addendum to the episode, “ALIENS ABDUCTED BY DOG," which features more than two dozen cases of this kind. You can learn more about them in my book, "NOT FROM HERE: VOLUME FIVE," now available on Amazon.

We all love our fur babies, and dogs are the most popular pet of all. They have been man’s best friend for countless millennia. What many people don’t know, however, is that ETs also show a great interest in canines. There has never been a study of dog-UFO cases until now! This video presents more than two dozen cases in which dogs have been directly and extensively involved with UFOs and extraterrestrials. These cases reach back to the 1940s up to the present day, and they provide some profound insights into extraterrestrials and their agenda on this planet.

These cases come from across the planet, New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Ukraine, England, Wales, Ireland, Spain, Canada, Mexico, and more, including all over the United States. A wide variety of ETs show interest in a wide variety of dogs. The cases include dogs being taken onboard and examined, and even in some cases healed. In some cases, the dogs are taken by themselves. In others, people are taken onboard with their own dogs. 

Why are ETs taking dogs onboard? What do these accounts have to tell us about extraterrestrials? The answers are in this unique episode. These cases offer a wide variety of compelling evidence including multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs of UFOs, audio recordings from firsthand witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, and of course, animal reaction cases!

With so many encounters like these, the truth cannot be denied. ETs are showing an interest in dogs. If you would like to explore more about cases like these, check out the book, “Not from Here: Volume Five,” which contains a full-length chapter with a comprehensive presentation of dog-UFO encounters. Now available on Amazon!

UFOs are seen all over our planet. It appears that virtually every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. But is this true? Recently a put out a challenge: name a location that you would like to know if UFOs have visited such as your hometown. The response was huge: many people asked if I could find any UFO cases in their hometown. So, by special request, this episode presents ten locations from across the United States (and a few outside of it,) and the history of UFO encounters that have occurred there. This includes sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids and of course, onboard encounters. Compelling evidence supports many of these cases including multiple eyewitness testimonies, photographs, radar-returns, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more.

WENATCHEE, WASHINGTON. This history of UFOs in Wenatchee reaches back to at least 1907 when a strange airship was seen by multiple citizens. Following this, many other encounters occurred, including star-like objects, multi-colored UFOs, cone-shaped objects, shiny silver triangular-shaped objects, craft turning at right angles, and even a large object directly over downtown Wenatchee.

SIOUX FALLS, SD. One of the earlier Sioux Falls cases involved the sighting of a classic flying saucer moving overhead in July 1947. In 1954, police officers in Sioux Falls and surrounding areas saw UFOs. In 1957, police officer Jack Peters photographed a UFO as people all over the area witnessed strange activity. In 1976, UFOs were seen landing in Sioux Falls, and some reported seeing an actual ET. Even as late as 2018, UFOs continued to appear.

PAYSON, AZ. In July of 1969, a ranch family had a dramatic sighting of a classic flying saucer outside their ranch home. 1981, Sheriff Deputy Loyce Hamlin and 4 other officers reported UFOs. Hamlin had seen one before following a plane taking off from Payson. In the late 1980s, a Payson resident reported missing time while returning to his home. The sightings continued!

ALBANY, GA. In 1948, a pilot’s sighting over Albany was declared unidentified by Project Blue Book. More pilot sightings occurred in 1953 and in 1956. In 1968, Conway Jones reported a frightening encounter where a UFO disabled his car. In 1973, a flurry of encounters over Albany generated national headlines.

AALBORG, DENMARK. In 1963, a flying saucer landed next to a farmhouse in Aalborg. A human-looking ET came out and took the farmer onboard, right in front of his amazed wife. In 2006, 2009, and 2011, three more close encounters were reported, showing that Aalborg has been repeatedly visited by extraterrestrials.

VISALIA/TULARE, CA. In November of 1989, hundreds of residents in the area witnessed the now famous unexplained airships. Following this, encounters occurred regularly, including in 1952, 1979, and 2010. On January 1, 2022, a family had a close-up sighting of a UFO and captured three photos of the object hovering near their home.

PHILIPPINES. On March 8, 1968, more than 100 passengers on a jet over the Bashi Channel were amazed to see a UFO pacing their plane. A few months later, a mini-wave of sightings were observed by hundreds of people in the city of Manila. In November of 1968, four separate groups of witnesses observed a strange object with two human-looking figures inside. In 1979, a UFO was seen by many landing near Mount Apo. In 1991, a resident saw a UFO land near her home. ETs came out and started picking flowers.

ST LOUIS, MO. This city has many cases. A chiropractor reports his lifelong experiences with friendly ETs. In 1966, a UFO was seen landing at Point Pleasant Elementary school, and several students and one teacher saw an ET. Another case involves a dramatic sighting over a drive-in theater. And there are two other cases, one involving a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid, and another involving a landing.

OCALA, FL. Sightings here reach back to 1947 and occur regularly, including in 1952, 1955, 1957, 1968, 1974 and more. On May 14, 1978, a wave of sightings over Ocala was witnessed by dozens and was also seen and caught on radar at the Navy’s Pinecastle Electronic Warfare Range. The wave went on for months and generated national headlines and huge controversy. In April 2003, a woman reported a humanoid in her home which healed her of a problem pregnancy. The sightings continued.

WILMINGTON, NC. On April 6, 1897, hundreds in Wilmington saw the famous unexplained airships. More sightings of UFOs occurred in 1977 and 1980. In 1986, a couple had a scary encounter with a giant V-shaped craft. In 2001, a gentleman reported his terrifying encounter with humanoids in his Wilmington home.

These are just a small sample of the actual number of the documented cases coming from these ten locations. And these are just the ones which have been recorded. The fact is, most people don’t report their encounters. Have UFOs visited your hometown?

The time for skepticism is over. There are too many cases to ignore, too much evidence to deny. This video presents ten true cases of firsthand extraterrestrial encounters from across the globe, each providing important information and profound insights into the UFO phenomenon. Many have multiple witnesses and compelling evidence in the form of landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and physiological effects. It’s time for all humanity to accept the truth of the ET presence on Earth.

THE UFO GOBLINS. On the morning of March 15, 1943, sisters “C,” (10) and Angela (6) were grazing the family goat by their home in the small town of Montecreste, Italy. Suddenly a “great roar” overhead caught their attention and they saw a saucer-shaped craft land nearby. Two figures in white jumpsuits exited and talked in a weird language. Knowing nothing of UFOs and ETs, the girls thought they saw goblins.

FOUR ALIENS IN THE BACKYARD. At 2am on October 13, 1975, Mayme H awoke to her dog barking. Looking outside her home in Alton, Illinois, she saw a 3½-foot-tall humanoid in a silver jumpsuit in her backyard. Moments later, it was joined by three others, and all four ran single-file into the forest behind her home. The next morning, they found a circle of crushed grass in a field not far from the location.

HIGHWAY HUMANOID. At 9:45 pm, January 26, 1976, Claude Cretin was driving between Madilly-Mandelot and Bouze-les-Beaune in France when a flash of light blinded him. A short distance ahead, he saw a tall humanoid in a fluorescent red bodysuit and helmet with a face-mask standing by the road. He drove off in fear and went to the police. Returning to the site the next morning, they found broken branches 10-15 feet high.

THE MEN FROM THE STAR. Just past midnight on January 28, 1976, Miguel Fernandez Carrasco was walking to his home in Benacazon, Spain when a star-like object approached. Suddenly it landed next to him. It was a strange craft. Two 7-foot-tall humanoids exited and approached. Miguel ran in fear. The humanoids went back into the craft and then followed him from above, sending down a beam of light, causing Miguel to pass out. He awoke two hours later in front of his home, with strange marks on his body. 

ANOTHER FLYING HUMANOID. At 5:00 am on April 7, 1977, former politician Cyril John saw light flood his home in Milford Haven, Wales. Looking out the window, he saw an oval-shaped craft hovering 200 feet away. Then he saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid wearing a silver-gray suit, hovering just 35 feet away. He watched both object and humanoid for the next half-hour until they slowly moved off into the distance.

AN ALIEN MEETING. On the afternoon of Sep 27, 1978, Henryk Marciniak took his motorcycle to a wooded area outside Kanin, Poland to pick edible mushrooms. Suddenly he saw a metallic craft landed in a clearing. Two short humanoids in black jumpsuits exited and approached him. They had greenish-skin, webbed hands, and large bulging eyes. They showed interest in both his motorcycle and the mushrooms, then took off in their craft.

RIGHT OVER THE CAR. At 5:30 pm on Nov 13, 1982, two men driving to Port Wakefield in South Australia saw an object pacing their car. Suddenly it was right overhead and looking up, they saw right into the front of the craft. They could see several humanoids inside and all kinds of weird equipment. Frightened, they panicked and drove off. Soon other people in the area began to report UFOs.

100 LITTLE ALIENS. At 5:45 pm on October 28, 1985, a dozen children were playing outside their homes in Honefoss, Norway when a UFO appeared overhead and seemed to land. As it disappeared, they suddenly saw a huge crowd of tiny humanoids running around. They were dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. For the next two hours, they ran around the area, causing some children to flee in panic. Later strange footprints were found. 

THE ALIENS IN THE BUSHES. One afternoon in Oct 1986, farmer Alberto Meyer was shocked to see two 5-foot-tall humanoids emerge from the brush near his home in Viale, Entre Rios, Argentina. They had huge hairless heads, small facial features, and wore skintight jumpsuits. One seemed to smile at Alberto as they returned to the brush. Later, a footprint was found and photographed. More UFOs were soon seen.

HUMANOIDS ABOVE A CITY STREET. At 9pm on Jan 19, 1991, Helge F walked along Markt Street in Ronneburg, Germany when a powerful wind struck her. Looking up, she saw a craft 100 feet overhead. It tilted toward her, revealing three strange humanoids inside. Helge found herself waving at them. One pointed a strange rod at her. The craft moved off. Helge found she was missing about 15 minutes of time.

These ten cases are a tiny portion of the actual number of cases, each of which provide further evidence that we are not alone, that ETs are visiting our planet. The truth can no longer be denied. They are here.

While governments across the world now admit to the validity UFOs, they still refuse to discuss firsthand contact cases. The heart of the UFO phenomenon is not the craft, but the UFO occupants themselves. The evidence shows clearly that UFOs are craft, piloted by living beings. The thousands of humanoid cases can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. This video presents ten cases of very close encounters with humanoids of all kinds. They span more than 100 years, come from across the world, and many contain compelling evidence to support them.

THE SMILING EXTRATERRESTRIAL. One morning in the Summer of 1915, Bjarne Westvand (age 6) was playing outside his home in Jakobsbakken, Norway when a craft landed, and out stepped two three-foot-tall figures with large heads, long hair, gray skin. One walked right up to him then turned around and departed. It was an experience he kept secret for 65 years.

QUARRY ALIEN. At 2:05 pm on May 30, 1971, Pierrette Debofle stepped outside her home in Dannes, France to collect some grass for her rabbits. Looking up, she saw a strange craft in the chalk quarry behind her house. Then she saw a three-foot-tall figure with a large glowing head and a bulky torso, walking and floating near the craft. Suddenly it went inside it and the craft took off at high speed.

THE GITCHIE-MANITOU UFO WAVE. One night in mid-April 1976, Linda Sehr of Lyon, Iowa saw a UFO near the Gitchie-Manitou State Park. To her shock, it followed her car home. One month later Andy and Joel Rygh (age 8 and 6) were playing the park when they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid. They ran and told their two older brothers, and all four saw a craft dart away. Soon more encounters would occur.

CURED OF ARTHRITIS. At 8pm on September 6, 1976, Leoncio and Elena Torres were driving through a rural area of Carabaya, Peru when a UFO landed on the road in front of them. Two human-looking figures came out, approached them, and touched them both on the back. They felt burning heat and the figures left. Afterward there were landing traces on the road, and both Leoncio and Elena were cured of their arthritis.

THE LITTLE MAN OF DUNN, NORTH CAROLINA. On October 12, 1976, eight-year-old Tonnlie Barefoot was playing outside his home in Dunn, NC when he saw a little one-foot-tall man staring at him. The tiny man ran away. Tonnlie told his mother and others, but nobody believed him. Then they found the footprints. Two weeks later, Shirley Ann McCrimmon was entering her home only a few miles away when she also saw a little man. But was this an ET or something else?

THE ALIEN COUPLE. On the night of August 30, 1977, Ceferina Vargas Martin was walking home in Escalada, Spain when a powerful light hit her face. Seconds later, she saw a very odd-looking man and woman with large eyes, two slits for a nose, a thin mouth and yellowish skin. Both wore strange clothes. A powerful weakness swept over her and she fainted. Upon awakening, the couple was gone, and so were some of Ceferina’s belongings.

A VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTER. On November 1, 1980, sisters Kristina Rydhold and Nina Grundin were driving to their parents’ home near Hovsta, Sweden when a UFO began to circle overhead. Without warning it approached to within 50 feet, close enough that they could both see two humanoids inside it. Their car stalled and began to shake mysteriously. Finally the craft left, but this was only one of several close encounters in the area at that time.

PICNIC WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL. On the afternoon of April 26, 1984, a few hundred teachers and students went for an outside picnic at rural Monte Sant’Antonio near Macomer, Italy. A teacher and student went exploring and both saw a strange short humanoid. They were unable to move until it left. Moments later, a craft rose from the ground, leaving landing traces. Soon, another student saw the strange humanoid.

MISSING TIME IN MIRABEL. Around 4am one morning in August 2012, a man and woman traveled by motorcycle outside of Mirabel, Canada. Suddenly a UFO appeared overhead. It sent down a beam of light, striking them. The man saw strange humanoids looking down at him. Afterwards, they drove off and forgot everything. Months later, the man suddenly remembered the encounter. The woman, however, had no memory of any humanoids.

THE ALIEN IN THE RECTANGLE. On the night of September 8, 2012, Konnonova Irina Dmitrievna was outside her home in Penza, Ternovka, Russia when she noticed a glowing rectangle of red light in the sky. As it approached, the light changed shape and she could see a humanoid inside, facing her. It soon moved off. But a short time later and a few miles away, another woman saw a very similar object.

Ten cases, each offering a glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face encounter with strange humanoids, each providing another piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. The evidence speaks for itself: we are not alone!

A face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial humanoid – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s happening to a lot of people. It’s been happening all over the world for a very long time. While governments across the world are admitting that UFOs are real, they refuse to talk about firsthand contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids. These include multiple witness cases with a wide variety of supporting evidence. Time for truth!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. It was 10am one summer morning in 1948 when Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and two others were on the Canadian National Railroad by Chapais, Quebec, Canada when a UFO appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, quickly fled. The UFO flew off with a noise so loud, it made the witnesses physically ill.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland when a tall green humanoid appeared, floating above his head. Anssi biked away in fear. The being disappeared into a craft, which continued to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a weird liquid as Anssi raced home.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms by his home in Bedarrides, France when he saw what appeared to be two small children. But they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, several children from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object approach. In moments, it came overhead, stopped, and landed a short distance away. Both boys saw a humanoid looking out at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with porthole hovering near their farm. It then ejected two figures with glowing red eyes who approached the farm and began to inspect the sheds. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the environment around him lit up like daylight, and a UFO appeared on a nearby hill. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by four humanoids. He fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10pm on November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was in his home in Daviken, Sweden when he noticed an odd-looking figure in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture, and was wearing a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to investigate, the figure disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police officer had an encounter the same night, and his neighbor also saw a strange humanoid.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one evening in the summer of 1999 when a 14-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching sound coming from outside the second-story bedroom window of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange 3-foot-tall creature with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed in, and saw it too. The creature remained for 15 minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a tiny portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. We are being visited.

With nearly a million reported and documented UFO encounters, it is clear that we are not alone in this universe. ETs are visiting our planet, and people all over the world are encountering humanoids of many different kinds. This video presents ten super-strange cases of humanoid encounters, many with multiple witnesses and compelling evidence. Face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials provide important insights into the UFO phenomenon and answer many of the questions surrounding this subject.

POLICE OFFICERS SEE LANDED UFO AND HUMANOIDS. At 1am one evening in January 1956, French gendarmes (Henri Barboule and Msr Simon) were in Barre-des-Cevennes, France, when they heard a deafening roar. Looking up, they saw a flying saucer pass overhead and land a short distance away. As the craft released a probe, four humanoids exited the craft. Both officers were paralyzed with fear.

UFO LANDS IN CITY PARK. Around 9:30 pm on the night of December 9, 1962, driver/waiter Antonio Candau was walking to his home near Bologna, Italy when he saw a flying saucer land nearby. He watched in awe as two olive-skinned human-looking men wearing yellow jumpsuits exited. The two men approached him, speaking a strange language and gesturing to him. The experience changed Antonio’s life.

FOLLOWED BY A UFO. One night in January 1973, five people were driving near Nowra, NSW, Australia when a UFO appeared and began pacing their car. One of the passengers was shocked to see humanoid figures looking out at him through the portholes. The craft followed their vehicle for many miles, before suddenly darting away. The next morning, one of the witnesses would have another encounter.

THE CLUMSY ROBOT. Early in the morning of July 10, 1976, Miguel Angel Ruiz Samperio, and his friend, Margarita Cagigas were getting ready to car-pool to work when they saw a strange figure walking down the street of their home town of Escalante, Spain. To their shock, it looked robotic and was at least nine feet tall. After walking off, it disappeared. They later learned that other people saw it too.

ALIENS AT THE FRONT DOOR. On the night of July 11, 1978, “Amalia,” was in her home in Alta da Mooca, Brazil when she heard a thump and a strange buzzing noise, her dog began to bark, and her TV filled with static. Opening the door, she was confronted by two short humanoids and a landed UFO behind them. She was paralyzed as the figures shone strange lights around and returned to their craft, which took off, leaving Amalia utterly shocked.

UFO LANDS AT SUGAR-CANE FARM. Late at night on April 26, 1979, farmer Mamerto Demetillo was woken up by light filling his home in Talisay, the Philippines. Rushing outside, he saw three flying saucers landing next to his farm. He watched as two human-looking figures exited each craft, and examined the area. After 20 minutes, they returned inside the craft which took off, leaving landing traces. At the time, there was a wave of sightings in the area.

THE MOST REMARKABLE THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. One night in the fall of 1989, shortly after reading some UFO books, an anonymous witness saw a UFO outside her home near the Apalachicola Forest in Florida. Suddenly, a glowing sphere emerged from the craft and entered through her window. An eight-foot-tall figure appeared. The witness fainted and for 2 years, forgot the encounter.

YOU ARE ME. On the night March 9, 1992, two women were driving to their homes in Hamar, Norway when a saucer with two short humanoids hovered in front of their car. They both experienced missing time. Later that night, one of the witnesses, Gry Jannicke Jarlum, was visited at her home. She remained in contact with the ETs who began to teach her volumes of profound information, completely changing her life forever.

A ROADSIDE GRAY. While driving to his home in Cary, Illinois one evening in March 1995, an anonymous man was shocked to see a short strange-looking figure alongside the road. Thinking it was the victim of a car accident, he slowed down, and was amazed to see a short figure with a large bald head, huge dark oval eyes, and pale white skin. It was not human, and the witness drove off in shock.

THE MEN IN THE SKY. On the night of April 26, 2009, a man in his home in Bad Neuenahr, Germany noticed a brilliant light in the sky. He watched it approach, revealing itself to be a multi-colored rectangular craft with numerous portholes. And through the portholes he saw the silhouettes of several figures looking out at him from only 100 feet away. He was convinced it was a genuine UFO, and watched as it flew slowly away.

Ten super-strange alien encounters from all over the world! And there are so many more. How many cases are needed to prove to the world that we are not alone? Earth is being visited by extraterrestrials of many kinds. The truth can no longer be denied, covered up or explained away. The evidence speaks for itself.

Can you imagine being taken onboard a craft and meeting extraterrestrials face-to-face? It is perhaps the ultimate encounter. This video presents five astonishing cases of people taken onboard an ET craft. While each of these cases does involve a single witness, every one of them was recalled consciously without hypnosis. And every one of them includes compelling evidence pointing to the reality of the encounter. They come from all over the world, and provide a close-up look at what it’s like to meet aliens face-to-face. They also answer many of the questions surrounding ET contact and their agenda on planet Earth.

THE CASE OF WARABE AMANAKA. It was a summer evening in 1926 when 2-year-old Warabe Amanaka heard a telepathic voice calling him outside. Venturing outside his home in Matsuyama, Japan, he was greeted by a tall, blond-haired human-looking figure who promised to meet him again. Over the next three years, the man (who Warabe called Uncle) appeared several times. Then on Aug 2, 1930, Warabe (age 5) heard the familiar telepathic voice and met Uncle again. This time, Warabe was taken onboard a craft, and given a ride around the planet, viewing whales in the ocean, elephants in Africa and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. After being dropped back home, the ETs promised to visit him again. During one of his visits, the ETs gave Warabe a strange metal box. It’s one of Japan’s strangest cases on record.

THE CASE OF NICHOLAS HENRY EDWARDS. In Jul 1952, at age nine, Nicholas Edwards was outside his home near Point Defiance Park in Washington State, when he saw a UFO and then found himself in a strange room surrounded by little aliens. Shortly later, he and his entire family had a close up sighting of a UFO. But it wasn’t until November 15, 1959 that Nick (now 16) recalled a lengthy and complicated onboard encounter. While driving with two friends in California, a UFO pulled their car onboard. Nick’s two friends fell unconscious, but Nick remained awake as small human-like ETs with large dark eyes and pale skin pulled him from the car and took him to another room. The ETs were kind and gentle as they put him on a table and examined him with strange instruments. The encounter changed his life forever.

THE CASE OF KLAUS-DIETER KAUFMANN. At 8:30 pm one night in the Spring of 1960, 14-year-old Klaus-Dieter Kaufmann walked to his home in Frankfurt, Germany. Suddenly a Saturn-shaped craft hovered overhead. A beam of light came down, struck him, and rendered him unconscious. He woke up a few hours later. Terrified, he ran home and found a strange mark on his back. Years later, as an adult, he went to have surgery and the doctor told him that it looked like he had already had surgery on his back. Klaus-Dieter recalled his missing time encounter with the UFO, and began to remember what happened. He recalled going onboard the craft, meeting different kinds of humanoids, who gave him a strange exam. Although frightened, one of the ETs comforted him and explained that he would be returned home shortly.

THE CASE OF GILBERTO GREGORIO COCCIOLI. At 3am on Oct 4, 1972, Gilberto Coccioli (age 50) stepped outside his home in Burzaco, Argentina to check on his dog. Without warning, he was struck by a beam of light and pulled onboard a craft hovering overhead. Inside, he was confronted by 7-foot-tall humanoids who placed him on a circular bench, and examined him. He saw many things beyond his comprehension. Two other women were onboard and had intimate relations with him. He saw a small pile of stones and convinced the ETs to give him one. Then he was placed back on the ground, with the stone in his hand. His dog was badly traumatized. The stone turned out to be earthly iron pyrite. Gilberto remained in contact with the ETs, who began to teach him science, philosophy, and spirituality.

THE CASE OF ISTVAN BALOGH. On the night of Dec 26, 1991, Istvan Balogh (a 21-year-old border guard) returned home to find a flying saucer hovering over his backyard in Bekes, Hungary. A week prior to this, he had heard a strange telepathic message, repeating, “You will meet us.” He was unable to resist as he was pulled onboard the craft where he was greeted by short humanoids, four feet tall with greenish skin, large eyes, and three fingers on each hand. They told him that they had watched him for three years and would take him on a trip. He recalls seeing the moon and other strange sights before being returned to his yard. He told his superiors what happened to him and was promptly fired. A psychiatric exam showed him to be a normal, but a physical exam showed that a metal rod which had been placed after breaking his arm, was now missing.

These 5 cases show that people all over the world are being taken onboard UFOs and that it has been happening for a long time. This kind of experience is far more common than most people believe. The evidence speaks for itself: we are not alone!

So many humanoids! Encounters with humanoids and extraterrestrials are far more common than most people believe. Cases come from across the world and have been occurring for a long time. And in almost all cases people describe humanoid figures. In fact, the humanoid form appears to be universal. This video presents twelve amazing humanoid encounters from 1940 to 2009. Some are single-witness cases, but most have multiple witnesses, and a few have compelling physical evidence in support of their case. There are now enough documented cases to conclude that we are not alone on planet Earth. We are being visited.

SOLDIERS OR ALIENS. In July of 1940, a 15-year-old boy from Kongens Tisded, Denmark was going to water his cattle when he came upon three figures wearing jumpsuits and helmets. To his shock, they approached a landed disc-shaped craft which took off silently. He thought they might be German soldiers, but later realized he may have encountered ETs.

THE OLD THIN ALIEN. One day in the summer of 1951, three people went to a play in Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritime, France. Approaching the theater, they saw a small transparent craft low in the sky, and inside it was an old, thin, man with a beard, watching the play. The witnesses tried to alert the audience, but the craft quickly darted away.

THE ARTISTS & THE ALIENS. At 3:30 am on December 28, 1954, seven people drove along Route 143 near Mendoza, Argentina. Suddenly, they came upon a landed craft and two humanoids along the road. They exited their vehicle and got a closer look, as the humanoids scrambled into their craft. The witnesses retreated to their car and left, and the UFO followed!

A CHURCH-GOING ALIEN. On the night of June 26, 1962, the Massolongo family was in their home in Verona, Italy when they saw a UFO hover over the Santa Anastasia Church. It remained there so long, they finally went to bed. Later that night, a glowing green humanoid approached the bedroom window and touched the daughter. All three witnesses watched it leave.

AN APPOINTMENT WITH HUMANOIDS. On October 29, 1965, Sture Johnson received a message that she and her husband Turid (a famous medium) should visit a certain location in Vagarro, Sweden. They went there that evening, and to their amazement encountered black floating humanoids. But were these ETs, or were they something else entirely?

THE ETS BY THE HOSPITAL. At 10:30 am on September 14, 1967, Fabio J Diniz (age 16) was walking by the Baleia Hospital in Belo Horizonte, Brazil when he saw a landed saucer in a nearby field. Two tall humanoids exited and told Fabio to return the next day for another contact. Unfortunately the craft did not return, but it did leave behind landing traces.

THE RECUMBENT ALIENS. One night in September 1973, a couple and their friend were driving near Alijo, Portugal when a glowing disc began to pace their car. Suddenly the car mysteriously broke down. The disc left, then returned. and all three witnesses saw two humanoids lying on their backs alongside the road. The humanoids rose and flew over the car and were gone.

LANDING AND HUMANOIDS IN BOZEMAN. One summer evening in 1978, “Bob” was driving outside of Bozeman, Montana when he saw a bright light alongside the road. Thinking there was a fire, he stopped to investigate. Instead he saw a landed craft and three little humanoids. He hid and watched until the humanoids entered the craft which took off and was gone.

A SUNNY DAY WITH ALIENS. One day in May 1979, a family of four exited their apartment in Toronto, Canada when they saw a huge oval-shaped craft hovering mere feet above their building. To their amazement, about thirty humanoid figures were visible through the portholes. They watched for 10 minutes until the craft zoomed away at high speed.

THE LITTLE BOY IN THE UFO. At 6pm on Sep 1, 1984, six-year-old Nao Nishimoto was amazed to see a flying saucer hovering over the field in front of her home in Takamatsu, Japan. Suddenly a face appeared in one of the portholes. It was a little boy, smiling down at her. As the craft left, the little boy waved goodbye.

THE SMILING ALIENS. One night in July 1992, Reuben Taylor and his mom drove long the 101 Freeway in Echo Park, near Los Angeles, California when a huge craft appeared overhead. The craft moved closer and they were amazed to see several human-looking ETs looking down and smiling at them.

ALIEN TOUR BUS. One night in November 2009, an anonymous man was in his home in Schwindegg, Germany when he noticed an object in the sky only 300 feet away. It looked like a floating bus, and inside he saw several humanoid figures staring back at him. He shouted in fear as the UFO quickly moved away.

These twelve cases are just a small sample of the huge number of documented accounts of humanoids coming from across the world. These cases make it clear that we live in a universe populated by all different kinds of people. We are not alone!

So many cases of humanoids! The general public has no real idea just how many people are having these experiences. This video presents twelve incredible cases of humanoid encounters from across the planet, from the 1950s to the 2020s. Robotic entities, human-looking ETs, little green men, grays, and more. And of course, compelling evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, landing traces, medical effects, and more. Truth is coming out!

BACKYARD ALIENS. Around 9pm on December 15, 1956, Marie Carow stepped into her backyard in Conashaugh, PA. She was hoping to see deer, but instead observed two four-foot-tall helmeted figures staring at her. She called her husband, but he refused to come outside. Later, she found out her neighbors saw a UFO at the same time.

HUMANOIDS IN PONTEJOS. On the evening of January 9, 1969, four employees at a café-bar in Pontejos, Spain received an incredible shock when they saw a UFO with five humanoids hovering right across the street. Unknown to them, another witness also viewed the object. It remained for a short time then darted away. Could it have been interested in a nearby nuclear facility?

ROCK-COLLECTING ALIENS. Around 4am one evening in February 1969, a family of four was awakened by light streaming into their home along the beach near Nuble, Chile. Looking outside, they watched a strange craft land and tall humanoids emerge, poke the sand with weird tubes, and start collecting rocks. After the encounter, they all broke out in a strange rash.

ENCOUNTER WITH A UFO PILOT. On October 5, 1971, pilot Jose Americo Medeiros and three other student pilots were coming in for a landing at Santos Dumont Airport in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when a UFO began pacing their plane. Suddenly it darted forward and crossed right in front of them. They were shocked to see a gray-skinned humanoid looking right at them.

THE ALIENS AT THE TRAIN STATION. Just before midnight on June 25, 1974, three employees of the Tandil Railway Station in Argentina were shocked to see a bright light outside, followed by the appearance of a short, bearded humanoid. It disappeared after a few moments. One of the men was so traumatized, he suffered a nervous breakdown. The next day, two other people also reported a humanoid in the same area.

THE ROBOT IN THE FOREST. On the night of August 15, 1974, a group of nine witnesses observed a boxy-looking, glowing white, robotic-figure in the La Pelouse Park of Bouxiere-Aux-Dames, France. Soon more witnesses also began reporting a strange glowing figure in the same area. Researchers later discovered a long history of encounters in the area dating back to the 1920s.

LANDING IN TASMANIA. Early one morning in February 1976, an anonymous gentleman from Kettering, Tasmania saw a strange craft come in for a crash landing. Rushing to the site, he was shocked instead to see a small disc-shaped object landed a short distance away. He could see strange forms inside the craft. When it departed, weird landing traces were left on the ground.

HUMANOIDS IN LITTLE HAVEN. In the middle of the night on April 19, 1977, Rosa Grenville, a hotelier at the Haven Fort Hotel in Little Haven, Wales was shocked to see a landed UFO and humanoids right outside her window. Viewing through binoculars she was amazed to see that they wore strange jumpsuits. She tried to wake her husband, but the craft took off before he could see it.

THREE HUMANOIDS IN A SATURN-SHAPED UFO. After seeing strange lights throughout early July 1979 over their home in Schiedam, the Netherlands, two teenagers were amazed to see a Saturn-shaped craft with humanoids inside it, hovering very near the balcony of their home. They also began reporting a wide variety of psychic events.

LITTLE GREEN MEN. While driving to her home in Niva, Denmark late on the evening of September 28, 1988, an anonymous woman was shocked to see two very short greenish humanoids with large heads and pointed chins walking along the road. She pulled a U-turn to get a closer look, but they were gone.

THE ALIEN IN THE WINDOW. On the night of June 27, 2014, a woman from St-Croix, Quebec, Canada was amazed to see a UFO over her home. When her son arrived home shortly later, he reported seeing a short, large-headed humanoid peering in through the backdoor window.

THE ALIENS BY THE CROSS. On May 3, 2022, 88-year-old Lyubov Danilova Smolskaya of Belarus, Russia woke to her home filling with light. Looking outside she saw a landed craft and two bizarre-looking humanoids. They shone a beam of light on her, then got into the craft which floated away. After it was gone, strange landing traces were found.

These twelve incredible humanoid encounter cases make it very clear that people all over the world are having these experiences. There are too many cases to ignore, explain away or cover-up. The truth can no longer be denied. UFOs are real, and we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

Humanoid and alien encounters! They are perhaps the most fascinating aspect of ufology, and have so much to teach us about the ET agenda. This video presents ten cases from all over the world involving a wide variety of extraterrestrials. There are human-looking ETs, little dwarfs, frog-like beings, flying humanoids and more. Many involve multiple witnesses and startling physical evidence such as landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions and electromagnetic disturbances. There are too many cases to ignore, deny or explain away. Something very profound is happening here.

TEN LITTLE ALIENS. One evening in January 1931, cattle-herder Helge Eriksson was walking to his home in Eslov, Sweden when he saw a crowd of ten little men coming towards him. They were only about four feet tall, with oversized heads and long beards. They wore one piece robes with hoods and seemed to float across the ground. They paid no attention to Helge and moved up to a brilliant light source and were gone.

THE ET IN THE PURPLE CAPE. It was a sunny afternoon on February 29, 1964 as David and Ken (age 10 and 9) saw a saucer land near their homes in Plympton, South Australia. To their shock, a door opened and out stepped a human-looking ET with copper-red skin and a big nose. It wore a strange suit with a purple cape. As soon as it saw the boys, it fled back into its craft, which promptly took off. Interestingly, not far away, another lady in Gum Tree, South Australia saw a very similar-looking ET.

THE ALIENS ON THE HIGHWAY. Around 4am on August 23, 1967, Stanley Moxon was driving near Joyceville, Ontario, Canada when he saw a glowing green craft descending alongside the road. He turned off his headlights, drove up to it, and flicked on his headlights. To his shock, it had landed, and two short ETs were outside picking plants. Surprised, they flew back into the craft which took off straight up.

THE FLYING HUMANOID. One night in 1967, Patricia K and her fiancé were driving near Wolstanton, England when she saw a classic flying saucer. It flew away before her fiancé could see it. But eight years later, their 8-year-old son was drawn to look outside by a loud buzzing noise. To his amazement, he saw two 3-foot-tall humanoids flying past his window mere feet away.

I WOULD NOT HARM A HAIR ON YOUR HEAD. Around 3:15 am on January 8, 1974, John E Justice was driving to his home in Springfield, Ohio when his car stalled and his lights went out. Instantly, a brilliant rainbow-colored light appeared, transforming into a small craft. Inside, he was shocked to see five female humanoids, each about four feet tall, with super-long hair. The craft darted away after a few moments, but one year later, he had an even more startling encounter with a humanoid.

I WAS REALLY AFRAID. On the night of November 17, 1975, two college students, Dave Vardeman and Suzanne Erenberger watched a brilliant light descend to the ground near Cedar-Rapids, Iowa. Suzanne was amazed to see a metallic craft with two humanoids inside. But strangely, Dave didn’t remember seeing any craft or humanoids. All he recalls is that they were both frightened enough to flee the area and call the police.

FIFTY FROG-LIKE ETS. At 9pm on May 2, 1976, Dominique Menuge was driving near Matton France when reflections off the side of the road caught his eye. To his shock, he saw about fifty 4-foot-tall frog-like humanoids standing motionless in the field. Terrified, he fled the area, but not before he saw one of the humanoids standing only a few feet away from his car.

ALMOST ABDUCTED BY ALIENS. On September 9, 1976, Hermelindo Silva was walking home with his dog when a UFO appeared overhead. Suddenly it sent down 4 cables with hooks. Short little humanoids came out of the craft and managed to grab him, hook his ankle and pull him up towards the craft. Hermelindo fought with them and freed himself, but not without sustaining some serious injuries.

UNNATURAL EYES. On the night of March 13, 1977, 17-year-old Stephen Taylor was walking to his home in Pembroke, Wales when he saw a brilliant orange craft. He ran away, but shortly later, he came upon the craft, now landed in a field. Then an odd humanoid with frog-like eyes, wearing a jumpsuit walked right up to him. Stephen swung a punch, missed, and ran home in complete terror.

THE ALIEN WITH A MUSTACHE. On the night of December 1, 1977, Emilio Ruiz woke to find the bedroom of his home in Puente San Miguel, Spain, filling with light. Looking out the window, he saw a tall figure approach and peer inside. To his shock, it wasn’t human. He screamed and the figure walked away. Later, he discovered that numerous people in the town had seen unexplained lights.

Ten cases, from across the planet, all involving a wide variety of humanoids and aliens. These cases show that contact with ETs can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The evidence cannot be denied. We are not alone!

UFO contact is known for high strangeness. When people encounter ETs face-to-face, or are 
taken onboard, things can go from strange to truly bizarre. This video presents five cases 
from across the world, which contain incredibly odd and unique elements of high 
strangeness. Each of these five cases include sightings, landings, humanoids, and an 
onboard experience. Each contain physical evidence of some kind or another. These cases 
have some remarkable insights into the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon.

THE CASE OF CATHIE CONNELLY. In the summer of 1940, Cathie Connelly was walking down a 
country lane in Meriden, England when she came upon a small, strange structure. There 
were tall odd-looking men wearing jumpsuits standing near it. When she returned later, 
it was gone. Later, while working at a factory, she saw one of the men she had seen next 
to this craft, and he told Cathie that he was an ET. So began Cathie’s contacts. She was 
soon taken onboard. She saw human-looking people and blue-skinned beings with cat-like 
eyes. She was physically examined and given a tour of the craft. They took her to an 
active war-area and to New York, showing her the Statue of Liberty. Many other incidents 
of high strangeness occurred, including going back in time to certain childhood events, 
and to a country in Africa.

THE CASE OF ARNE-HARDER JORGENSEN. One day in Aug of 1956, Arne-Harder Jorgensen (age 10) 
played Cowboys & Indians with his friends near his home in Vaklev, Denmark. Suddenly he 
heard foreign-sounding voices and laughter. Peaking outside of his hiding place, he saw 
three short, bald humanoids wearing jumpsuits and eating berries from a berry bush. 
Suddenly the ETs turned and stared right at him. Arne tried to run, but found that he 
couldn’t move. One of the humanoids studied him up and down, and walked away. Then, a 
silver saucer-shape craft took off. Arne’s paralysis lifted. He ran home to find that 
it was now dusk. The next morning, they discovered four deep holes in the ground. Also 
three chickens were missing from a neighbor’s coop. Later, Arne had two close-up UFO 
sightings.

THE CASE OF ONILSON PATERO. On the night of May 22, 1973, Onilson Patero was driving to 
his him in Catanduva, Brazil when he picked up a hitchhiker, a young blond-haired, blue-
eyed man. As he dropped off the hitchhiker, the man said they would meet again. 
Continuing his drive, Onilson’s car suddenly lost power. A UFO appeared and shone a 
beam of light onto his car, turning it transparent. Onilson ran from his car and fainted. 
He was found unconscious lying next to the road. One year later, on the night of Apr 26, 
1974, Onilson saw another UFO. He was struck by a beam of light, and taken onboard, 
where he saw the same hitchhiker. Onilson was given an exam and experienced many strange 
events onboard, including seeing his own twin, being taken to another country in Europe 
and more. The ETs dropped him off. It was now six days later and he was 745 miles from 
his original location.

THE CASE OF DAVID HAMEL. On Oct 12, 1975, David Hamel (a carpenter,) his wife Ruth and 
a friend were watching TV in his home in Maple Ridge, Canada. Suddenly the TV screen 
became staticky and two Asian-looking figures appeared and pulled David up into a craft. 
David was given a tour of the craft, and volumes of scientific and philosophical 
information. The ETs warned him about nuclear power, and then told him that they would 
give him detailed instructions about how to build a free-energy motor. Returning him to 
his home, David’s life changed as he remained in contact with the ETs. David began a 
lifelong quest to build a UFO craft, using a concept of counter-rotating magnets. 
David spent thousands of dollars and eventually built a motor, which spontaneously 
exploded. He continued his efforts, eventually attracting the attention of prominent 
scientists. Two books have been written about his case.

THE CASE OF ELIZABETH HESS. In 1954, 13-year-old Elizabeth Hess (pseudonym) and her 
mother experienced missing time during a trip to the store near their home in New 
York City. Years later, in November 1989, Elizabeth woke up to find three strange 
humanoids in her Manhattan apartment. They led her down the street to the Hudson 
River, where she met a tall gray and 30 other people who had also been led there. 
A strange experience followed where Elizabeth was instructed to pick a glass and 
give it to a homeless woman. Next, Elizabeth was back in her home, undergoing a 
medical procedure at the hands of the ETs, who told her to quit smoking and eating 
chocolate. Later, Elizabeth had miscarriages where the fetus was missing.

These five cases typify the high strangeness that is so often present during UFO 
contact. They reveal some of the ETs’ agendas on this planet, and that people all 
over the world are experiencing contact with a wide variety of humanoids. The 
evidence speaks for itself. We are not alone!

There are many different kinds of strange humanoids being reported by people all over the world, and it’s been happening for a long time. It’s definitely not just grays! In fact, the variety of ET types is far more numerous than most people realize. This video presents ten cases from across the world, spanning five decades, from the 1950s to the 1990s. Many involve multiple witnesses and different forms of evidence. But most fascinating are all the amazing kinds of ETs.

BROWN-SKINNED MIDGET ETS. One afternoon in the Fall of 1957, a 15-year-old boy was working in the fields south of the small town of Ejstrupholm, Denmark when a metallic craft landed just 100 feet away. To his utter shock, two 3-foot-tall brown-skinned ETs wearing transparent helmets emerged. After a few minutes, they returned to the craft, which took off. The witness was so amazed, he told almost nobody.

LOVERS LANE ALIENS. Late one evening in the Fall of 1966, a young couple drove to an isolated location outside of Rockford, Illinois to enjoy each other’s company in private. Without warning, a bright light appeared overhead. They quickly pulled a U-turn to flee the area, but before they could get away, they saw two gray figures with big black eyes staring back at them. It was an experience they would never forget.

THE ETS IN MELON FIELD. Around dusk on September 12, 1971, Juan Rodriguez Dominguez, who worked as a guard for the giant El Lunarejo melon farm in Aznalcollar, Spain, got the shock of his life when a massive, silver, torpedo-shaped craft landed a short distance away. Dozens of tiny figures wearing uniforms emerged. When Juan confronted them, the ETs chased him, shooting paralyzing lights rays at him.

NUCLEAR RESEARCHER HUMANOID ENCOUNTER. On the night of June 29, 1973, a nuclear researcher/professor was driving with his wife south of Chalk River, Ontario, Canada when they noticed a star-like object pacing their car. Soon it came closer, revealing itself to be a spherical craft with portholes, and through them they could see humanoid figures. And it crossed the road right in front of their car.

HUMANOID INVESTIGATES GRAVESITE. On the evening of July 23, 1977, a family in Lindley, New York were shocked to see multiple UFOs, and then little humanoids running around their backyard. They watched it do strange things to a gravestone nearby. The witnesses finally called the police and the UFOs and humanoids quickly left. But this was just the beginning of a weeks-long series of incredible encounters.

THE ETS IN THE FLYING BOX. One Summer evening in 1978, an anonymous gentleman was walking his dog near his home in Beeston, England when he saw something he could hardly believe: a box-shaped craft floating just above the rooftops. Most amazing, inside he saw several 10-foot-tall skinny figures wearing strange jumpsuits. A few of them saw the witness and waved at him before slowly moving away.

ETS OFFER CAKE. On the evening of December 3, 1979, teen-ager Lilli-Ann Karlsson was taking a walk in the park near her home in Vastervick, Sweden. Suddenly paralyzed, she found herself confronted by a craft in the field right next to her. Two ETs emerged and began to float towards her. They were 5 feet tall, white and glowing. They approached her, holding a piece of what looked like chocolate cake.

THREE LITTLE FLOATING ALIENS. Around dusk on January 12, 1983, Ed Eggen (pseudonym) and his two young sons were shocked to see a little bald man wearing a gray jumpsuit outside their home in Pine Township, Indiana. They ran outside to investigate. Seconds later, they noticed a second figure, and then a third. They approached within feet of them before all three figures converged and darted off into the sky.

THE GLOWING GIANT. Late in the evening of March 6, 1983, Madame Fauquembergue was in her home in Pas-de-Calais, France when she noticed a strange glowing figure moving around outside her home. Looking more closely, she saw it was 7 or 8 feet tall and wearing a silver jumpsuit. Earlier that evening, she and her family had been puzzled when the entire house lit up with light.

THE SHRUGGING GRAY. It was about 2:00 am on July 21, 1991, when 3 young girls decided to go outside and jump on the trampoline in the backyard of their home in a small town in central Missouri. They all saw a strange light, and moments later, a 4-foot-tall gray figure approached them. The girls fled into their home, but the gray then began to stare at them through the window, and kept doing for a period of hours.

These ten cases provide a small sample of the huge number of cases taking place across the planet. These cases show unique aspects and corroborating similarities. The evidence includes landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, and more. Each case provides another piece of the puzzle, and shows us that we are not alone. Humans are just one of many types of intelligent life in this vast universe.

UFO sightings, landings and face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials are all undeniably interesting. But perhaps the most extraordinary of all UFO encounters are cases where people have been taken onboard a craft. These cases leave little room for misperception or denial. They represent the cutting edge of UFO research, and make it very clear that we are not alone. This video presents five extensive onboard UFO encounters from across the world. Three of these cases involve multiple witnesses. All of them have physical evidence. But most important, these five cases show what it’s like to have an onboard UFO encounter and interact directly with ETs.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF PROFESSOR JOAO DE FREITAS GUIMARAES. On the night of July 16, 1956, Joao de Freitas Guimaraes was taking a walk along the beach in San Sebastiao, Brazil. Sitting down to rest, he was shocked to see a craft emerge from the ocean, fly towards him, and land on the beach. Two human-looking figures wearing jumpsuits emerged and invited him onboard the craft. Inside, Joao was amazed to see how advanced the craft was. Looking out a porthole, he saw the craft zoom into outer space. The ETs warned him about humanity’s savage nature and use of atomic weapons. They promised to meet him again and returned him to the beach. At first Joao kept his experience a secret, but word leaked out to the press and Joao’s story was published widely in newspapers. And soon he would have another encounter.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS OF LYDIA STALNAKER. In 1955, at age 9, Lydia Stalnaker and her two siblings walked near their home in Jacksonville, Florida. Suddenly there was a flash of light and a strange man began to approach. They ran home in fear. Lydia didn’t realize it, but she had been taken onboard a UFO. Later in 1974, Lydia (now age 28) drove outside Jacksonville and saw a UFO land near the highway. She and another man pulled over. They drove together to get a closer look, and suddenly Lydia lost consciousness. When a third missing-time UFO sighting occurred, Lydia sought hypnosis. She learned that she had been taken onboard UFOs three times, meeting grays and other humanoids. They warned her that Earth was facing future catastrophes. Lydia began exhibiting psychic abilities, and before long, was taken onboard again!

THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF JOE, CAROL & LUKE. On the night of June 20, 1976, a couple and their infant son were driving near Goodland, Kansas when they saw multiple UFOs. After watching them and talking about how interesting it might be to be taken onboard, one of the craft swooped over their car. The couple suddenly realized that their car was now five miles further ahead down the road, and they were missing hours of time. They also found strange marks on their body. Later, under hypnosis, they recalled that they were taken onboard by friendly ETs. They were separated and given physical exams. The husband experienced a profound spiritual event. All three were then returned to their car with little memory of the event. Ultimately, they were profoundly changed in a positive way by their encounter.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MYRIAM & SONIA. While driving through Bayamon, Puerto Rico, Myriam X and her mother Sonia were shocked when darkness enveloped them, surrounded by intense light and a period of missing time. Suddenly they were 45 miles away in Arecibo. Myriam and Sonia (both who had been ill) now found themselves miraculously healed. Years later, under hypnosis, they recalled that a UFO had appeared over their car. The craft pulled them and their car into the craft, where they met grays and human-looking ETs. They were separated, given exams, and healed. Both were also given information about the ETs, their agenda on Earth, and much more. They then had a profound reunion with deceased loved ones. They were then returned to their car.

THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF FERNANDO X. One evening in autumn of 1986, a young electrician by the name of Fernando was riding his motorcycle outside of Calleredo, Spain when he saw multiple UFOs overhead. When one of them zoomed towards him, Fernando jumped on his motorcycle to escape. But the engine wouldn’t work. Fernando watched in awe as the UFO floated a few feet off the ground. Two gray aliens emerged and pulled him onboard. Fernando was placed on a table with a bright light overhead, while the ETs examined him. Shortly later he fell asleep, waking up to find himself lying next to his motorcycle. The UFO and ETs were gone, and three hours had passed. Fernando rushed home where he found a strange mark on his body.

These five cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Many researchers believe these cases might number in the millions. These cases provide incontrovertible evidence of onboard UFO encounters. The time has come for truth and transparency on this subject. There are too many cases to ignore; we are being visited by extraterrestrials.

It’s one of the strangest and most fantastic experiences a person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an actual ET. And yet it happens more often than you might think. This video presents ten cases in which people have experienced humanoid encounters. These include all different types of humanoids, from short three-foot-tall childlike ETs, to beings almost fifteen feet tall. These cases come from all over the world. Many of these cases are supported by multiple firsthand eyewitness testimony and a wide variety of physical evidence. Are you ready for contact? Because as these cases show, it can happen when you least expect it.

THE ALIENS IN THE FOREST. It was 7am one morning in the Summer of 1956 as MME L took a walk near her home in Vitry-les-Nogent. She was entering the Marsois Forest, right next to the famous Dolmen Pierre Alot when she saw what she thought were two children. But as she approached, she realized they wore jumpsuits and helmets. They were not human!

UFO LANDS IN DRAKESTOWN. Around 7pm on December 30, 1957, George Chowanski stepped outside his home in Drakestown, NJ to chop some wood. His dog began howling as a buzzing sound filled the air. The sky filled with a glowing light and suddenly a flying saucer landed in his backyard. Out stepped three humanoids who apparently found something of interest in his backyard.

ETS ABDUCT A FIR TREE. One night in 1961, Valborg Agren and her friend Tilda were outside the town of Hallviken, Sweden when they noticed a strange light in the field just off the road. Stopping to investigate, they were amazed to see three short figures holding devices that sent red sparks up the trunk of a fir tree. After watching for several minutes, it slowly dawned on them that these figures were not human.

THE VIOLET-YELLOW GIANTS. In the middle of the night on January 14, 1969, the Vas family of Childers, Australia woke to their dog barking and a buzzing noise outside their home. Going outside, all four family members saw a large craft overhead. Suddenly three giant figures in boxy suits exited and began to pick the plants and take soil samples from their yard. Then one of the figures approached!

OFFICER GEORGE WHEELER AND THE UFO. On the evening of April 6, 1975, police officer George Wheeler of Elmwood, Wisconsin was shocked as a fiery oval UFO flew right over his cruiser. He was so shocked that he hoped to have another encounter. One year later, it happened: he saw a structured craft with a humanoid looking out the window. His life was never the same, especially when people in town began reporting their own encounters.

ANOTHER MICHELIN MAN ET. On the night of March 14, 1976, a couple was driving outside of Valencia, Spain when they noticed a strange glowing object in a field off the roadway. Moments later, they saw a strange humanoid figure which looked like the famous “Michelin Man.” He did not appear to be human as he was floating above the ground. As they passed by him, their car’s electrical system failed.

A FAMILY ENCOUNTER. At 10am on August 6, 1976, Freddy Chiasson, his wife, Claire and their two teenage sons drove through Gaspesie National Park in Quebec, Canada. It was very foggy as they saw a beam of light ahead of them on the road. Next, they saw a craft zoom towards them and land. Going to investigate, they saw two 7-foot-tall humanoids. They fled back to their vehicle and the UFO departed.

THE ETS IN THE GROCERY STORE. On September 10, 1978, three boys were watching TV in their home in Burruyaco, Argentina. Suddenly, their TV stopped working, as did their record player and radio. Then they heard a noise in their father’s store which was attached to the house. Going to investigate, they saw two 3-foot-tall humanoids who had trespassed into the store. 

THE MINIATURE UFO & THE 6-FOOT-TALL ALIEN. On the night of September 15, 1978, following a wave of sightings over Carpentersville, IL, a secretary living in the suburbs was awakened by a loud buzzing noise. Going to investigate, she saw a tall silver-suited figure standing outside her home. Even stranger, she saw a tiny flying saucer (3 feet wide and 2 feet tall) sitting right next to her home. She woke her husband, and they tried to call the police, but their phone wouldn’t work.

THE ETS BY THE LAKE. On August 10, 1979, two witnesses saw a strange object on the lake near Czluchow, Poland. One of them ran to investigate more closely and saw two humanoids float into the forest. Shortly later, he and several other witnesses saw the craft rise and dart away. Two dogs who ran up to the humanoids later suffered a strange illness.

The time for skepticism, ridicule and disbelief is over. How many cases will it take before the world recognizes that we are not alone? The evidence speak for itself. UFOs and extraterrestrials are real!

With so many people stepping forward to share their experiences of extraterrestrial contact, it’s clear that these encounters are far more common than previously believed. It’s difficult to say exactly how common contact is, but some researchers believe it numbers in the millions. This video presents ten cases of contact with humanoid ETs of various kinds, coming from all over the world, from the 1930s through the 1990s. Most of these cases involve extensive interactions with the ETs, including conversations. And of course, physical evidence of many kinds. As these cases show, ET contact is very real.

IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE OLD FRIENDS. One night in 1938, Malcolm B Perry was walking to his home in Somerville, Massachusetts when an odd airborne object caught his eye. It was blimp-shaped with several portholes. Looking down at him through one of the portholes was a humanoid. Malcolm was overcome with a feeling of friendship, and as the craft zoomed off, a sense of loss swept over him.

DON’T LOOK UP! It was a hot day in summer of 1967 as a 16-year-old boy and his brother played outside their home in Langley Prairie, British Columbia, Canada. Without warning, a dome-shaped craft landed nearby and praying mantis ETs emerged. One of the figures approached the witness, speaking telepathically with him. After the beings left, both witnesses were affected both physically and emotionally.

ALL LIFE IS ONE. On May 10, 1957, Shirley McBride drove near Lake Isabella in southern California. Feeling a sudden urge to pull over and admire the scenery, she was fascinated to see a small glowing sphere approach. Moments later, it landed next to her. Inside she saw two humanoids who began to communicate telepathically. Afterward, she forgot the encounter, but later recalled it hypnotically.

THE CURIOUS ALIEN. On August 25, 1958, Mr. Neumann sat in a vacation cabin in Harja, Sweden, reading a book when a feeling of being watched overcame him. Looking at the window, he saw a short humanoid staring at him. Rushing outside to investigate, he chased the figure to a saucer-shaped craft which had landed in a nearby field. The craft took off, leaving behind landing traces.

ALIENS ON ROUTE 7. At 10pm on October 21, 1967, four teenage boys driving along Route 7 in Duncan, Oklahoma were shocked to see three short humanoids floating along the highway in front of them. The figures quickly jumped into a ravine. The boys called the police who believed them but refused to investigate. The next day, the boys returned to the spot and found a strange footprint.

ANOTHER DAM UFO. On the night of December 6, 1978, Jesus Antunes Moreira was in the guardhouse at the Marimbondo Hydroelectric Dam in Frontiera, Brazil when a UFO appeared overhead, then landed on the dam a short distance away. Three human-looking ETs exited the craft and began to speak with Jesus. But when they began to take rocks from the dam area, Jesus protested and the ETs departed.

TRUCKER ENCOUNTER. Just before midnight on December 15, 1978, truckdriver Angelo Capuzzello was driving along Highway 514 near Licodia, Sicily when his radio failed. Pulling over, Angela saw a glowing object just off the road. Shortly later, two humanoids approached and began to converse with him in a strange language. They quickly departed, but afterwards, their footprints could be seen.

DON’T BE SCARED. It was 6:30 pm on August 8, 1951 as RK walked along a path by the resort town of Chalupy, Poland. His walk was interrupted when two weird figures approached. They had large eyes, a slit for a mouth, and wore green jumpsuits. Moments later, he saw a silver disc a short distance away. The beings spoke with RK, and the next thing he knew, 15 minutes had elapsed. He had missing time.

ALIENS AT THE URANIUM FACTORY. On December 12, 1987, retired restauranteur Gerard Lamy went to collect wood near his home in Narbonne France, right next to the Malesi Uranium Factory. To his shock, six child-like figures with Asian eyes and brown skin appeared. They wore dark jumpsuits and stood next to strange-looking scooters. Gerard realized they were actually ETs. The beings then boarded their scooters which levitated off the ground and carried them away.

I WAS PETRIFIED WITH FRIGHT. At 3am on August 31, 1990, Miguel Figueroa drove near Lake Cartagena, Puerto Rico when he came upon a group of people along the highway. They said strange creature were blocking the road ahead. Miguel went to investigate and came upon four gray-skinned figures with large heads and huge eyes. He followed them until they left the road. After the encounter, Miguel was threatened not to speak about his encounter.

These ten cases are just a brief glimpse into the huge number of encounters that have been taking place across the planet. How many cases will it take before our governments disclose the truth and the world recognizes that we are not the only people in this universe?

UFOs are real! The UFO subject is now enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Governments across the world are now admitting the validity of the UFO phenomenon, and more and more people are now stepping forward to share their own encounters. This video presents ten cases of alien visitations from across the world, seven of which involve face-to-face contact with humanoids of all different kinds. Landing traces, physiological effects, unusual electromagnetic disturbances, and most cases with multiple witnesses – the truth can no longer be denied. We are not alone!

A CLOSEUP ENCOUNTER WITH HUMANOIDS. On November 16, 1952, 40-year-old farmer, Nello Ferreri stepped into the fields near his home in Castelfranco, Italy to relieve himself. Suddenly a circle of light appeared on the ground around him, and looking up, he saw a flying saucer hovering just overhead. Looking down at him were three strange humanoids wearing rubber suits.

THREE YOUNG GIRLS SEE A HUMANOID. School had just let out for Anne Storedal (age 10,) her sister Tora and their friend Tora Moy (both age 9) and they were walking to their homes in Torpo, Norway. Suddenly a small black dot appeared in the sky, zoomed down, and hovered only a few feet overhead. The girls could now see it was a strange, spherical craft, and inside was a tiny man dressed in black staring at them.

THE ALIEN TOURISTS. On September 29, 1965, Emil and Ada Carlsson stepped outside their home in Arboga, Sweden and saw a boat-shaped object floating silently only a few hundred feet over their heads. Inside were more than twenty people wearing bright colored clothes. The strange figures were surveying the couple and the environment. The Carlssons realized that they must be alien tourists!

LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS AT WAYNESBORO, VA. On the morning of December 21, 1965, Horace Burns was driving along Hwy 250 near Waynesboro, Virginia when a UFO landed next to him, stalling his car. This was the start of a wave of sightings in the area. One month later and a few miles away, William Blackburn encountered a landed UFO and occupants. A week after that, six young men chased three humanoids again on Hwy 250. Later, one of them and a photographer came upon a landed UFO and alien.

A 13-MILE UFO CHASE. On the evening of January 5, 1971, John Clucas (age 37) was driving to his home, from Penrith to Windsor, Australia. Without warning a glowing object swooped down behind his car and tailgated him. John sped up and so did the object. When he slowed down, the object also slowed down. No matter what John did, he couldn’t outrun the UFO, and it followed him for more than 13 miles.

THE UFO THAT SUCKED. One summer day in 1973, numerous people across England observed a black UFO that moved overhead, sucking various objects into the sky. Several people at Jodrell watched as it levitated hay and grass. A train driver at Kidlington said it levitated a bag of coal. Residents of both Chell and Burslem also saw the UFO and various items being pulled up into the sky. Strangely, nobody reported any wind.

THE UFO MADE HER CRY. On the night of October 13, 1977, Mary Arnett and three others encountered a low-flying metallic disc while driving along Mobley Road in rural Wetzel County, West Virginia. Upon seeing the object, Mary found herself bursting into tears. As the object followed them and started to land, they drove off in fear. They wanted to return to the area the next day to investigate, but they were too afraid.

A BOX-SHAPED UFO WITH HUMANOIDS. It was early morning in November 1978 when 9-year-old Dawn Smith saw a strange box-shaped object floating at low altitude outside her window in Westbank, British Columbia, Canada. She was amazed to see a hatch open and two dark human-looking men standing on either side of the door. Even more amazing was when a large flying saucer emerged from the craft.

THE ODENSE LANDING AND HUMANOIDS. Just before 5am on July 16, 1982, a young man was bicycling to work from Odense, Denmark to Broby, when he came upon a landed UFO. He jumped off his bike and walked up to it, startling five short, bald humanoids who were taking samples and putting them in bags. The ETs retreated to the craft which took off, leaving a circle of crushed grass on the ground.

BADLANDS UFO. One evening in February 1982, geologist Tom Brebol was retiring after surveying the terrain in the wilderness of the Barber County Badlands of southern, Kansas. As a strange silence enveloped the area and Tom had the feeling of being watched, he ventured outside his tent and came upon a landed craft. To his shock, two glowing blue figures appeared. As he snapped a photo, Tom blacked out.

These ten cases from across the planet, spanning several decades, show the incredible diversity and complexity of the UFO phenomenon and the various extraterrestrials visiting our planet. And they have so much to teach us, about ourselves and life beyond Earth.

It was 1968, and 13-year-old Carter Welles walked to school with his best friend, Jackson Groves near his home in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Jackson had just experienced a spontaneous out-of-body experience, and both boys were amazed by the event. Together they vowed to learn how to achieve astral projection. For the next two years they read everything they could find on the subject and meditated daily, but were unable to get out-of-body. Then one evening, Jackson walked home along a remote country highway outside of Toronto when a truckdriver offered him a ride. Jackson accepted. The driver introduced himself as Peter and said, “Well, Jackson, how’s it going with the astral travelling?”

Jackson was shocked because he did not know this man, and Jackson had told nobody but Carter about their attempts to have OBEs. Jackson asked Peter how he knew his name and about the OBEs, and the man just smiled and said, “Oh, you know, we’ve been keeping an eye on you guys.”

After speaking with Peter for an hour or two, Jackson was amazed. Peter showed telepathic abilities, could call forth the wind, and said he worked with extraterrestrials and had been onboard UFOs. He even offered to take Jackson onboard a craft. Jackson was too scared to accept the invitation, but he continued to meet with Peter and learn about spirituality, psychic abilities, and UFOs.

After a few visits with Peter, Jackson told Carter about him. Carter was excited and asked to meet Peter too. Peter agreed, and Carter, Jackson and a couple of friends met with him. Peter repeated that he worked with the aliens, displayed his ability to call forth the wind, read their minds and showed other incredible abilities. The boys hammered him with questions, all of which Peter answered with great wisdom and humor, often bringing the boys to tears with laughter.

Shortly after this visit, the boys were staying at Carter’s parents’ cottage in Rosedale, Ontario. Carter was alone in the house when his friends came running in and announced that they had just seen a Martian at the docks along the nearby Rosedale River
 
Says Carter, “They described it, and it was exactly like what we think of today as a gray. A little guy with a big head, big eyes, a skinny little body. And they saw it. They saw this thing. And we have never experienced anything like that before. So, we were very excited.”

A few days later, Carter and his friends were walking over the Rosedale bridge. Carter got ahead of the others, and looking over the bridge into the parking lot, he saw a strange figure. He knew instantly that it was the “Martian.”

“I saw this little being,” Carter said. “It looked like a little gray alien…and when I first saw it, my body reacted and I kind of jerked. And it mimicked me! And I saw what it did, and I kind of shook my head and looked at it. And it did the same thing. It was kind of playing with me. It was really playful. I had this whole little interaction with it. It was like mimicking me and bouncing around, kind of over-exaggerating my movements. It was very playful. The energy coming off this guy was so fun and playful.”

The met with Peter a few days later and told him what happened. Peter just smiled and showed no surprise. Peter promised to meet them again, but suddenly he disappeared from their lives. All the boys, but especially Carter, were devastated. Peter was like a long-lost friend, or an enlightened Master, and now he was gone.

A few weeks later, Carter and his friends had a dramatic UFO sighting over Rosedale. Then, one of Carter’s friends saw Peter at a fast-food restaurant in Toronto, and tried to get up and talk to him but found himself unable to move until Peter left. 

Carter was profoundly affected by his meetings with Peter. His sense of spirituality became stronger. He began to communicate telepathically with Peter. Carter grew up, searching out the works of spiritual leaders, but none held a candle to what he learned from Peter. Carter traveled the world, and ended up in Hawaii where he built an off-grid home and met his wife. One evening in the middle of the night, the house filled with unexplained white light. Both Carter and his girlfriend had strange memories of being onboard a craft. When they woke up the next morning, they found a strange implant in the same location on their arms.

They moved back to the mainland and continued to have UFO sightings. Carter thought about Peter daily, and often wished that he would see him again one day. But he never did. He looked back on those few incredible meetings with Peter and wondered, who was this man, an angel, a spirit guide, an extraterrestrial? It remains a mystery, but today, now in his late sixties, Carter will never forget how his life changed forever when Peter came into his life.

There is a misconception in the field of ufology that no astronomers have seen UFOs. But the truth is exactly the opposite. In fact, there is a long list of high-profile astronomers who have had incredible UFO sightings. In 1952, Blue Book astronomy expert, J. Allen Hynek held a conference with astronomers. “Over forty astronomers were interviewed,” he said, “of which five had made sightings of one sort or another. This is a higher percentage than among the populace at large.” Researcher Alejandro Rojas, writes “Often people will ask me, ‘If there are so many UFOs, why aren’t astronomers seeing them?’ They are! In fact, astronomers have been some of the most influential advocates for the serious study of UFOs.” This video presents more than a dozen cases of astronomers who have seen UFOs.

In March of 1676, Edmund Halley (the discover of Halley’s comet) observed a “vast body apparently bigger than the moon,” which he estimates was 40 miles high, moving in excess of 9000 mph. He had other sightings of unexplained lights in the sky and on the moon, and on March 6, 1716, saw a strange UFO which remained in the sky for 2 full hours.

In 1783, Sir William Herschel (discover of Uranus and several moons) observed several unexplained lights on the moon. And again on October 2, 1790, he saw more unexplained lights. On several occasions he reported seeing UFOs in the sky which he described variously as, “round…oval…and disc-shaped.”

On April 12, 1879, astronomer Henry Harrison observed a strange object in the skies over New York City which remained in view for three hours. Unknown to him, another astronomer Spencer J. Devoe saw the same object. Researcher Morris K Jessup triangulated the two observations and calculated that the object was a half-mile wide.

On July 10, 1947, leading astronomer Lincoln Lapaz was driving through New Mexico when he and his family saw an elliptical-shaped object high in the clouds. He estimated that the object was 160 feet long, 65 feet wide. It was silent and appeared “self-luminous” against the dark clouds.

On August 20, 1949, Clyde Tombaugh (discoverer of Pluto) was with his family in New Mexico when they all saw a “curious bright object” move across the sky and darting off. Says Tombaugh, “This remarkably sudden ascent thoroughly convinced me that we were dealing with an absolute novel airborne device.”

On February 16, 1950, Dr Charles Shane of the Lick Observatory in Santa Clara, CA saw a “queer object” which he said was “moving unusually swiftly.” He said, “I call this celestial phenomenon one of the most unusual objects sighted in the sky for a long time.”

On May 20, 1950, Seymour Hess was at Lowell Observatory in Arizona when he saw a glowing and “extremely prominent” object move at 200 miles per hour across the sky and into a cloudbank, against the wind. He estimates the object was about five feet wide.

On August 3, 1951, Walter Webb of Hayden Planetarium in Boston, Massachusetts saw a glowing object move across the sky in a weird wave-like pattern. Says Webb, “No known object I could think of followed a path like that…my UFO appeared to be a bright, glowing object moving in a regular, wavy pattern.”

On January 25, 1954, astronomer Robert D Schaldach described his observation of a “yellow-white” pulsating light move across the sky at White Sands, New Mexico. Another military officer observed the object. They reported it to Project Blue Book saying that the object “was not any kind of meteor.” Blue Book did no investigation, but called the object “astronomical…meteor.”

On June 11, 1954, Percy Wilkins was flying over the east coast of the US when he saw two objects that “looked exactly like polished metal plates reflecting in the sunlight.” He concluded that the objects were likely "built, piloted, and controlled by intelligences that surpass that of humans.”

On November 1, 1955, Frank Halstead of Darling Observatory in Duluth, Minnesota was on a train with his wife in Death Valley, California when they observed two UFOs. Says Halstead, “both objects were very shiny, we noticed. But this second one was definitely disc-shaped… The time is long overdue for accepting the presence of these things.”

Jacques Vallee needs no introduction and is a towering figure in the UFO field. In 1961, he was at the Paris Observatory in France and tracked an unexplained object. Says Vallee, “I thought, here we are at a renowned institution seeing something we can’t explain, and destroying data for fear of ridicule.”

As can be seen astronomers all across the world have been seeing UFOs for a very long time. Even Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb says, “UFOs should be the subject of mainstream inquiry. Science must bring clarity.” The time for skepticism is over. The evidence for UFOs is conclusive. We are not alone!

UFO encounters are by their very nature, unusual, but some cases are weirder than others. This is especially true with close-up encounters with humanoids. UFO contact is so much more than just being picked up and examined. UFOs and ETs interact with people in many strange ways. This video presents ten cases from all over the world involving humanoid encounters with high strangeness. Cases from the 1950s to the 2000s. Cases with compelling physical evidence. Cases that have much to teach us about the ET agenda.

IF THERE ARE ANY MORE WARS. On Aug 30, 1955, 21-year-old David Ankenbrandt drove near his home in Mulberry Corners, Ohio when a UFO landed nearby. Going to investigate, he was confronted by a human-looking ET who had an urgent mission for David. When David explained that he was unable to perform this mission, the ETs insisted. Two days later, they returned.

THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD. On the evening of Sep 25, 1957, Sam Aellig and his wife were shocked when a UFO hovered over their home in Alliance, Ohio. Suddenly, a dozen 7-foot-tall ETs walked out of the cornfield and stood in front of their home. One of the beings began to approach. Mrs. Aellig hid under the bed with their baby while Sam stood guard at the front door to see what would happen next.

AN ALIEN IN THE ANTARCTIC. On Dec 11, 1958, AQ1 Navy officer Roger D. Benson was transporting waste from the base at McMurdo Sound in Antarctica when he came upon a landed UFO. Beneath it stood a short humanoid with a huge head. Realizing he was seeing something unusual, he radioed the base in a panic. His message was never received. Unknown to him, the base was being plagued by UFO activity.

THE GIANT ON THE BEACH. One evening in Sep 1961, PHD student Stan Suban was taking a walk along the beach near Fort Tilden, New York when he noticed a group of very tall skin divers standing in a row on the beach. Then he saw a 7-foot-tall figure even more close-by and realized with a shock that it wasn’t human. He hid and watched for several minutes, but fled the scene in fear.

ALIENS IN THE BACKYARD. On the evening of Aug 28, 1963, 12-year-old Fernando Sagrada, his brother Ronaldo (9,) and their friend Jose (9,) were stunned to see a UFO hovering over their backyard. Inside they saw four tall humanoids. Suddenly one came down in a beam of light and approached the boys. Fernando tried to throw a brick at the figure, but it struck him with a beam of light. The figure spoke and then returned to the craft.

THE SJAELLANDS ODDE UFO & HUMANOIDS. On Jan 18, 1967, three boys saw a UFO moving overhead near their homes in Sjaellands Odde, Denmark. Two ran home, but 7-year-old Jesper Andersen stayed and observed eight very short humanoids emerge from the bottom of the craft in a little gondola. They moved closer to him, then waved and smiled at him before moving off.

THE ALIENS IN THE WINDOW. Around dusk on Apr 18, 1971, engaged couple Dennis D. and Marion L. were driving on the outskirts of rural Evans City, Pennsylvania when Marion saw a UFO with and two 10-foot-tall humanoids peering out one of the portholes. They drove closer and came upon the craft landed in a field. They watched it for twenty minutes, then decided it was best if they departed the area.

THE ALIEN ON THE HAM RADIO. On the evening of Aug 12, 1976, David L Dobbs was monitoring his ham radio as he drove outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. Suddenly an odd melodious voice came on the radio and instructed him to drive to a certain location. Upon arriving, David was confronted by a strange humanoid who linked up with him telepathically and downloaded volumes of information into his mind.

WHY DO YOU HATE? On the evening of Nov 1, 1980, an anonymous police officer was on routine patrol near Lucky Point, Indiana, an area of known UFO activity. Looking up, he saw a triangular craft at low altitude. Through one of the windows, he saw five big-headed humanoids. Then he heard a telepathic voice asking him, “Why do you hate?” The officer was shocked and had a quick response to the question.

UFO IN THE SUBURBS. Around 2am on Feb 29, 2008, an anonymous man was walking home in the small but crowded suburb of Coogee, in Sydney Australia when he saw something he could hardly believe, a car-sized levitating sphere with a short humanoid looking out at him. The witness hid in fear, watched for five minutes as the craft flew away. Afterwards, a discolored spot was easily visible on the road.

These ten cases reveal UFOs and ETs that behave in very unusual ways. And yet, they are just a tiny sampling of the huge number of cases. With so many cases from all over the world, coming from multiple witnesses, stretching back decades to the current day, supported by various forms of evidence, the time for ridicule and disbelief is over. We are being visited by extraterrestrials. We have much to learn from  cases like these.

Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the UFO phenomenon is when people have direct face-to-face contact with humanoids. Sightings are undeniably interesting and add to our knowledge of the subject. But humanoid encounters are so close-up that they allow little chance for misperception. They also contain a lot more information. There are far more cases than most people realize. This video presents ten cases from across the world involving direct contact with humanoids of all kinds.

THE HUMAN ETS. On the morning of Jul 20, 1965, milkman Ramon Eduardo Pereyra was making deliveries in Quilmes, Argentina when he saw a strange craft land nearby. He exited his vehicle and hiked to the location. To his shock, he came upon a small craft with a man inside. Suddenly another man approached, ignored Ramon, entered the craft, which promptly took off.

THE INVASION OF AVEYRON. Starting around Jun of 1966, residents of a farmhouse in Aveyron, France began seeing glowing white spheres on their property. They also saw a tall cylindrical object landed nearby. The encounters continued, and on Jan 11, 1967, one member of the family chased a white sphere in his car, and came upon the cylindrical object which took off. Then he saw a saucer-shaped craft with two humanoids inside. The encounter affected him profoundly.

THE LITTLE GREEN SPACE PENGUINS. On the morning of Feb 14, 1967, Claude Edwards woke up to feed the cows on his farm in Tuscumbia, MO when he saw a saucer-shaped craft landed a short distance away. Small gray-green figures scurried around beneath it. As he approached, they went inside the craft. He threw a couple of rocks at it, but they hit some kind of forcefield. Shortly later, the craft took off, leaving behind strange landing traces.

THEY WERE NOT BEINGS LIKE US. On the evening of Apr 16, 1974, Mauro Bellingeri and his wife, Carla, were returning to their home in Casale, Italy when a saucer swooped down and hovered over their car. Looking up, they were amazed to see three or four humanoids in an illuminated transparent dome on top of the craft. When the figures turned to look at them, Carla fled in fear. Mauro watched as the UFO suddenly took off at high speed.

THE ALIENS IN THE ROAD. Trucker Maximiliano of Salamanca Spain never believed in UFOs. But all that changed on the night of Mar 21, 1974 when he came upon a landed UFO blocking the road. Another hovered overhead. As he watched, two humanoids emerged and pointed at him, then returned to their craft, which took off. He drove off in a panic. The next night he had another encounter along the same stretch of road. This time, the humanoids chased him.

ALIENS ON TOP OF THE HOSPITAL. On the night of May 7, 1974, Margaret K Roffe (a nurse’s aid) stepped out of the Veteran’s Hospital in Coatesville, PA where she worked when she saw a small silver saucer landing on the roof of the hospital. Next, three bald, big-headed, gray figures emerged. One looked down at her, and seeing her, they scrambled back into their craft, which took off at high speed.

THEY WERE LOOKING AT ME. On the evening of Feb 24, 1977, friends Lothar Schafler and Rudi Grutsch observed two glowing craft at Langenargen, Germany. The craft disappeared, but when they returned home, the UFOs came back, now much closer. Rudi was inside his home, but Lothar was outside when the craft shone down a beam of light. Suddenly he saw two small humanoids right next to him. He panicked and broke a window to get inside. He thinks he had missing time.

THE ALIEN IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT. One night in May 1977, an anonymous man was fishing along the Amose River in Amosen, Denmark when a saucer-shaped craft zoomed toward him and hovered overhead. He was amazed to see humanoid figures looking down at him. Then the craft sent down a cone-shaped beam of light, and the witness observed another humanoid in the beam. 

THREE DARK FIGURES. While driving home from the hospital in Temperanceville, VA, Marlene LaRose (a nurse) came upon a hovering craft along a remote highway near her home. Looking up, she saw three humanoid figures looking down at her. The craft was close enough that her headlights shone directly on it. She watched it for seven minutes after which it moved forward over her car and off into the distance.

THE JOSZA UFO LANDINGS. Throughout 1986, many people driving along a small stretch of road outside of Josza, Hungary reported seeing UFOs, being followed, and watching UFOs land in the fields. Then, on Jan 9, 1987, a highway worker came upon a landed craft and three short humanoids. One stood in a doorway, while the other two stood beneath the craft. The witness fled in fear. Meanwhile, the encounters continued.

These ten cases represent just a tiny fraction of the actual number of humanoid encounters taking place across our planet. With so many reported cases, it is undeniable that Earth is being visited by ETs of all kinds. It’s time for humanity to wake up to the fact that we are not alone.

ETs have been visiting humans for a very long time. Cases reach back hundreds of years and come from all over the world. Here is a collection of twelve accounts of humanoids of all different kinds from 1922 to 2023. Most of the cases involve multiple witnesses. Several involve physical evidence. The truth can no longer be denied. Earth appears to be just one countless inhabited planets in our universe. The evidence speaks for itself.

TWENTY ALIENS. In the summer of 1922, Irma Hinz and her boyfriend William O’Brien were walking home from a movie in Detroit, MI when they saw a disc-shaped object descend to treetop level and hover over a nearby tree. Staring down at them through a series of portholes were at least twenty bald figures with close-set eyes.

UFO LANDS FOR REPAIRS. In the summer of 1933, three people drove to Tobin Lake in Nipawan, Saskatchewan, Canada to investigate the strange lights people had been seeing in the area. To their shock, they came upon a landed craft and a dozen humanoid figures. The humanoids appeared to be working on repairing the craft.

AN UNINVITED GUEST. As investigated by researcher Klas Svahn, on the night of May 18, 1946, beekeeper, Gosta Carlsson came upon a landed UFO outside of Skalderviksstranden, Sweden. Several male and female human-looking figures surrounded the craft. Gosta approached as close as he could, and watched until they returned inside and the craft departed. Later, he experienced telepathic contact with the ETs.

THE LAUGHING ALIEN. On the afternoon of Aug 14, 1951, a farmer approached a cemetery near his home town of Voghenza, Italy and saw a landed craft and six 4-foot-tall humanoids standing next to it. They wore shiny white jumpsuits and fishbowl helmets, and had monkey-like faces. One of them shot him with a ray of light. They then retreated into the craft, which took off, leaving behind strange landing traces.

THE GLOWING GREEN MEN. It was a stormy night in 1965, as a young couple drove their car along the A6 highway in Cumbria, England. Pulling over to rest, they noticed a glowing red dome-shaped object landed behind a brick wall. Standing in front of the wall were three humanoids glowing with a weird green color. They sped away in a panic.

A BIGFOOT-UFO ENCOUNTER. Around 10am, on Feb 22, 1976, the Hegele family was driving along Interstate 15 outside of Great Falls, Montana when they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid next to the highway. The father, Leonard Hegele stopped the car and pursued the creature, Then he saw a strange craft behind the creature. Soon other reports came in of Bigfoot-like creatures in the area.

THE ROBOT AND THE MONK. On the afternoon of Jul 11, 1978, two young boys were climbing trees near their homes in Ibiza, Spain when they were chased by a robot-like humanoid. Fleeing the area, they saw another strange humanoid wearing monk’s robes. They also saw a landed saucer. But then it released a blue orb which came at them. They ran home, with the blue orb following them most of the way.

HE WAS NOT HUMAN. On the night of Feb 13, 1980, a farmer went to check on his new farm-field outside of Rafaela, Argentina. As a strange silence settled around him, he saw a tall humanoid dressed in a white astronaut suit using a hose-like device to draw water from the river. The figure floated towards him, and moved through a thick hedge of thorn bushes. The bushes seemed to part before the figure.

THE CHILD-LIKE ETS. At noon on Dec 12, 1997, Janko Vrancic came upon a landed UFO and child-like humanoids in a field next to his farm outside Sibenik, Croatia. Having heard about aliens on TV, he approached them and offered them some of his lunch. They told him they weren’t hungry, then climbed into their craft, which quickly departed.

THE UFO IN THE BLACK CLOUD. On Sep 28, 2008, newlyweds Jim and Linda were enjoying a walk along the beach at Perdido Key, FL. Looking up, they noticed a weird black cloud accelerating towards them. Then it stopped about 150 feet overhead and began to light up. A craft appeared in the cloud, and in one of the portholes, he saw an alien staring down at him.

THE SKINNY GRAY. On the night of Jun 6, 2018, four people were in the woods outside of Siletz, OR. Suddenly one of them, a 12-year-old girl saw a skinny little gray staring at her from 100 feet away. She called out to the others, who didn’t see it. But over the next few minutes, it appeared two more times, but only to the girl.

A STARING CONTEST WITH AN ET. Around 4am on Jun 1, 2023, two garbage men were on their route near Mifflin, OH when they saw a tall, thin, gray-skinned skinny figure with large dark eyes staring at them from the woods a short distance away. One of the men walked towards it, and the figure bounded off into the trees and disappeared.

These cases are just a tiny sample of the huge number of humanoid cases on record. There are too many cases to ignore. ETs are visiting our planet.

Face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials onboard a UFO! There’s no experience quite like it. It’s the ultimate UFO encounter. An onboard experience takes a person right into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon, answering many of the questions surrounding this subject. And there are so many cases! This video presents five strange and fascinating accounts of people who were taken onboard an ET craft and met extraterrestrials face-to-face. Want to know the ET agenda on our planet? The answers are here!

LORD MOUNTBATTEN’S BRICKLAYER. On Feb 23, 1956, Frederick S Briggs, a former Army officer, was riding his bike on the estate of Lord Mountbatten of Burma in Romsey, England when he saw a flying saucer hovering overhead. He found himself unable to move as a platform holding a human-looking figure descended from the bottom of the craft. Upon reaching the ground, the ET apparently saw Frederick, and the platform retracted back into the craft, which flew off. But the next day, the ET was back. And this time, Frederick had a face-to-face meeting, and was taken onboard the craft. Frederick says the craft took him on a trip around the world before returning him to the Mountbatten’s estate. It was an encounter he would keep secret for a long time.

THE UFO PROPHET. Born in 1898 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Benjamin Solari Parravicini displayed psychic talents from an early age. He told his parents that he was having contact with angels, fairies and other supernatural beings. He grew up to become a talented artist, and began to make prophetic drawings predicting many momentous world events. His predictions turned out to be uncannily accurate, and his fame grew quickly. Then, on the evening of Jun 4, 1968, a few months before his 70th birthday, Benjamin was walking through downtown Buenos Aires when he met a human-looking ET who took him onboard a craft, which proceeded to circle the planet. The ETs told Benjamin that they were protecting the world from catastrophe, and that it was important that he preach love to all humanity.

TAKEN ONBOARD. Jan Wolski was a simple farmer from the small village of Emilcin, Poland when, on the morning of May 19, 1978, two short, green-skinned figures in dark jumpsuits jumped on his horse-drawn wagon and led him to a UFO. Jan was invited onboard where he underwent a physical exam. The ETs were kind and gentle, he said, and they offered Jan some strange alien food, but he declined. While onboard, he noticed a small group of crows which the ETs had evidently collected from Earth. After the short meeting, Jan was returned to his wagon. He rushed home and told his family. News of his encounter spread fast, and soon others in town reported that they too had seen the craft. Investigators arrived and after investigating the case, declared it genuine. It soon became one of Poland’s most famous UFO cases.

THEY NEED ME. Mark James of Stone Mountain, Georgia was 18-years old when, on the night of Jun 23, 1981, he had his first encounter with gray aliens. He and his girlfriend, Linda, had pulled off the road in a rural area when a brilliant light appeared overhead, followed by a period of missing time. Years later, under hypnosis, Mark recalled that he and Linda were pulled onboard the craft. Mark was taken to a large round room where he saw dozens of other people, some waiting in little booths, while others were placed on tables being examined by grays. Soon Mark was examined, and afterward, a tall gray he described as kind and loving warned him of future catastrophes, such as a disease called Ebola, and a possible nuclear attack on the city of Atlanta. He was also shown his future wife and child. Mark was then returned with Linda back to his car with almost no memory of the event. Soon, more encounters would occur.

I COULDN’T GET OUT. On the evening of June 14, 1986, Bete Rodrigues and her cousin Debora were returning from a dance club near their home in Sao Paolo, Brazil when a UFO began to pace their bus. It darted away, but as the two walked home, the UFO returned, following them. By the time they arrived home, the two had experienced a period of missing time. Afterwards, they had dreams and flashbacks of being examined by ETs onboard a craft. Five years later, they sought hypnosis and learned that both had been pulled onboard a craft. They were taken into different rooms where both underwent a strange physical examination. Bete believes she was implanted by the ETs. Bete also recalled other encounters from her childhood.

These five amazing onboard UFO encounters reveal the many ET agendas, such as studying human physiology, providing warnings about our future, and informing people about the ET presence on our planet. These cases show that there is a wide variety of ET types, and that an encounter can occur to anyone, anywhere, anytime. The truth can no longer be denied. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

In the presence of extraterrestrials! There is no experience quite like it. Seeing a UFO is interesting, but having a face-to-face interaction with an ET brings things to a whole new level. And it happens more often than you might think. This video presents ten extensive encounters in which people have been in the presence of ETs. These cases come from all over the world, involve a wide variety of witnesses and span six decades. Many have multiple witnesses and physical evidence.

A UFO LIKE A SILVER BULLET. One day in Aug 1956, a young boy, “CS,” played football with his friends in Badajoz, Spain. Suddenly a loud roar filled the sky, and looking up, they saw a silver, bullet-shaped object zoom towards them at fantastic acceleration, slow down, and then stop. And inside they saw two figures. About 30 people ran forward, gesturing for the UFO to land. The ETs waved back, but then flew away.

US OR THEM? One evening in autumn of 1965, Keith Meiers (a farmer) looked out the window of his farmhouse in Ross, ND and saw a landed flying saucer in his field. Inside, through a transparent dome, he saw two human-looking figures. He used the telescope on his rifle to get a closer look, until the craft silently departed. The next day, he went to the spot and saw three depressions in the field. Was it alien or military?

YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW THE WORLD. On Jul 2, 1968, Oscar Iriart (age 14) was horseback riding near his home in Sierra Chica, Argentina when he saw two odd-looking human figures. A small flying saucer sat on the ground behind them. They told Oscar that later they would take him for a ride. They gave him a note and returned to their craft, which took off, leaving three holes in the field. Later that night, the UFO returned.

EVERYTHING IS GOD. One night in Jul 1968, Walter Rizzi was driving through the Dolomite Mountains of Italy when he came upon a landed craft. Walking up to it, he saw a short humanoid figure who held a long conversation with Walter about their craft, themselves, their home-world, their agenda, the meaning of God, and even future Earth prophecies. Walter begged them to take him with them, but they refused.

HUMANOIDS IN THE TIJUCA FOREST. In Aug 24, 1974, Regina Conceiacao and four friends stood in front of a home in Alto da Boa Vista, Brazil. Suddenly, they saw two figures, clad in shimmering golden space suits, floating two feet above the road and moving towards them. They fled in fear. Only days earlier, numerous people had seen floating humanoids in the Tijuca Forest which surrounds the area.

“I CAN’T GET IT OUT OF MY MIND” One night in Jul 1975, Frank Slotta and his family drove near their home in Edgewater, British Columbia, Canada and saw a strange light hovering by the road. Later, Frank, now alone, returned along the same road and saw the light again, only this time he saw it was a craft, with occupants visible inside. He became entranced. The next thing he knew, almost two hours had passed.

I DIDN’T DARE SAY ANYTHING. As 10-year-old Jean-Claude Silvente returned to his home in Domene, France on the night of Jan 5, 1976, he was shocked to see a dome-shaped craft land next to him. A door opened and out stepped a tall, blond-haired human-looking figure who chased Jean-Claude. He ran home in fear. The next day he saw the figure again. Soon, many people in the area saw UFOs and aliens.
 
I SAW A FIGURE! On the night of Jan 19, 1976, Kay Peterson and Vi Camp stepped out of their home in Heislerville, NJ and saw a huge UFO hovering nearby. They called out the neighbors and all of them watched as the craft moved overhead and stopped. One of the witnesses saw a humanoid inside a clear part of the craft. The craft left, but people all over the area began reporting UFOs, including the police.

THE BRANCEPETH LEPRECHAUN. At 7:10 am, on Jan 2, 1995, Diana Newton drove along the A690 Road in Brancepeth when she noticed a short little man walking alongside the shoulder. Slowing down, she was shocked to see that he was yellow in color and had large dark eyes and no hair. He bobbed along in a strange bouncing gait. Frightened, she took off. Weirdly, the experience left her mind for a full day.

UNABLE TO MOVE. One night in Nov 2008, Segundo Godoy Lopez was working on top of a building in downtown Santiago, Chile when he saw a strange aircraft approach. Next, it came to within 30 feet of him, and he could see two short, bald, gray figures inside staring directly at him. He tried to alert his co-workers but found himself paralyzed. Finally, the UFO moved away. But Segundo would never be the same.

These ten fascinating cases show that there are many types of ETs visiting our planet, and that a close encounter can happen to anyone, perhaps when they least expect it. They show how truly strange a UFO encounter can be, and that being in the presence of ETs is something that affects a person profoundly for the rest of their lives.

It represents the heart of the UFO phenomenon and is the most extensive and interesting of all encounters: close encounters of the fourth kind, cases of people who have been taken onboard a craft. Experiencers like these are far more common than most people realize. They occur all over the world, and can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Cases like these contain the most information about the many different types of extraterrestrials visiting our planet, and answer the many questions surrounding this subject. This video presents five little-known cases of close encounters of the fourth kind, each of which provides a tantalizing glimpse into the high strangeness of UFO contact.

“I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.” On the night of May 15, 1951, “John,” an army officer was walking to his home north of Salzburg, Austria when a strange man wearing a glass helmet approached him. John found himself paralyzed as the man strapped an odd device to John’s chest and floated him into a craft landed nearby. Suddenly, the craft zoomed upwards. John was shocked to watch the Earth recede into the distance. Moments later, a beautiful landscape appeared before him, filled with lush red fields, blue canals, and tall spires. The craft landed at a saucer-port, the being exited, and John saw many other craft around him, some with other humans inside. Moments later, the ET returned. They took off and John was returned to Earth. For decades he told no one. But growing older, he finally decided it was time to talk.

EXAMINED BY ROBOTS. In the early morning hours of Sep 29, 1974, bus-driver Antonio La Rubia was walking to his place of employment in Paciencia, Brazil and came upon a massive craft sitting in a field. Suddenly unable to move, he was dragged onboard the craft by two robotic figures. Onboard, he was surrounded by dozens of the strange beings, who placed him in a glass-like, bell-jar shaped container. They proceeded to show him a series of bizarre images, some involving apparent future events. They took a blood sample and then dropped him off two miles from the original location. Following the encounter, Antonio suffered fever, extreme thirst, loss of appetite, rash, swelling, body pain, nausea, diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. Later it was discovered that another person in the area saw a UFO on the same night.

“I DID NOT DARE TALK ABOUT IT.” At 1:30 am, on Jun 11, 1976, Helene Giuliana was driving home near Bourg-de-Peage, France when her car began to slow down by itself, the engine faltered, then the headlights went out and the car rolled to a stop. Helene was alarmed to see a brilliant glowing object landed on the road ahead. She locked her car-doors and covered her eyes. Suddenly the object was gone. She drove home, only to discover she had arrived two hours later than she should have. Later, she agreed to undergo hypnotic regression, and recalled being taken from her car by short dwarf-like beings who pulled her into the craft, put her on a steel table and examined her. She was returned to her car with no memory of the event.

WHAT WOULD YOU WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BEFORE YOU DIE? In Jun of 1976, Rick A. Hale’s life changed forever. He was 21 years old, and decided to mentally call out for UFO contact. A few days later, while driving along the I-90 Freeway near Indian John Hill, Washington that he pulled off the freeway onto a rural road and saw three strange beings in white suits and helmets. Even though he had been hoping for contact, he panicked and drove off. However, that night he realized he was missing two hours. Years later, under hypnosis, he recalled being taken onboard a craft where he encountered human-looking ETs, grays, and a wolf-like humanoid. He held a long conversation with them which changed the way he viewed everything.

THEY ARE REAL NICE. “Peter,” a 10-year-old from Georgia reports having contact with gray-like beings since age 4 or 5, starting in the mid-1980s. When onboard, Peter reports that he is almost always taken to a library where the ETs have a bunch of books about Earth, the environment and nature.  On a few occasions, he’s given weird ET puzzle-games and the ETs watch while he tries to solve them. Peter’s onboard encounters usually last for an hour or two, but he is almost always returned only minutes after being taken. Peter says his contacts are benevolent and the ETs are very friendly, though his mother, who is also an experiencer, is frightened by her own encounters. Peter believes the ET agenda is all about trying to save the planet from destruction.

These five close encounters of the fourth kind provide a small cross-section of what appears to be hundreds of thousands if not millions of similar encounters taking place all over the world. These cases have both amazing similarities and puzzling, unique elements. But most importantly, they show that we are not alone in this universe, and that ETs show a great interest in the people of Earth and in the planet itself.

It’s a pattern that researchers have recognized long ago: UFOs seem to be attracted to water. Lakes, rivers, oceans…there are many cases where UFOs are seen diving into the water, coming out of it, floating on the surface, and affecting the water in unusual ways. Cases reach back decades and come from all over the world. Some accounts involve UFOs sucking up the water itself! This video presents twelve weird water UFO cases, each of which provides profound insights into UFOs and their strange connection to water.

USO WITH HUMANOIDS. One day in Aug 1914 as William Kiehl and other witnesses saw an odd object floating in Georgian Bay at Lake Ontario, Canada. Shaped like a bell-jar, he saw two humanoids holding a hose, sucking water from the bay. On top of the object were 3 other figures. The UFO departed so quickly that one of the little men clung to the outside of the craft.

“IT WAS WATCHING US.” When three people decided to take the ferry across Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada, in Aug 1952, they were awed to see a weird round boat zoom toward them on the lake. As it arrived, it rose into the air, showing itself to be a UFO. It hung there briefly, then moved back over the lake before darting off.

UFO ORDEAL AT ORADELL. Just before 8pm on Sep 15, 1962, three boys were shocked to see a UFO drop from the sky, plunge into the Oradell Reservoir in New Jersey, and takeoff. Unknown to them, others saw the object. The next night, the UFO was back. Soon, UFOs were being seen nightly, by hundreds of people. The UFO wave would garner national headlines.

THE PEROPAVA RIVER UFO CRASH. On the afternoon of Oct 31, 1963, more than 50 people observed a flying saucer lose control and plunge into the Peropava Rivera in Iguape, Brazil. As the water frothed and bubbled, the Brazilian military arrived and sent divers down to recover the craft. But after two weeks of searching, no evidence of the UFO was ever found.

A UFO FISH STORY? One evening in 1964, a group of fishermen at the Moraleda Channel in Castro, Chile were shocked to see a glowing man walk out of the sea. After staring at them for a few moments, the strange figure walked back into the ocean. They could still see a strange glow under the water. That’s when fish began to fill their nets in unprecedented numbers.

BEYOND MY POWER TO COMPREHEND. On Apr 9, 1970, Max Krauss was taking a walk near his home in Aufhofen, Germany when he saw a 2-foot-wide, transparent sphere with spokes pacing him. The bizarre device hovered over a small stream and began sucking up water through a pipe. Moments later, it departed. As an electrician Max was convinced that he had seen something extraterrestrial.

UFO DISPLAY OVER CHOLLA BAY. On the night of Nov 7, 1971, Albert Formiller walked along the beach at Cholla Bay, Mexico when a saucer-shaped craft appeared and sent down a beam of light nearly a half-mile wide onto the surface of the water. The craft remained for 20 minutes before slowly moving off. Unknown to Albert, many other people saw the strange display.

“MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE.” In Jul 1973, “Masaaki” worked as a night-guard for a lumber company along the coast of Tomokomai, Japan. To his great fear, a UFO dropped down and began sucking water out of the bay. At one point, it moved overhead and was close enough that he could see strange humanoids inside.

USO AT PITYILU ISLAND. One evening in the 1970s, a missionary was staying at tiny Pityilu Island near Papua, New Guinea when a UFO appeared. It hovered for a few moments and then plunged into the shallow reefs offshore. A group of men sent a boat out to investigate, but before they could arrive, the object was gone.

FISHING FOR UFOS. On the evening of Jul 15, 1981, 14-year-old, Carl E. Moore was amazed to see a UFO drop from the sky and float on the water of a small lake in Newberry, SC. As it hit the water, it sent up a cloud of steam. He watched it from 50 feet away, for three minutes before the craft darted away.

“FOLLOW THAT UFO!” One night in August 1981, a group of 5 witnesses driving in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada followed a red, glowing object as it made a controlled descent into Lake Ontario. Going to the shore, they saw two submarine-like objects emerge in the same exact location. Although the witnesses waited for hours, the UFO never emerged.

“THIS WAS REAL SCARY.” When a father and his two sons went fishing off the coast of Seaforth, England, they were awestruck to see a fleet of five UFOs dive into the Mersey Estuary. Shortly later, all five objects emerged from the sea and flew off. Several other witnesses saw the whole thing.

These twelve cases only skim the surface of the huge number of cases involving UFOs and USOs. These cases show that the waters of our planet might be holding vast numbers of extraterrestrial craft, hidden from sight. And they show beyond any reasonable doubt that there is a strange connection between UFOs and water.

Encounters with extraordinary humanoids have occurred across the planet for a long time. They involve all different types of extraterrestrials who interact with a variety of witnesses in strange and unique ways. These cases are among the most fascinating of all UFO encounters. They are not simple sightings, nor are they cases that rely on hypnotic regression. The evidence to support these encounters is more extensive than many people realize with landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, medical effects and more. But most important, they provide a fascinating glimpse into what lies beyond planet Earth.

SMACKED BY AN ALIEN. On Jul 2, 1953, 14-year-old Maximo Munoz Hernaiz was guarding the cows on his family ranch in Villares Del Saz, Spain, when a UFO landed behind him. Three short men came out and spoke to him in a strange language. Then one of the ETs reached out and smacked him on the cheek. The ETs returned to the craft, which took off. Later, strange landing traces were found.

A HAIR-RAISING EXPERIENCE. Around 10am one morning in Jun 1954, a farmer in Bengough, Saskatchewan, Canada heard a strange motor-sound approaching from the air. Looking up, he was shocked to see a flying saucer with a large transparent cockpit, and seated inside were two human-looking men. The craft passed overhead no higher than 20 feet. It turned out, he was not the only witness.

WHY NOT TO FIGHT AN ET. At 2am on Nov 28, 1954, Gustavo Gonzalez and Jose Ponce were driving through Petare, Venezuela when they came upon a glowing spherical-shaped object blocking the road. A small, hairy humanoid approached. Gustavo grabbed the strange being, only to be thrown to the ground. He tried to stab it with his knife. Meanwhile, people all over the area were reporting UFOs.

THE MOUNT AIRY ALIEN. Late one night in Jul 1968, Mrs. Eggers was woken in her home in Mt. Airy, NC by her dog begging to be let inside. Opening the door, she saw a flying saucer hover at low level across the street. Inside it, a strange humanoid looked down at her. The craft stayed for twenty minutes, during which time, there was a local power failure. Afterward, the witness suffered weird medical effects.

WHAT TRUE BEAUTY IS. On the morning of Oct 2, 1968, Toribio Pereira was on a construction job in Lins, Brazil when a dropped from the sky and landed right next to him. Four handsome, human-looking figures wearing robes appeared. One of them struck Toribio with a beam of light while the others examined the surroundings, took soil samples, and departed. Later, Toribio had more encounters, and was apparently healed by the ETs.

THREE ALIENS ON HUDSON BEACH. Late one night in May 1971, an anonymous elderly lady was drinking tea in her home on Hudson’s Beach, in Waluku, New Zealand, and looking out the window, saw three strange figures on the beach. She thought they might be fisherman until they stepped on a silver-strip and were drawn into a reddish ball of light, which promptly soared high into the sky and disappeared.

SOMETHING WASN’T QUITE RIGHT. On the evening of May 3, 1973, Sigrid Karlson was walking her dog outside her home in Mantorp, Sweden, when she saw a red ball of light in the sky. Returning home, she watched it with her son, Robert, from the window. As it came closer, they both were amazed to see that it was a craft with a transparent dome, and inside were two strange humanoids looking at them.

TOUCHED BY AN ALIEN. On Feb 23, 1975, two 7-year-old boys were roller-skating when they saw a UFO fly across the sky and land nearby. They ran up to it as a door opened and a short figure came out. It walked up to one of the boys and touched him on the shoulder. The boys were paralyzed in fear. Finally the ET returned into the craft. The boys ran to tell their parents who also saw the craft as it departed.

COME WITH US ON A JOURNEY. Around 9pm on Jan 27, 1983, Alan was walking to a friend’s house in Bloxwich, England when he saw a UFO overhead. Moments later, two strange human-looking figures wearing gray jumpsuits appeared ahead of him. As he walked up to them, they said, “Come with us on a journey.” When Alan declined, and said he didn’t want to leave his life, they became insistent.

NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. On the night of Feb 18, 1990, a woman was walking with her dog near Korbach, Germany. Suddenly her dog whimpered and refused to move. A large glowing craft landed, and the dog ran away. The woman was struck by a beam of light. Shortly later, two short humanoids walked up to her and told her. “Don’t be afraid.” They ETs spoke to her and then departed.

These ten cases have much to teach us about extraterrestrial contact. They show us that many people all over the world are having these experiences, that contact often contains high levels of strangeness, that ETs come in all shapes and sizes, that a UFO experience can profoundly impact a witness, and much more!

While there are those who are skeptical that UFOs exist, the truth is that the evidence for extraterrestrials is undeniable. Landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, physiological effects…the list goes on. And when cases like these have multiple eyewitness testimonies, the evidence cannot be ignored or explained away. This video presents five exceptional cases with undeniable evidence.

UFO LANDING AT SOUTH HILL, VIRGINIA. On the evening of April 21, 1967, Clifton Crowder was driving along Ferrell Road to his home in South Hill, Virginia when he noticed a shiny silver craft landed on the street in front of him. As he flicked on his high-beams, the craft belched a stream of flames and took off like a bullet straight up. The craft was gone, but left behind was a huge burn-mark on the road, and four evenly spaced holes gouged into the macadam surface. He went straight to the police and reported the incident. Unknown to him, dozens of people in the area were reporting UFOs flying around at treetop level, including police officers and firemen. UFO researchers converged on the case and declared it genuine. Project Blue Book was contacted and they were unable to identify the craft and labeled it unexplained, Case#11677.

UFO LANDS AT IOWA FARM. It was around 10:00 pm on August 6, 1971 when Don Ede looked outside his home in Westgate, Iowa and saw a brilliant flash in the sky, followed by a red-orange object which dropped down into his neighbor’s field. Unknown to Don, Mike Potratz who lived a short distance away also noticed the flash and the strange object. The next morning, both Don and Mike woke up early and went to investigate the farm of John Bantz, where they had seen the object come down. Together, joined by a member of the Bantz family, they found a 10-foot-wide circle of burned vegetation, surrounded by four smaller circles situated evenly around the circumference. Unknown to any of them, two other people were driving near the area two hours before Don and Ede saw the UFO and were chased down the road by an unknown object.

THE COLBY, KANSAS UFO LANDING. At 2:00 am, on August 19, 1972, John I. Calkins woke up to see UFOs swooping down over his home in Gem, Kansas. He immediately called the local police in Colby, Kansas. Patrolman Paul Carter was sent to investigate, but before he could get there, the police officer came upon a landed UFO. He called for backup and his fellow officer, Dennis Brown arrived and watched the craft take-off. He saw that the craft was heading for nearby Oakley, and called their sheriff’s station. They came out and saw the UFO too. Meanwhile, they headed to John Calkins’ home in Gem, and the UFOs were still there. Meanwhile, the Colby police station was flooded with calls. The UFOs flew around all night long. It would be an experience that convinced many people that UFOs are real.

MISSING TIME IN PRINCE GEORGE. At 4:10 am on January 5, 1977, 17-year-old Kirk Alore drove along Hwy 16 outside of Prince George, Canada. He noticed an oncoming car, and at the same time, saw a strange red light zooming towards it. Suddenly, the object approached him, and he realized it was a UFO. His body became numb as his car radio filled with static, his headlights failed and the engine died. The last thing he remembered was seeing the oncoming car come right at him, the UFO overhead, and then slamming on his brakes. He fell unconscious and woke up to find himself sitting in the passenger seat of his car. The other driver woke him up and told Kirk that he himself had also had missing time and woke up outside his car. Kirk was sore for a week, had a persistent headache, and his car battery was dead. Soon he would have more experiences and this time, he had more witnesses.

THE GREENFIELD UFO LANDING. Around 7:00 pm on Nov 8, 1975, Cathy Wilfong and Cindy Bridges were at their farm in Greenfield, Indiana when the power kept mysteriously going off. Two hours later, a huge UFO appeared over their soybean field. Their dog barked wildly and they fled to their house and called the police. When the police arrived, the UFOs had moved off into the distance, but were still visible. Meanwhile, calls flooded into the station from people reporting the UFOs. The next morning, Cathy and Cindy found a 44-foot-wide circle of crushed vegetation, tightly woven and matted together. When they went public with their story, many other witnesses stepped forward to report their own sightings in that area on that night.

These five cases provide compelling, if not conclusive, evidence of UFO reality. Those who remain skeptical of UFOs have simply not done their research. The evidence is there for those who have the courage to examine it. These five cases are just the tiniest percentage of the actual number of cases, the vast majority of which goes completely unreported. The evidence speaks for itself. UFOs are real! We are not alone!

Onboard a UFO! It’s the closest of all UFO encounters. It’s the most extensive, and perhaps the most interesting. It also contains the most information. In cases like these, the witness is not just seeing a UFO, they are inside it, surrounded entirely by the UFO phenomenon. Onboard UFO encounters allow little room for misperception. This video present five amazing onboard UFO experiences. In each of these cases, the witnesses were not only taken inside a UFO, they had long interactive conversations with the ETs themselves. These five cases come from all over the world, span four decades and involve a wide variety of humanoids and compelling physical evidence.

A MESSAGE TO HUMANITY. On the night of Apr 10, 1962, Mario Zuccala was walking to his home in San Casciano, Italy when he felt a blast of air behind him. Turning around he saw a 32-foot-wide flying saucer land nearby. Out stepped two short humanoid figures covered from head to toe in shiny metallic suits. They grabbed Mario and pulled him onboard the craft. Inside, he saw nothing but bright light. The ETs told him that they have a message for all humanity, which they will give to him later. Mario later had further encounters, but never revealed what the ETs told him.

“WE ARE HERE TO HELP.” On the evening of Jun 23, 1967, Paulo Coutinho (age 17) was walking home from school in Aricanduva, Brazil when a glowing orb dropped fell the sky and landed in front of him. The orb dimmed to reveal a 3-foot-tall humanoid who pulled Paulo into the sky and up into a huge craft. Inside, Paulo was examined by ETs and held a long conversation. They told him that no harm would come to him, that they were visiting Earth to help, that God is real, that humanity needs to become peaceful before they can show themselves, and much more. Returned to his home, Paulo learned that he had been missing for 20 hours. Following the encounter, his stuttering problem disappeared. He also learned that his mother had seen a UFO on the day Paulo was born.

“YOU ARE PROGRESSING AS PLANNED.” At 11:45 pm on Feb 10, 1981, Kathy (a medical professional) was driving to her home in Renton, WA when a glowing craft appeared above her car. Alarmed, she drove the short distance to her apartment, only to find that the UFO had followed her home. She ran to her front door, only to discover that she had missing time. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard a craft and examined by gray aliens who told her that she was doing well, that they were pleased with how her father had taught her, and that they would meet again. She told her father what happened. He wept and told her that he had been taken three times by the same ETs.

“YOU ARE TOO OLD.” In the early morning hours of Aug 12, 1983, 77-year-old gardener, Alfred Burtoo set out for a fishing trip along the banks of a canal in Aldershot, England. To his shock, a UFO landed nearby, and out came two 4-foot-tall humanoids dressed in shiny green suits and helmets. They walked up to him and gestured for him to follow them onboard their craft. Inside, Alfred saw rounded walls, a central column, and a strange beam of light. They instructed him to stand under the light so they could examine him. Afterwards they turned to him and said, “You can go. You are too old and infirm for our purpose.” Mildly disappointed at being rejected by the ETs, Alfred exited the craft, which promptly took off. Alfred later called it the greatest experience of his life.

“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.” One night in the 1990s, Sharon Beals was in her home in the USA when she saw odd lights through the skylight. At the same time, her 2-year-old daughter, Kelly (who had been complaining of monsters and “sky monkeys” entering her room) came running in. Without warning, both woke up to realize that hours had passed. Sharon discovered that her eyeglasses were bent so badly, they were now useless. Knowing she had been taken again, she went under hypnosis and recalled being taken onboard a craft. Inside she saw gray ETs who told her that they were her friends, that she was safe, and did she want to help save the planet? Sharon saw her daughter and several other people onboard the craft before being transported through the ceiling of her home and into her bedroom.

These five cases are just a tiny fraction of the actual number of onboard encounters, and yet they provide an accurate representation of what it’s like to be taken into an alien craft and interact directly with extraterrestrials. They contain both unique elements and fascinating commonalities. They answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon, and also provide compelling evidence for UFO reality. They show how complex and bizarre UFO contact can be, and how it is both transformative and enlightening to those who have the experience. And most importantly, they make it very clear that humanity is not alone in this amazing and infinite universe.

Each UFO case, whether a simple sighting or an onboard UFO encounter, adds to our knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and provides another piece to solving the UFO mystery. One of the most fascinating aspects of UFOs is that they behave in weird ways. This video presents 12 very strange encounters that show the high strangeness of ET contact. The cases come from all over the world and provide strong evidence of UFO reality.

“IT SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTED TO DO.” Aug 20, 1955 was a windy day as two men stood on the dock of Kenora Bay in Ontario, Canada. Suddenly, a saucer zoomed over the water, seeming to study the men. But then it moved to the nearby hospital, and seemed to inspect that, before suddenly darting away.

THE UFO THAT LISTENED. On Sep 3, 1955, Frank Flaig and his wife Ruth drove along Boomer Rd in Cincinnati, OH, when a small silver sphere descended to the ground. Frank stopped the car and went over to investigate. But his wife Ruth became concerned for his safety and called out to him. Amazingly, the UFO seemed to react to her voice and darted off.

THE THIRSTY UFO. In Jul 1965, John Hambling was working with another man in the wilderness north of Hazelton, Canada when they saw a UFO swoop down over a small alpine lake. The craft sent a cylinder down to the surface and began to suck up the water. They were able to take several photos before the craft darted off. Was it there for the water? Or was there another reason?

“WE WANT TO WATCH FLYING SAUCERS.” One night in Aug 1967, 12-year-old, Leif told his parents that he and his friends were camping in the front yard of their home in Duncan, Canada, to watch for flying saucers. His parents were amused. But later, Leif rushed to the window to announce that the UFOs had arrived. His parents rushed outside and saw the UFOs themselves.

UFO INSPECTS FARMHOUSE. On Feb 19, 1968, Martha Heggs was alone with her two children in her farmhouse in Bengough, Canada when she heard a piercing noise. Looking outside, she saw a flying saucer hovering over the power-pole. As her dog cowered in fear and the cows ran for safety, the saucer closely inspected each area of the farm. It was the strangest 20 minutes of Martha’s life.

UFO LANDS AT WASHINGTON DC. At 6am on Oct 24, 1968, a paperboy was making his rounds in Bethesda, Maryland when he saw a landed UFO in Fort Bayard Park, along the border of Washington DC. He watched it for about three minutes when it suddenly flew away, leaving a burnt circle of grass. The case would soon generate interest at high levels of govt.

PANIC AT THE POOL. In Oct of 1968, tourists were enjoying themselves in the pool at Sulphur Mountain Resort in Banff, Canada. Suddenly, a UFO appeared over nearby Mt Rundle and everyone stopped to watch. Then the UFO swooped down at high speed beside the pool, causing complete panic. Some people were injured and a few went into clinical shock.

SPEEDWAY DRIVER’S ORDEAL BY UFO. Early on Apr 13, 1971, racecar driver, Geoff Richards and his wife drove along a remote highway outside of Brunswick, West Australia when a UFO swooped down and buzzed their car. But then it returned and zoomed towards their car, playing a game of chicken, not once or twice but several times.

THE 15-TON CRAFT. One night in May 1971, Angela Rajh saw an odd glow near her home in Stara Cerkev, Yugoslavia. Going to investigate, she saw that the glow was a landed flying saucer. She raced home, only to learn that her mother saw the UFO. Also, her neighbors saw the craft on the ground and walked up to it. Later they found some very odd landing traces.

UFO BLOCKADE ON MPUSHINI BRIDGE. On the evening of July 22, 1972, two gentlemen were driving through Ashburton, South Africa when they came upon a UFO sitting in the middle of the road on the Mpushini Bridge. Unable to pass, they had no choice but to stop. The UFO took off a short time later and they called the police, who saw it too.

UFO TAKES OVER TRUCK. On Jul 18, 1976, the sheriff’s office near Gravel Switch, Kentucky was flooded with calls from people reporting UFOs. The UFO flew around for hours. One lady said it chased her car. But the strangest call came from two witnesses who said the UFO came down over their truck and took control of the vehicle.

MISSING TIME ON THE TOILET. On the night of Mar 13, 1979, Mr. WP went to visit the pub near his home in Alverthorpe, England. Strangely, however, he found himself taking the wrong route. Unexpectedly he came upon a UFO which chased him across the field. Suddenly he found himself standing in the public restroom next to the pub with no idea how he got there.

These twelve cases show how any encounter can provide profound insights into UFO behavior. Only by examining all the cases will we discover the alien agenda and the reasons for the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. And there is no shortage of cases! The truth is coming out. We are being visited.

It’s one of the most mindboggling experiences a person can have: a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial. And yet thousands (if not millions) of people have had this experience. And yet, it is still not fully accepted by mainstream society. Thankfully times are changing as governments across the world begin to acknowledge the ET presence. And yet, they are still discussing only UFO sightings and ignoring the cases of direct contact. This video presents ten amazing cases of landings and humanoid encounters of all kinds. Cases from across the planet, spanning many decades, involving multiple witnesses and a variety of evidence.

A PEACE THAT PASSES ALL UNDERSTANDING. One day in Aug 1944, Mrs. E.M. Church had a day off from her nursing duties at Cashmere Sanatorium in Christchurch, New Zealand. She was hiking in the area when she came upon a landed craft and three odd-looking humanoids. She hoped to speak with them and get a ride! But as she approached, they fled into their craft. The aftereffects were as amazing as the encounter itself.

UFO LANDING WITH HUMANOIDS. On Mar 18, 1950, Wilfredo H. Arevalo was driving near his ranch at Lago Argentino, Argentina, when a craft with a transparent dome landed nearby. Inside, he saw four pale-skinned humans wearing cellophane-like jumpsuits. They shot a beam of light at him, and then took off. The next day, Wilfredo found burned grass where the craft had landed. Also, many people in the area also reported seeing the craft.

THEY WALKED OFF INTO SPACE. On Oct 8, 1968, four people in Asbestos, Canada were puzzled by a greenish glow in the sky. Suddenly a flying saucer emerged from the glow and began to move off. Two of the witnesses followed it as it moved away. But two of the witnesses stayed at their house and were amazed to see humanoid figures exit the craft and walk into empty space.

THE ALIEN IN THE ORCHARD. It was lunchtime in Aug of 1973 for farmhand Edmond Cardoso de Oliveira at a farm in Nova Friburgo, Brazil. To his amazement, he saw a silver, egg-shaped craft landed in the orchard. He walked up to the craft and suddenly a door opened. He found himself face-to-face with a 3-foot-tall humanoid. Edmond fled. He returned with more witnesses, but the craft was gone.

THE THREE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOID. On Oct 19, 1973, a family of three was shocked to see a glowing red UFO hover over their farm in Copeland, NC. The wife screamed and pointed to the ground. Standing before them was a 3-foot-tall humanoid in a golden metallic suit. They fled in their car and refused to return until the next day. They left their dog, but he also ran away and didn’t return until the next day.

ETS FROM A PHONE-BOOTH-SHAPED UFO. On Oct 29, 1976, six boys were playing near a local cemetery in Barakaldo, Spain when they saw a strange object descend into a walled-in field. Two of them ran to investigate and saw the craft on the ground. Out stepped two tall figures. One walked up to the wall, knocked on it, and then pulled out a laser-like device and shot at it. The boys fled in fear.

ETS LIKE TOY SOLDIERS. Around 3:00 am on Dec 31, 1976, Nellie Richardson was awakened in her home in Bignall, England by a loud bang. Looking outside, she saw a huge oval-shaped object hovering in the fields outside her window. It stayed for nearly 40 minutes. As it began to move away, she saw little humanoids inside, moving back and forth. Her son came home just in time to watch the object move off.

ETS VISIT TRANSMITTER STATION. On Oct 18, 1977, Kurt Nilsson was testing out his ham radio by the transmitter station on Hemliden Mountain, Sweden. It strangely malfunctioned, and that’s when he saw a landed UFO and three very short humanoids. He tried to flee, but they aimed a strange device at him and stalled his car. Afterward, more strange events occurred.

THE BABYSITTER & THE ALIEN. In Feb 1981, a 17-year-old girl babysat at her neighbor’s house in Greensburg, PA when a UFO hovered outside. It was close enough that inside, she could see two humanoids with large bald heads and weird eyes operating a strange console. She felt entranced by them, but finally fled inside, when the electronics of the house began to fail.

RUSSIAN ROBOTIC ETS. Around 2:30 pm on Jul 6, 1989, a group of six children watched in shock as a spherical UFO landed near their homes in Kharovsk, Russia. The craft separated and out stepped a tall, robotic-like figure, which walked across the field. Then another UFO landed and another ET came out. This happened a third time! Then a fourth UFO landed. The strangeness had only begun.

These ten cases provide a tantalizing and intriguing glimpse into the subject of extraterrestrial visitation. They represent only the tip of the iceberg of the countless of other encounters that have happened across the planet. There are too many cases to ignore. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not alone!

Each UFO encounter has something new to teach us about the UFO phenomenon, and this is especially true with cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. The twelve cases presented here span many decades and come from across the planet, and yet they show both remarkable commonalities and intriguing unique aspects. So many independent witnesses, so many different kinds of extraterrestrials, so much evidence! And most importantly, so many cases! The truth can no longer be denied!

THE ETS ON THE PLATFORM. On Jul 25, 1938, during a civil war in Guadalajara, Spain, two military officers observed a disc-shaped object descend nearby. To their shock, a platform with two humanoids extended from the craft. Not knowing about UFOs, the men first thought it was a secret Russian military craft. Before long, they would change their minds.

THE CROUCHING ALIEN. It was quitting time on Sep 5, 1954, as 12-year-old John Jacob Swaim finished plowing the wheat-field of his family farm in Coldwater, Kansas. Then he saw a tiny little man staring at him. He ran after the man, who floated to a craft landed nearby. The craft quickly darted away. Afterward, hundreds of tiny footprints were found in the field.

THE PEACEFUL ET. In Jun of 1967, Franjo Friedl was trimming trees in his backyard in Croatia and saw what he first thought was a uniformed soldier. Then the figure approached and Franjo saw that it was a strange 4-foot-tall humanoid. The ET said he wanted to make  contact with Franjo,  and told him to tell no one. The ET ran into a saucer, which flew away.

THREE LITTLE SPACEMEN. One evening in Oct 1967, Donald Marshall was walking to his home in Melford, Saskatchewan, Canada. Behind his home, he saw a strange light, and then saw it was actually a window attached to a craft landed. That’s when he saw three little humanoids running around. They ran into the craft, which took off, breaking off tree branches as it left.

“HEY YOU…ALIENS!” On the night of Apr 26, 1969, David Arychuk took his dog Brandy for a walk by his home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Brandy stopped and look up at a strange craft floating about 20 feet high. David then saw two humanoids standing near the craft. His dog panicked and begged to go home. Upon returning shortly later, the craft was gone.

THE WILLARD UFO WAVE. On the night of Jan 22, 1971, the phones at the police station near Willard, Ohio rang off the hook with callers reporting UFOs. Among the dozens of witnesses was a couple who said the UFO hovered 100 feet over their car. Inside, through a transparent dome, they saw a strange humanoid.

ENCOUNTER CAUSES NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.  Around 4:30 am on Sep 9, 1972, a man observed a low-flying craft near his home in Glasgow, Scotland. Looking down at him from a porthole of the craft, he saw a blond-haired humanoid wearing a silver suit. The man was so traumatized that following the encounter, he suffered a nervous breakdown.

THE TALL SILVER MAN. It was early afternoon on Jul 10, 1975 as the Taylors drove near Ewloe, Clwyd in Wales. To their shock, they saw a 7-foot-tall humanoid wearing a full-body silver jumpsuit picking up things alongside the road. At first they kept their encounter secret. But then other people began to report seeing the same strange being.

EXTRATERRESTRIALS ON MOUNT EVEREST. In 1933, Frank Smythe was climbing Everest when he saw two UFOs hovering overhead. Later, other climbers saw UFOs, including Reinhold Messner and Doug Scott. Jan Scott (Doug’s wife) was at basecamp and said everyone there saw the UFOs. One time, a UFO came so low, she saw figures through a window.

THE INJURED HUMANOID. On the night of Jun 12, 1977, David X stepped outside a hotel in Crystal Lake, Illinois and saw three 4-foot-tall humanoids approach. He first thought they were coming for him. Then he saw another humanoid lying on the ground only a few feet in front of him. That’s when he realized that the ETs were there to rescue their fallen comrade.

ROBOTIC ALIEN AT ATOMIC INSTALLATION. On the night of Mar 18, 1978, Ken Edwards was driving by an atomic installation by his home in Risley, England. He then saw a silver-suited figure with outstretched arms walk into the middle of the road. Ken was struck by a beam of light, which fried his radio. The figure walked through a fence and disappeared. Soon events became even more bizarre.

REPTILIANS OVER ELECTRIC STATION. In the Fall of 1990, a couple drove by an electric power station and saw a strange teardrop-shaped UFO cross the road ahead of them and hover over the station. To their shock, they saw two reptilian humanoids looking down at them through an open-air platform. One of them heard a mental message, “Do not stay here. Go away!”

These 12 humanoid encounters show how bizarre UFO encounters can be, and that we still have much to learn about ET contact and the ET agenda on our planet. Yet they make it very clear that we are not alone, and that we have been visited for a very long time.

Onboard UFO Encounters! These cases are the heart of the UFO phenomenon. Almost everything we know about ET contact comes from the people who have been inside UFOs. These are the most extensive and interesting of all UFO encounters. This video presents five fascinating firsthand cases involving people from across the world who have been onboard a UFO and interacted with aliens.

MUST HAVE WATER! One evening in the Spring of 1951, an anonymous engineer, HM, drove near the Drakenstein Mountain in Paarl, South Africa when a man flagged his car down. “Have you any water?” he asked. HM said no, but agreed to drive the man to a nearby stream and get some water. The man then asked HM to drive back up the road. To HM’s shock, they came upon a landed flying saucer. The man invited HM inside the craft, where he saw four other men. The man said that they needed water to cure an injured companion. They agreed to answer any questions HM might have. HM asked how the ETs power their craft. He asked where they came from, and they pointed to the stars, but refused to be more specific. HM was ushered off the craft. Returning the next day, he was amazed to find weird landing traces.

TAKEN IN ITAPERUNA. On the night of Sep 25, 1971, Paulo Caetano DaSilva was driving through Itaperuna, Brazil when a saucer-shaped craft chased his car down the road. He went to the police station and told them what happened. He then returned on his journey, only to have the saucer land on the road and stall his car. Three little men exited and pulled Paulo onboard where he was examined. Paulo fell unconscious and the next thing he knew, he was being set down next to his car. Paulo was shocked and disoriented, and his eyes were very sore. He went to the police and told them what happened. To his shock, another man, Benedito Miranda, reported an encounter on the same night, and people throughout the area saw UFOs. Little did Paulo know that his encounters had only begun. The ETs would soon return, this time with a profound message.

OWYHEE RIVER ENCOUNTER. One day in the Summer of 1975, a married couple, Darryl and Toni were on vacation near the Owyhee River in Oregon. They stopped by the road when they saw what they thought was a plane in the sky, except it was silent. Upon returning home, they found that they were missing two hours of time. Darryl became very depressed, and Toni noticed an increase in psychic abilities. Knowing something strange had happened to them, they went under hypnosis and recalled being taken onboard a craft. Darryl recalled being examined by short, gray-skinned ETs, who proceeded to heal an old childhood injury to his arm. Toni was told by the ETs that because she was psychic, they would allow her to observe the healing procedure. Afterward, both felt it was a benevolent encounter, and Darryl described the ETs as very loving.

TAKEN ON CRYSTAL MOUNTAIN. At 2:30 pm on Jul 14, 1985, Joseph left the lodge at the Crystal Mountain Ski Resort in Washington State to take a hike up the mountain. No sooner had he left when he suddenly found himself lying face down 2000 feet up the side of the mountain, disoriented, sore, with five unexplained needle-marks on his back. He stumbled back down, met his partner, Cassandra at the lodge and learned that he was missing two hours of time. Wondering what had happened to him, Joseph sought hypnosis and learned that he had been taken onboard a craft. Inside he was shocked to see more than 25 short, grayish-green, humanoid ETs. He was placed on a table and physically examined. He remembered them doing something to his back. He was then placed back on the mountain. Following this, he had two close-up UFO sightings.

TAKEN IN THE YUKON. On the morning of Sep 3, 1987, Kevin Bramm drove his motorbike along a remote highway in Yukon, Canada. Stopping to go pee, he was shocked to see a UFO fly across the road ahead of him. Moments later, he saw two insectoid-looking figures, who struck him with a beam of light. Time seemed to stop, and Kevin had the sensation of being paralyzed and drawn upward. The next thing he knew, it was nearly nighttime. He got on his bike and rushed off. Upon arrival to his trailer, he heard an odd buzzing sound, but was too scared to investigate. But it was then that he remembered being taken onboard a craft with strange instruments and panels, and two gray ETs. They gave him strange liquid so he wouldn’t remember. Kevin wanted to remember, but drank the liquid. Afterward, he found two strange scoop marks on his hands.

These five cases provide a vivid portrayal of what it’s like to be taken onboard a UFO and meet extraterrestrials face-to-face. These cases are supported by multiple witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. They show that ETs are actively engaged in taking people onboard their craft and have been visiting our planet for a very long time.

There's nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial. UFO sightings are interesting, but  these UFOs have occupants inside them, humanoids of all different kinds. This video presents ten extraordinary little-known cases of people who have had close encounters with UFO occupants. These cases span many decades and come from all over the world. They provide compelling evidence of UFO/ET reality. They show what it’s like to have contact with ETs, and also answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon.

THE SAUCER IN THE CELERY FIELD. In Oct of 1928, an 80-year-old lady was checking her celery field of her farm in northern WI and came upon a landed craft. To her shock, she saw several small figures exit the craft and run into the woods. Intrigued, she approached the craft and ventured inside. She was amazed to see little seats, a bunch of food-wafers, but very little equipment. Then officials came and took the craft away.

THE WAVERLY UFO LANDING & HUMANOID. On Aug 13, 1965, David Gibson (age 14,) and his family saw a UFO fly over their home in Waverly, IA. To their amazement, the object descended behind a hill. David ran to investigate, and saw a three-foot-tall bald creature standing nearby. The being ran off into the woods. David then saw the craft dart away. And after some exploring, he found a 20-foot circle of burned grass.

ETS INVESTIGATE EARTHQUAKE. On Jul 31, 1967, an earthquake struck Caracas, Venezuela. Three days later, afraid to be in their damaged home, Juan and Maria Desoto slept in their car. Suddenly a disc-shaped craft appeared overhead, released a smaller craft, and out came a humanoid. It examined the ground, scooping up various stones. They watched it for 15 minutes. The next day, their neighbors said they saw the UFO too.

BALD & BEARDED RED REPTILIAN ALIEN IN A GRAVEYARD. On Aug 29, 1968, a group of boys playing in a graveyard in Coleraine, Quebec, Canada was amazed to see a UFO and a dwarf-like figure. The next day it returned, and more kids saw it. Then, on the third day, the ET and UFO returned, and this time, two adults saw it. On the fourth day, more than 300 people came to see if the UFO and ET would return.

THE THING ON THE STAIRS. On Sep 15, 1968, KBJ (an officer of the British Army) was guarding the Dhekelia Army Barracks on the island of Cyprus. At around 3:00 am, a whining noise filled the room. The guard dog whimpered and hid under the bed. KBJ opened the door and saw a bizarre humanoid with glowing eyes, red hair floating up the stairs. He slammed the door shut and grabbed a gun. 

A UFO LANDED IN MY BACKYARD. One evening in Jan 1969, Adeline Davis woke up to see a landed UFO had in her backyard. She could hardly believe her eyes as she saw a strange human-looking figure staring back at her from inside the craft. For the next 20 minutes, the craft remained. At the time, all the power in the house failed. Finally the craft left, but Adeline would never be the same again.

SUCKED THROUGH THE WINDOW. On Apr 2, 1971, a man from Greenhill, NSW, Australia went to the kitchen to get a drink of water. He saw a strange face staring at him from outside. Suddenly, a strange force gripped him and pulled him through the window. He fell to the ground outside. His wife ran into the kitchen just in time to watch it happen. Unknown them, many people in the area saw UFOs at that time.

THE HUMANOID ON THREE MILE LAKE ROAD. On Oct 9, 1975, Robert Suffern drove down the road to investigate a strange glow behind his barn in Utterson, Ontario, Canada. Instead, he came upon a strange craft landed in the road. It quickly took off, but moments later, as Robert drove back home, a strange humanoid jumped in front his car. He told the police what happened, but regretted this decision.

THE CRACKNECK CREATURE. On Oct 10, 1976, a woman driving with several other cars along a road near Crackneck Lookout in NSW, Australia was puzzled to see the other cars race away. Looking up, she realized a flying saucer was pacing her car. She sped off too. Later that night, two couples at Crackneck Lookout saw a strange 9-foot-tall hairless humanoid with fly-like eyes.

THE ALIENS AT STONEHENGE. On the evening of Nov 18, 1990, a couple (Lee & Dorne) went to visit Stonehenge. Dorne was amazed to see a UFO hovering nearby. Lee strangely refused to look, but then he saw a strange 7-foot tall figure lurking among the stones of the monument. The couple fled in fear. Following the encounter, numerous strange events occurred.

These ten cases provide a cross-section of cases involving direct, firsthand, face-to-face contact with aliens. And yet, they are only the tip of the iceberg. And yet, these cases teach us many things. They show us that ET contact is worldwide, ongoing and is supported by compelling evidence. They also show us what it’s like to meet an ET, and that an encounter can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime.

The UFO phenomenon is one of the most persistent and perplexing mysteries of modern times. While it has become increasingly evident that we are dealing with extraterrestrials, there are still many questions surrounding UFO activity on our planet. Cases of face-to-face contact with ETs remain the heart of the UFO phenomenon, but UFO sightings are far more numerous. This video presents 15 unusual and provocative sightings from across the planet, each of which raises important questions and provides profound insights.

THE MINIATURE UFO. One day in 1932 in Nambour, Australia, a young boy was playing with his friends when he came upon a landed craft only one foot wide. Standing next to it, he felt strange sensations in his body. He retreated from the object, which promptly took off. That night, blisters formed on his hands.

THE FAITH HEALER & THE FLYING SAUCER. In 1950 in Kenya, Africa, a faith healer visited the home of a man whose mother had suffered a stroke which left her paralyzed. While healing the woman, the faith healer told to the man to go outside and look at the sky. The man was shocked to see three UFOs.

THE UFO AT THE BUS-STOP. On May 9, 1956, Gertie Wynn and her friend Joan Frost sat at a bus-stop in Jacksonville, FL when a UFO dropped from the sky and hovered overhead. Both felt certain they were about to be kidnapped by the UFO. Just then, the bus arrived.

DIVE-BOMBED BY A UFO. Around 11pm on Jun 24, 1957, three teenagers were driving near Russellville, IN when they saw a UFO overhead. The next night at the same time and place, the UFO returned. This time, it swooped down and ejected a smaller object which entered their car and exploded.

UFO CAR CHASE. On the night of Mar 13, 1967, Cecil Perkins was in his home in San De Fuca, WA when a man knocked on his door saying that a UFO had chased him down the highway. Looking up, Cecil was amazed to see that the UFO still there.

THE UFO THAT TALKED BACK. On Nov 15, 1967, Alan Poole was driving at Yerecoin, Australia when a UFO landed right next to his car. It was so close, he could barely open the door. Alan shouted at the UFO. To his amazement, the UFO shouted back at him, then took off.

FIREFIGHTING ALIENS. In Jun 1968, southern Morocco was struck by a heatwave which caused more than 16 wildfires. One witness described how he saw a saucer-shaped craft drop down and hover above one of the fires, which immediately became extinguished!

UFO SETS MAN’S HAIR ON FIRE. On Jul 20, 1968, Anders Stenlund stood in his front yard in Norrland, Sweden. Suddenly, a 23-foot-wide saucer swooped over his head. Anders threw himself to the ground in fear. At that point, he felt a blast of heat and smelled something burning. To his shock, it was his hair!

MORSE CODE UFO. On Jun 18, 1971, a family from Ben Lomond, CA was puzzled when the electronics in their house began pulsating in a weird Morse Code-like pattern. Looking outside, they saw a UFO blinking in the same pattern. Not only that, so were the city lights all around them!

THE UFO AND THE FREEZER. On Dec 5, 1973, a family was in their home in La Selva Beach, CA when their freezer alarm went off for no reason. Looking outside, they saw a UFO blinking in rhythm to their freezer alarm.

HARRASSED BY A UFO. After a UFO swooped over a family’s campsite on Jun 18, 1972 in Barstow, CA, they found themselves being followed by the same UFO the next night and forced off the highway. When others stopped to help the family, they also saw the UFO.

WHAT THE UFO DID TO THE GAS STATION. On Jul 31, 1976, Eldon’s Standard Service Station in Council Bluffs, IA suffered a series of bizarre damage to the equipment in the station. Meanwhile, people in the area saw a UFO hovering only 100 feet overhead.

SUSIE’S PUPPIES & THE UFO. On Feb 4, 1978, the Semaza family of Orange, CA was awakened by a UFO buzzing over their home. Meanwhile, their dog, Susie (who had a new litter of puppies) also heard the UFO, and she was not happy. Susie began to hide her pups to protect them from the UFO.

WASHED-UP UFO. On the night of May 29, 1971, a man was walking along Yaquina Beach in Newport, OR when he came upon a strange glowing object that had apparently washed onto the beach from the ocean. He called the police who also saw the object. Before they could investigate, the object disappeared.

ALIEN ALIBI. In 2000, a man was arrested by the Des Moines, IA police for trespassing into a stranger’s home. The man, however, protested his innocence. He said that he had not broken in. He had been 170 miles away when a UFO scooped him up. The next thing he knew, he woke up in the stranger’s house.

These 15 cases show how even a simple sighting can raise more questions than they answer. They show that every encounter is unique and provides an important piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. And most importantly, they make it very clear that we are not alone in this universe.

When UFOs land and people have face-to-face encounters with humanoids or are taken onboard a craft, we find ourselves at the very heart of the UFO phenomenon. While sightings are undeniably fascinating, the answers to the many questions surrounding this subject lie with direct contact. These kinds of cases contain the most data and show us exactly what it’s like to have close interaction with extraterrestrials. This video presents ten cases coming from across the globe, spanning several decades, and involving many different types of humanoids. These cases provide the kind of evidence that cannot be ignored or explained away, including landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, medical effects, animal reactions and more.

ITALY’S FIRST HUMANOID? On Aug 14, 1947, Luigi Rapuzzi Johannis was hiking in the mountains near Raveo, Italy when he came upon a landed saucer-shaped craft. Standing next to it were two of the strangest figures he had ever seen. Attempting to communicate, he found himself being struck by a beam of light and unable to move. The ETs approached him, then retreated into their craft and departed.

A UFO IN TROUBLE. On the evening of Apr 24, 1950, Bruno Facchini stepped outside his home in Varese, Italy to investigate strange flashing lights. To his shock, he came upon a landed craft and human-looking figures who appeared to be trying to repair it. Not yet realizing that these figures were ETs, he asked if they needed help. They struck him with a beam of light, knocking him to the ground. Later, he found evidence at the site.

ENTITIES EXAMINE A FACTORY. One night in 1967, the supervisor at a rubber factory in Goshen, Indiana was called outside by a fellow employee and saw a large craft hovering low overhead. Through the windows, they saw strange figures looking down at them, apparently inspecting the factory. After only a few moments, the craft moved away. But the witnesses remain convinced they saw a genuine UFO.

ETs AT SEA! On Jun 27, 1970, the Machado family and a friend were enjoying lunch on the balcony of their home overlooking the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Seeing a splash in the water, they saw a silver saucer landing on the surface of the ocean just offshore. And inside they saw two short figures. The encounter had only just begun.

THE VIRGINIA GIANT. On evening of May 16, 1971, three high school students decided to go camping in the fields near their homes in Passapatanzy, Virginia. “Mike” was alone at the campsite with his dog. Suddenly a UFO landed right next to him, and out stepped a giant figure. When it walked towards Mike, he told his dog to “sick ‘em!” The figure quickly fled to the craft, which took off. But two days later, the UFO came back, this time at Mike’s home.

ETs ON THE ISLAND OF FUR SEALS. On Oct 28, 1972, a group of military personnel were staying on the Isla de Lobos off the coast of Uruguay. One of them went to check on the lighthouse generators, and came upon a landed craft and three strange humanoids. The officer pulled his gun, only to find himself unable to move. The UFO and occupants quickly departed, but news of the encounter would go to the top of both the Uruguayan and US governments.

“IT CAN’T BE HUMAN.” Around 2:30 am on Oct 24, 1974, Mrs. R Heitfeld was woken up in her home in Covedale, OH by a light shining in her window. Looking outside, she saw a UFO and a strange ape-like creature standing inside it. She woke up her son, and called the police. Even though the craft and occupant were still there, the police refused to come.

THE TINY DOLL-LIKE ALIENS. On Sep 3, 1976, a grandmother and her niece were walking in Fence Houses, England and came upon a landed craft and two doll-sized ETs. They found themselves unable to move and experienced possible missing time before the craft suddenly left. The next day, the witness experienced a very odd incident in her home.

TRUCKER ABDUCTED. Nothing could have prepared trucker, Harry Joe Turner, for what happened on Aug 28, 1979, while driving his truck along Route 17 outside of Winchester, VA. A huge craft came down and lifted his truck into the air. Harry found himself being examined by ETs, and taken to another planet. His strange adventures had only just begun.

ET PHONE HOME. On Jul 4, 1989, David D was driving in Tbilisi, Georgia (in Russia) when his car engine failed and he felt compelled to walk to a certain location. To his amazement, he came upon four figures, nearly nine-feet-tall, and a landed craft. He was taken onboard and given an examination and shown very advanced ET technology.

These ten cases provide only a brief glimpse into the many thousands of ET contact cases that have been occurring across our planet for many decades. They show that we still have a lot to learn about UFOs and about ourselves. They also make it very clear that we are not alone, and that many different types of life abound in this infinite universe.

UFO Encounters can be very weird, but some are incredibly odd. Some contain extremely high levels of strangeness with unique or rarely seen features. These are the kinds of cases that provide important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. This video presents ten exceptionally odd cases, reaching back to the 1930s up to the present day. They come from all over the world. And they provide undeniable evidence for the reality of the extraterrestrial visitations.

SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH. In 1933, a young man was driving late at night near Cherryville, PA and saw a strange purple light out in a field. Approaching, he was amazed to come upon some type of weird craft. And the door was open. Peering inside, he saw bizarre, unrecognizable equipment. He had never heard of UFOs, and it wasn’t until years later that he realized that the object was probably an alien craft.

KNOCKED OVER BY A UFO. On Oct 21, 1963, the Moreno family of Trancas, Argentina was woken by six glowing discs landed near their home. One was very close to them and when they went to investigate, it exploded with light, knocking them to the ground. For the next 40 minutes, the craft targeted their home with beams of light, raising the temperature inside to over 100 degrees. Afterward, it left evidence behind that amazed everyone.

UFO BENDS CAR HEADLIGHTS. Late at night on Apr 4, 1966, Ron Sullivan drove near Ballarat, Australia and came upon a landed. As he approached, his headlights bent by themselves, veering off the road and onto the object. Ron was barely able to keep his vehicle on the road. The object took off, and so did Ron. Two days later, another man driving by the exact same spot suffered an unexplained fatal accident.

THE UFO AND THE BLOODMOBILE. On the evening of Mar 5, 1967, Beau Shertzer and a nurse were driving a bloodmobile along Route 2 in the Ohio Valley when a UFO appeared and began to pace them. To their shock, the UFO extended to weird arm-like devices as if trying to capture the bloodmobile. Thankfully, oncoming traffic aborted the encounter. Beau was so traumatized, he refused to drive that route ever again.

THE BUBBLE-CAR UFO. One night in Aug 1970, Mr. P was riding his bicycle to his home in Birr, Ireland when he saw a bright star-like object zoom toward him and stop overhead. He could now see that it was a craft with a clear glass-like dome. He could hardly believe what he saw inside: four men and four women in military uniform sitting in two rows of seats.

CAR COOKED BY AN ALIEN. While driving along I-75 near Ashburn, GA, late at night on Oct 19, 1973, Mrs. Robinson’s car inexplicably broke down. Sensing a presence, she looked to her left and saw a short robotic entity staring at her. For the next five minutes it walked around her car, and then disappeared. Afterward, her car engine was so hot, it practically melted.

STUCK TO THE WALL BY A UFO. In 1976, a young man was babysitting his younger brother in their home in Bangor, Ireland. Oddly, the younger brother suddenly went to bed, the house heated up and all traffic noise stopped. Looking outside, the witness saw a glowing craft hover over the road. Without warning, it struck him with a beam of light, lifted him off the floor, threw him against the wall, and held him there. When it left, strange landing traces were found outside.

LEVITATED BY A UFO. On Feb 12, 1979, a man walking along the train tracks in Headingly, England saw a green object pace him. Suddenly, it moved overhead, pulled him up into the air, and carried him several feet forward. Then it set him gently back down and zoomed off. The witness was so shocked, he refused to ever walk that route again.

CONVERSATION WITH A UFO. On Mar 24, 1988, Mr. R was drawn outside by a strange light over his home in Tetbury, England. Suddenly it was right over his head and struck him with a beam of light. To his shock, the UFO spoke to him. Mr. R ended up having a long conversation with the UFO, which warned him that humanity's use of atomic power.

SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN’T EXIST. One night in Feb 2013, two teenagers from Richmond, BC, Canada were taking a walk, when a UFO appeared over their heads. They followed it to a nearby school and were shocked to see a black entity hanging upside from the monkey bars. It was an encounter that would change their lives forever. To learn more about this case (and many others,) check out my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

These ten cases provide a fascinating glimpse into the high strangeness that seems to be a big part of the UFO phenomenon. And although they are all incredibly odd, the fact that there are so many of them, viewed by multiple witnesses and supported by a wide variety of evidence, makes them hard to dismiss, ignore or explain away. UFOs are real! We are being visited by a wide variety of ETs. The truth is coming out!

Almost all UFO encounters are interesting, but some are exceptionally interesting. This is especially true with cases involving landed UFOs and extensive interactions with humanoids. This video presents ten exceptionally strange cases with bizarre or unique aspects. These ten cases (coming from across the world) contain powerful evidence for the reality of the alien presence on our planet, including landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more.

“IT’S NOT HUMAN!” Around 8:00 pm on Aug 23, 1967, two 15-year-olds (Erik & Inga) were walking near their home in Kolmarden, Sweden, and saw a glowing red craft in the sky, then land near them. Feeling like they were being watched, they fled. Moments later, they came face-to-face with a weird humanoid. It held an odd device in its hand and pointed it at them. The children ran in fear. Afterwards, landing traces were found.

ALIEN CAR MECHANICS? At 3:00 am on Apr 27, 1969, Mr. NN was driving south of Slagelse, Denmark when he had a feeling he was being watched. Suddenly a UFO appeared, zoomed towards his car and landed. His car engine and lights died. Four tiny ETs exited the craft and surrounded his car. Then a tube-like device extruded from the craft and snaked towards his car. After the craft left, landing traces proved the encounter.

UFOS INVADE IOWA FARM. In 1969, researcher Glenn McWayne was contacted by an electrical lineman about strange burned circles of vegetation in Clayton County, Iowa. In the center of the activity was a rural farmhouse. The family reported an ongoing series of sightings, landings, and even face-to-face meetings with humanoids. One of the kids saw a humanoid, and watched it remove its helmet and stare right at him.

THE ET IN THE CAGE. One summer morning in 1971, an anonymous nurse from Iowa City, Iowa was drove to work and saw a cage-like object dangling in the sky. To her shock, a figure in a white, thick, overall stared down at her from the cage. Unknown to her, many people in the area also saw the humanoid. Reports came into the local police station who began an investigation, but were unable to identify it.

THE SILVER-SUITED ALIENS. On the evening of Oct 22, 1973, Debbie Carne drove along a road outside of Hartford, Indiana when she saw two short silver-clad figures cross the road in front of her. Minutes later, Mr. & Mrs. Donathan drove along the same road and came upon the same entities. They reported them to the police. Gary Flatter was at the station and went with another officer to investigate, and saw the ETs himself.

THE ET IN THE GRAVEL PIT. At 2:00 pm on Mar 24, 1977, “Dan” walked by a gravel pit near his home by Wildwood Lake in Ontario, Canada when he felt a blast of heat. Looking down, he saw a strange metallic craft. Shortly later, he saw it again. This time, he approached and knocked on it. Then a strange-looking humanoid exited and stared right at him. When it moved toward him, Dan fled. But his encounters weren’t over yet.

ASSAULTED BY ALIENS. On Nov 24, 1978, Angelo D’Ambrose was collecting firewood near his home in Gallio, Italy when he saw two strange humanoids standing only three feet away. One of them lunged forward and tried to grab his woodcutting tool. After three failed attempts, the ETs fled. Angelo chased them, and was amazed to come upon a flying saucer., and watched as it departed. Nearby, other people also saw the UFO.

A WARNING FOR ALL HUMANITY. In 1979, Mr. DL of Edinburgh, Scotland was distressed to start hearing voices in his head calling his name. A visit to the doctor brought no relief. Later, on the evening of Feb 16, 1980, events came to a climax when Mr. DL saw a UFO hover. Suddenly he was struck by a beam of light, then was approached by three ETs. One approached him and issued a dire warning for all humanity.

THE PEEPING TOM ET. One evening in Mar of 1982, “Mary,” was taking a bath in her home in Hespeler, Canada, and saw a strange humanoid silhouette peer into her bathroom window. Then it happened again. When it happened a third time, there were two of them. Shortly later, she was shocked to see a UFO land in her backyard. Soon she would have another encounter!

“THEY WEREN’T HUMAN.” On the evening of Jul 21, 2001, “Jeff” was playing with his cousins near his grandmother’s home in rural Geneva, Pennsylvania. Suddenly the noticed a blue light in the woods. Going to investigate, he was shocked to come upon a landed UFO and two humanoids, who were picking up things off the ground. One of the ETs looked at him, and then the other.

When a person has an extensive face-to-face encounter with an extraterrestrial, they are forever changed. With so many cases occurring all over the world, supported by multiple eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence, the ET presence can no longer be denied, ignored, or covered up. The time has come to accept the truth of extraterrestrial visitation.

Aliens, aliens, aliens! People have been encountering humanoids for a very long time. In fact, there are strong indications that UFOs and extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth since recorded history. Only in the past century, however, has this subject been recognized, documented, and studied. This video presents 13 firsthand cases of face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrials. These cases span more than 100 years, starting in the 1920s, all the way up through the 2020s. They come from all over the world. They feature a wide variety of humanoids. And many contain multiple witnesses and compelling physical evidence, including landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, physiological effects and more.

UNDER THE PROTECTION OF ALIENS. In Aug 1923, Jacques B Bley (age 12) suffered from obesity, until he was visited by ETs in his home in Barcelona, Spain. Feeding him a mysterious substance, they healed Jacques and changed the course of his life forever.

THE ALIEN IN THE BACKYARD. One day in 1930, Joseph and Ella Rankin were shocked to see a large UFO hover overhead and then land in the backyard of their home in Greensboro, NC. Inside they saw a strange humanoid. It was an experience they kept secret for many years.

THE ALIEN WHO CAME TO SAY HELLO. On Jul 9, 1947, an unnamed merchant seaman from Houston, TX called the Houston Post to report a unique encounter. He said that a saucer landed by his home and out stepped a humanoid. The ET approached, shook his hand, then departed as quickly as he arrived.

THE HANDSOME HUMAN-LOOKING ALIEN. On Aug 20, 1954, sisters Aasta Solvang and Edith Jacobsen were picking blueberries near their home in Mosjoen, Norway when they were approached by a strange man. He spoke in a foreign language, then led them to a flying saucer parked in the forest.

THE ALIEN AT THE ICE-SKATING RINK. It was a sunny morning on Nov 28, 1972 as Mario Mercier ice-skated next to his home in La Sarre, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a weird cloudlike object landed and out stepped three robotic figures. By the time the encounter ended, there would be physical evidence.

THE ALIEN IN THE LIVING ROOM. On Nov 28, 1972, Alfonso Rey was watching TV in his home in Tres Arroyos, Argentina when his TV failed. As he got up to fix it, a strange-looking spaceman appeared in his living room, beginning a strange interaction that would result in a miraculous healing.

THE ALIEN AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. On the night of Feb 4, 1973, Brian Hunt and Sharyn Finckler drove along the Eyre Highway near Kimba, Australia and saw an amazing sight. Alongside the road was a glowing humanoid. They fled in fear. Little did they know, other people also saw the weird ET.

THE CROSS-EYED ALIENS. Around 2:00 am on Apr 30, 1983, Madame X of Sospel, France woke up to see a glowing red sphere in her bedroom. Moments later, four human-looking ETs appeared. And they had a profound message to share with her about the state of our world.

THE GIANT SILVER ALIEN. Tziporet Carmel of Kidima, Israel, was surprised to find herself waking up earlier than normal on Mar 20, 1993. She was even more surprised to look outside and see a huge silver craft landed in her backyard, and next to it, a giant silver alien. Her life would never be the same.

THE LITTLE GRAY ALIEN BOY. In Mar 1998, Felix Polanco had just begun to excavate a road near Fajardo, Puerto Rico when he saw something incredible in his headlights: a gray alien figure. It was definitely not human. Later that day, he and others would see a UFO in the same area.

THE FLYING ALIEN. When three residents of Narli, Turkey went to go plow their tobacco field on the morning of Jun 4, 2001, they were confronted by a 2-foot-tall flying humanoid. One of the witnesses, Fevzi Cam, tried to throw rocks at the short figure. Soon, others would see the weird alien.

APPROACHED BY AN ALIEN. On the evening of Feb 12, 2010, Roy Shaw, a retired engineer decided to take his dog, Sydney, for a walk in Phear Park, near his home in Exmouth, England. To their shock, they saw a landed UFO. Then a glowing figure exited the craft and began to approach them.

A NINE-FOOT-TALL ALIEN. On Sep 4, 1990, an unnamed man from Oregon stepped onto his patio around sunset and was amazed to see a 30-foot-diameter craft hovering only 50 feet above his neighbor’s roof. And inside, through a transparent dome, he saw a 9-foot-tall greenish-skinned creature.

These thirteen cases provide a mere glimpse into the huge number of extraterrestrial visitations that have been occurring across the globe for more than a century. With so many witnesses, so many cases, occurring year after year, decade after decade, and supported by compelling physical evidence, it’s time that humanity accepts we are not alone in this vast universe. In fact, the universe appears to be quite crowded! And one day, perhaps soon, everyone on Earth will become aware of this fact.

We are not alone in the universe! In fact, the evidence shows that Earth is being visited by a wide variety of humanoids. There are too many cases to ignore. Here are fifteen accounts where people have had face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrial humanoids. From the 1930s to the 2010s, these cases come from all over the world. They involve multiple eyewitnesses and are supported by compelling evidence such as photographs, landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and physiological effects. These cases have volumes to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and the ET agenda on our planet.
 
THE ALASKA ALIEN PHOTOGRAPH. In the early 1930s, an anonymous man was hiking through the forest in Alaska and saw a strange humanoid figure. As the figure fled into the woods, the man chased it and managed to snap a very intriguing photograph.

WARTIME UFO & HUMANOID. One night in Nov 1943, Lavenia Sledge stepped outside her home in Escondido, CA and saw a UFO with portholes hovering 15 feet above her home. Inside she could see two humanoid figures. She called her husband and son, who saw the object and figures.

“THEY LOOKED HIDEOUS.” It was 3:00 am on Jul 3, 1955 as Margaret Symmonds drove along Route 129 near Stockton, GA and saw four strange figures standing in the road. As she drove by, she saw that they were not human. One of them looked right at her.

THE ET IN THE TREE. When Hector Davis woke up in the middle of the night on Aug 25, 1968 while camping in Townsville, Australia, the last thing he expected to see was a four-foot-tall humanoid wearing a one-piece gray uniform standing in a tree looking down at him.

“THEY ARE MARTIANS!” When three teenagers became stranded in their car at a reservoir near Trois Rivieres, Canada in late Jul 1969, they saw a glowing saucer. To their intense fear, eight glowing humanoid figures exited and surrounded their car, trying to get inside.

“IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.” On the evening of Nov 22, 1973, Mrs. JP of Joliette, Canada woke up to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light shining in through the window. Looking outside, she saw a beautiful humanoid figure staring back at her. Meanwhile, other people in the area saw UFOs.

THE DAW PARK HUMANOID. Late at night on May 30, 1976 Trevor White was in his home in Daw Park, South Australia when his radio became staticky and the dog outside began to bark. Looking out the window, he saw a humanoid in a silvery uniform looking back at him, speaking a strange language.

“IT WAS NOT HUMAN.” When four men took a wrong turn while driving late at night on Jan 2, 1978 in Rainford, England, they were confronted by a 7-foot-tall humanoid wearing a glowing spacesuit. When the spaceman began to walk towards them, the men panicked. But the car wouldn’t start.

“MY LIFE BECAME HELL.” Around 9:00 pm on Sep 17, 1978, Rivo Faralli left his mother’s home in Torrita de Sienna Italy only to have a UFO drop down on the road in front of him. Two short humanoids came out and began walking around his car. They seemed more interested in his car, than in himself.

THE SILVER MONSTERS. On the afternoon of Oct 2, 1978, four young boys hiking in the Groendal Nature Reserve in Rhodesia, Africa, were astonished to see a landed UFO and three silver-uniformed humanoids walking by them. One carried a suitcase like object. Another stopped and looked right at them.

MONK-LIKE ALIENS. On the morning of Jun 20, 1986, Cesar Locatelli was out hunting bees near his home in Menetrux-en-Joux, France, but instead came upon a landed flying saucer. The craft was transparent, and inside, he saw six hooded figures studying something on a table. Then one turned in his direction.

CAT-LIKE EXTRATERRESTRIALS. On Aug 31, 1987, Randy Springsteen and Dennis Mauer were playing on the swing-set by their home on the Bangor Naval Base in Bremerton, Washington when a UFO appeared. Inside they saw cat-like humanoids. Then it emitted a beam of light on them, lifting them off the swing.

“I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SUCH BEINGS IN MY LIFE.” At 12:30 am on Jul 9, 1996, police officers Marian Mancu and Marcel Rusu of Cercesti, Romania were shocked to see a craft hover above the road. Out stepped three humanoids with elongated skulls.

THE ALIEN IN THE WHEAT FIELD. Just before dawn in Jun 2005, a farmer was bicycling to his mother’s farm in Scalenghe, Italy when he saw something strange: a tall humanoid with bulging eyes standing next to a floating sphere. Frightened, he biked away as fast as he could.

“I WAS COMPLETELY FROZEN.” On Dec 29, 2013, Madame L was petrified to see a glowing saucer hovering over the garage of their home in St. Zenon, Canada. Two weeks later, on Jan 14, her husband entered the garage and surprised a very unusual-looking humanoid doing a very strange thing in his garage.

Skeptics can no longer claim that there is no evidence. UFOs are real, and extraterrestrials are watching over us very closely.

So many UFO encounters! Each case adds to our knowledge of UFO activity and the ET presence on our planet. This video presents ten unique UFO stories from all over the world. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with  humanoids, and even one account of a little-known UFO crash. These cases provide compelling evidence for the reality of the phenomenon. How many documented cases will it take before humanity accepts the fact that we are not alone?

BRITAIN’S EARLIEST HUMANOID? In the summer of 1901, Frank (age 10) was walking near his home in Bournbrook in West Midlands, England when he saw what looked like a metal hut sitting in a field. Out stepped two short humanoids wearing gray jumpsuits and helmets with antennae. One of the figures gestured for Frank to keep back. With no idea of UFOs or ETs, it would be years before Frank understood what happened.

DEATH VALLEY UFO CRASH. On Aug 19, 1949 two prospectors, Buck Fitzgerald (age 73) and his friend Mase Garney were in Death Valley when a silver flying saucer zoomed overhead and crashed into the desert floor. Two short humanoids jumped out, saw the prospectors, and took off running. Buck and Mase chased them, but soon lost sight of them. Returning to the crash-site, the saucer was gone!

CAUGHT IN THE SPOTLIGHT. Around 7:00 pm on August 19, 1949, Sgt. Donald Berger shone an 8-million candlepower searchlight into the night skies of Norwood, Ohio for a publicity stunt for a festival. To his and everyone’s amazement, a glowing disc appeared in the searchlight beam. One month later, it happened again. And over the next year, eight similar incidents followed. Something truly strange was happening over Ohio.

A FOILED ABDUCTION. Early one evening in June 1960, the children of Mr. and Mrs. LeMarquands were playing outside their home in Thompson in Manitoba, Canada when a whirlwind began to swirl around them. Looking up, they saw a strange craft. Then one of the children rose from the ground toward the UFO. One of the neighborhood boys quickly grabbed the girl, preventing her from being pulled into the craft.

CHASED BY A UFO. It was 5:00 pm, Aug 24, 1967 as Ron Hydes drove his motorcycle south of Wodongo, Australia. Suddenly, a blinding light shone from above. Stopping, Ron was amazed to see a metallic saucer landed along the road, along with two silver-suited humanoids. One of them beckoned for him to approach. Terrified, Ron hopped on his motorcycle and fled. To his dismay, the UFO began to chase him.

THE ALIENS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. On a Sunday afternoon in Oct 1974, Alain and Patrick were driving out of their hometown in Aisne, France and noticed five very strange-looking short figures. They were four-feet-tall, wore robes, and had yellow skin, long black hair and enormous round black eyes. One of the figures waved for the two witnesses to come closer. Frightened, the witnesses drove off.

“DON’T LET IT GET ME!” Around 10:30 pm on Oct 28, 1976, Richard Britt and his son Richie returned to their home in Lake View, SC and saw a strange light whizzing over the trees. Richard went inside, but Richie remained outside. Then the light reappeared and suddenly zoomed forward, stopping only feet away from him. It was a saucer and looking at him through a large porthole was a strange creature.

THE ITALIAN ROBOT. Around midnight on Aug 31, 1977 and two students were walking outside of Sturno, Italy and noticed some strange lights alongside the road. Then they saw a giant silver robotic figure. They ran back to town and got more witnesses. Frightened, all the witnesses fled and got even more witnesses, beginning an encounter with a landed UFO and a silver humanoid that would leave the citizens of the town in shock.

THE ETS IN THE VILLAGE. When night arrived on Sep 1, 1978 in the small village of Llanerchymedd, Wales, many residents of the town noticed a strange object in the sky. Without warning, the object landed in a nearby field. Shortly later, three humanoids exited and began to walk around. As more and more people in the town witnessed the spectacle, panic swept through the town. Police were called. But the encounter wasn’t over yet!

THE SAUCER ON THE BACK PORCH. Around 4:00 am on February 7, 1981, Cindy Gaffney was woken up in her home in San Francisco, California by a loud buzzing noise. To her shock, she saw that a UFO had landed on her neighbor’s back porch. She woke up her husband who also saw the craft. She called the police, but they didn’t believe her or didn’t care.

These ten truly strange UFO encounters are just a tiny sample of the huge number of cases from all over the world. They show how complex the UFO phenomenon is, and the many strange things that happen when ETs make contact with humans. The truth can no longer be denied. The evidence speaks for itself. We are not the only intelligent beings living in this universe, and many of them are regularly visiting our planet.

There are many different kinds of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences, and more. Cases can be broken down into categories such as close encounters of the first, second, third and fourth kind. Then there are close encounters of the fifth kind, or human-initiated encounters. This unique category can contain all the other types of encounters, but is differentiated from them because the encounters themselves are the result of humans reaching out to ETs. Cases like these are important because they show that humans can develop an interactive relationship with the UFO phenomenon and the ETs. This video presents three extensive true cases of CE-5 contact that go beyond simple sightings and resulted in actual face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.

SOMETHING NOT OF THIS EARTH. In Jun of 1996, Jeneva Sterling drove to a remote location in the mountains of Santa Clarita, CA to seek answers about the many issues in her life. Depressed, she screamed out to the skies, “Why is life so crappy?! Why am I here?!” At that moment, a brilliant light appeared behind and moved towards her. Soon it was close enough to see it wasn’t any conventional craft. In fact, it was almost totally silent. Then it hovered directly overhead and beamed her with light. Thinking she was about to be abducted, Jeneva collapsed to the ground and trembled with fear. The beam retracted, but the strange light stayed overhead, making a low buzzing noise. Jeneva had never been so scared in her life, but soon her fear began to pass, and the object moved closer. Jeneva began to speak to it. Before long, her fear left and she realized that the UFO was not going to hurt her. In fact, the whole experience became deeply moving and spiritually transformative. The object remained there all night long, communing with Jeneva and totally lifting her out of her depression. When sunrise came, the UFO zoomed off. Jeneva, however, was forever changed. She became interested in UFOs and remote viewing, and began having vivid dreams of being onboard a UFO. And then, one day, the UFO returned.

A LOVE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. Hector Sawiak had never seen a UFO. But in Mar 2015, he heard about sightings near his home in San Juan, Argentina. He decided to go out hiking and try to have an encounter. Unfortunately, nothing showed up. But that night, after going to bed, he woke up to hear his name being called in his head. He jumped up and went to the window in time to see a brilliant UFO streak across the sky. He was amazed. Had the UFO occupants  woken him up to show their craft? A few months later, Hector was asleep in bed when the room filled with light. Waking up, he was terrified to see two tall ETs standing in the doorway. They were slender, with dark eyes and large bald heads, and wore olive-green jumpsuits. “Don’t be afraid,” they said. “We are not going to hurt you.” Hector’s fear evaporated and instead, he felt “a love like never before.” One of the ETs approached his bedside and said, “I have come to heal you.” Hector cried with intense joy and gratitude as the ETs gave him a tiny pill and told him to swallow it. The next thing he knew, it was morning. Hector knew his life would never be the same.

IN THE COMPANY OF EXTRATERRESTRIALS. In Apr 2015, 14-year-old Abdiel saw the TV show, Hangar One, all about UFOs. The subject immediately intrigued him. UFOs were real? He could hardly believe it. If they were real, he thought, he wanted to see one. One week later, he was in his backyard in Puerto Rico, when a bright light caught his eye, a golden-yellow object was moving across the sky. It was a UFO! Abdiel was amazed. He had expressed a desire to see a UFO one week earlier, and then one had appeared. That couldn’t be a coincidence. Before long he had another sighting. This was followed by weird knocks on the window of his home. Shortly later, he was amazed to see a strange circle in his backyard, just as if a UFO had landed there. Later he found another strange mark in the grass that looked like an ET head. Could the ETs be trying to contact with him? A few days later, Abdiel got his answer. Going into his backyard to inspect the marks on his lawn, he was shocked to observe a strange humanoid run across his yard. It was short, brown in color, with a large triangular-shaped bald head and big, dark, round eyes. It was an ET. Soon, more sightings would follow, and this time, his camera was ready.

These three cases all qualify as close encounters of the 5th kind. In each case, people reached out to the ETs and received a dramatic unmistakable response. These cases show just how closely ETs are watching over all of us, and that if a person asks for contact, they can initiate their own encounter and experience the UFO phenomenon firsthand. These three cases are covered in detail in my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!

It is perhaps the ultimate UFO encounter: being taken onboard a UFO. Unlike sightings, landings and face-to-face encounters, witnesses find themselves in a totally alien environment. The floor, the walls, the ceiling – everything around them is extraterrestrial, including the beings themselves. An onboard experience is the most extensive of all UFO encounters. They contain more data than any other encounter (except for perhaps a UFO crash/retrieval,) and often involve significant interaction and communication between the experiencer and the ETs themselves. These are the cases that have volumes to teach us about extraterrestrial contact. Here are five cases of onboard experiences. These cases provide significant evidence pointing towards the reality of UFOs and the ETs.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF JOYCE UPDIKE. In Aug 1967, Joyce Updike was cleaning her home in Platte, NB, late at night when the room filled with light. What seemed like moments later, she woke up in bed, only to find that hours had passed. Afterward, her husband found a circle of burned grass outside. Joyce had sore eyes, and some of her hair began to fall out. She became interested in UFOs, ancient civilizations, past-lives, and more. She began to have telepathy and poltergeist activity. Years later, she heard about UFOs and missing time, and realized that this is what she had experienced. Going under hypnosis, she recalled a long onboard encounter with human-like ETs who examined her and gave her messages about the future of Earth.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF ALEJANDRA MARTINEZ DE PASCUCCI. It was Jul 2, 1968, and Alejandra was walking to her home in Quilmes, Argentina when she was overcome by a strange magnetic force. Unable to move or cry out, the next thing she knew, she was lying down on a table onboard a UFO. The interior was white, spotless, with rounded walls. Beside her were two tall figures wearing glowing uniforms. While they looked human, Alejandra could see that they were “not from Earth.” They seemed to gesture to each other as they maneuvered the craft. Consumed with fear, Alejandra was ejected from the craft in a different location. Later, weird landing traces would provide more evidence of her encounter.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF JUDY KENDALL. Around 6:00 pm on Nov 26, 1972, Judy Kendall and her two sisters drove home from Zamora to Bodega Bay, CA, a two-hour trip. They were crossing the Cache Creek Bridge when the car felt weirdly cold, and an odd tiredness swept over them. They missed their exit only to find themselves crossing the same bridge twice! When they arrived home, more than four hours had passed. Their parents had called the police. Years later, Judy recalled her missing time event and underwent hypnosis. She recalled that her car had been lifted up from the highway and into a UFO. She was taken into a room and underwent a physical examination at the hands of small beings, one human-looking figure and a terrifying insectoid ET.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF KAREN LYSTER. It was a Friday night in Jan 1978 as Karen Lyster looked out the window of her hotel in Sydney, Australia to see a glowing object hovering outside. The next thing she knew, it was Sunday morning, and she was waking up in bed. She was missing more than a day of time. She later suddenly remembered that she had been pulled into the UFO and confronted by six beautiful people with dark hair, blue eyes, and flawless skin. They wanted to do tests on her hands, they said. Later, she was left alone in a weird round room. Karen decided to explore the craft. She walked down the hallway to another room where the walls turned transparent and revealed a field of stars. This was the latest of many encounters in her life.

THE ONBOARD UFO EXPERIENCE OF ANTONIO NELSO TASCA. On December 13, 1986, real-estate agent Antonio Nelso Tasca was driving on a dirt road outside of Chapeco, Brazil when he came upon a huge craft blocking the road. It struck him with a beam of light and pulled him inside. Antonio was examined by strange ETs and then was put into another room and undressed. A beautiful female humanoid entered and seduced him. After the two had an intimate encounter, she gave Antonio a long warning and a message for all humanity about the future of the planet and the need for radical change of society. Afterward, Antonio was dropped miles from the original location, with a large unexplained scar on his body. His case would become one of the best-verified in his country.

These five cases reveal many of the strange procedures that occur when people are taken onboard a UFO. They involve a wide variety of ET types and show how ET contact can affect a person profoundly in different ways. These cases also provide substantial evidence of the reality of UFOs, including landing traces, medical evidence, and electromagnetic effects. They also show that onboard encounters are occurring all over the world, and likely in large numbers. We are not alone!

What is it like to see an alien, to have a face-to-face encounter with an actual extraterrestrial? An experience like this often affects the witnesses on multiple levels, challenging them mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. It is a superlative experience that leaves them changed forever. Here are ten cases coming from across the world, spanning five decades, involving close-up encounters with strange humanoids. These cases provide profound insights into the nature of ET contact. They also contain compelling evidence of UFO reality.

THE QUIZZICAL ALIEN. May 1957, Frances Sticler was working on her farm in Milford, PA when she heard a loud whirring sound and sees a bowl-shaped craft approach and hover a mere 15 feet over her barn. The craft tilted towards her and to her amazement, she saw a humanoid looking down at her with a strange expression on his face.

IT WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. It was 5:30 a.m., on Jul 13, 1959, when Eileen Moreland was working on her farm in Blenheim, NZ. Looking up, she saw a circular craft zooming down towards her. It hovered a short distance away, sending out waves of heat. Inside she saw two humanoid figures. One stood up and appeared to look down at her. It was an experience which would have huge repercussions for years to come.

THE UFO HEADACHE. On the night of July 26, Adilson Batista Azevedo (age 14) joined his two friends to watch a movie at a theater in Carazinho, Brazil. On their way, a UFO swooped down and hovered overhead. Adilson’s friends fled in fear. But Adilson stayed to watch as first one craft and then another landed in the field next to him. Then out came short humanoid figures. Adilson approached closer and saw things that would affect him for the rest of his life.

THEY WERE NOT HUMAN. On the morning of Aug 13, 1965, Ellen Grace Ryerson and her sister, Laura Jean were working in a bean field along Russel Road near their home in Renton, WA, when they saw two humanoid figures. The sisters approached and were shocked to see that the figures had grey skin, bulging frog-like eyes, and wore strange outfits. They were not human!

IT KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW. On the evening of Jul 12, 1968, five children saw a UFO hovering near their home in Saint Stanislas-of-Kostka in Quebec, Canada. Running outside, they saw a short humanoid with a face like a frog. The children panicked and ran back inside. Later, they would find physical evidence in the form of landing traces.

I KNOW WHAT I SAW. It was an early fall morning in Summit County, UT, when Lennis Gines and her son Sam saw a UFO hovering only a few feet above the ground 450 feet from their home. It remained in place for more than 45 minutes before Sam went outside to confront them. That’s when he saw the strange humanoids coming in and out of the craft.

WE WERE FRIGHTENED AND FASCINATED. Mar 28, 1973, Clyde Donahower, his wife and their 8-year-old son saw a UFO near their home in Robesonia, PA. Inside they could see the silhouette of a humanoid figure busily moving around. When the craft remained for almost an hour, they decided to call the police.

I FELT A COLD SWEAT. It was a normal evening at work in a factory at Meylan, France when Julien Hermann received the shock of his life: a sparkling, glowing, green, humanoid figure stood outside his office window, only 50 feet away. At the same time, his radio filled with static. He ran outside to get a closer look.

TWO THINGS CAME DOWN. It was the middle of the night when teenager, Deanne Kerns saw a grayish saucer sending down a beam of light near her home in Ord, NE. Suddenly, two strange beings with arms like tentacles appeared in the beam, levitated down to the ground, and began picking vegetation and taking soil samples.

TWO LITTLE MEN CAME OUT. It was early evening in 1990 when goat-herder, Flores de Mamani and her dog were taking her goats to her home in Tucuman, Argentina, home and suddenly they all became paralyzed. A large spherical object appeared overhead and out came two small humanoids who walked up to Flores and took a blood sample. The other approached her goat and did something she could hardly believe.

These ten cases are only a small sampling of the huge number of humanoid encounters that are occurring across this planet. The time for skepticism is over. Governments across the world are admitting to the reality of the ET presence on our planet. The evidence is undeniable. We are being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrials. And it is the humanoid cases that reveal why they are here and their agenda on our planet.

Nothing like it had ever happened before. And it would never happen again. The French UFO wave of 1954 was unprecedented. Starting in early September of 1954, hundreds, if not thousands of UFO encounters swept across the country of France with incredible fury. For the next two months, encounters occurred daily, often multiple accounts each day. These were not just sightings, but landings and face-to-face encounters with humanoids of all kinds. Witnesses included people from all walks of life: farmers, teachers, housewives, business-owners, government officials, children, even entire families. As the activity mounted, so did the fear. People were afraid to go outside at night. Others began to arm themselves for protection, sometimes attacking neighbors or passersby thinking they were “Martians!” Skeptics and debunkers became overwhelmed, unable to explain away the experiences. The press went wild, unable to keep up with the huge onslaught of cases. Day after day, people reported UFOs flying overhead, landing next to their homes, blocking the roads. The sightings are incredible enough. But most interesting are the cases involving humanoids.

This video presents a day-by-day accounting of more than fifty humanoid encounters in the months of September and October 1954 alone. ETs coming out of their craft, collecting plants and animals, approaching terrified citizens, and in some cases communicating with them in various ways. The cases provide nearly the entire gamut of physical evidence with many producing landing traces, animal reactions, weird medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more.

The question is, why? Why did this super-wave of such unparalleled ferocity strike France? Why France? Why September and October of 1954? Why so many landings and humanoids? Were they looking for something? Was this a display designed to convince the citizens of the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials? 

An examination and analysis of these cases reveals some remarkable insights. One thing is clear: something very profound happened during these sixty days, something that would forever change the way the entire world viewed the UFO phenomenon. The wave would inspire researchers like Aime Michel and Jacques Vallee and many others to research the UFO phenomenon and produce books and articles about the amazing wave of activity. There may have been some very profound and important reasons for one of the most intense UFO waves in all of human history.

There’s nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid. These cases are the heart of the UFO phenomenon. They are the cases that teach us the most about extraterrestrial contact. They’re also the most interesting. This video presents ten cases that span five decades and come from all over the world. They present nearly the entire range of UFO evidence, including multiple eyewitness testimony, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic interference, landing traces and more. They show how many different ET-types there are, and answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon: who the ETs are, where do they come from, and why are they visiting our planet?

“THEY WERE VERY GOOD-LOOKING.” One summer evening in 1946, Vida Goldsworthy and her sister were walking their dog in downtown Johannesburg, South Africa when they saw a huge craft hovering above a nearby hotel. To their amazement, two tall ETs came out and looked down at them. Vida was impressed by how beautiful they were. It was one of South Africa’s first recorded humanoid encounters.

“WE COME FROM CASSIOPEIA.” In Sep 1955, Joseph Wanderka rode his moped through a forest path in Arbesthal, Austria, and came upon a landed UFO. Going onboard, he met six child-like human-looking ETs. He told them about the many problems of Earth society and asked if they could intervene. They told him that although they had long since moved past wars, disease and corruption that no, they couldn’t intervene, and that Earth people had to solve their own problems.

ALIENS GO CAMPING. On Mar 10, 1961, Mr. Reynolds and his son went camping at Bowna Reserve in Albury, NSW, Australia and saw what they first thought were other campers. They saw strange figures and a vehicle of some kind. When it suddenly disappeared without a trace, they knew they had seen something very strange. They soon learned that many people in the area had seen unusual UFO activity.

ANOTHER HITCHHIKING ALIEN. On the night of Aug 27, 1972, Eduardo Dedeu was driving between Medanos and Bahia Blanca, Argentina, when he picked up a hitchhiker. He was fascinated to see that the man had an abnormally long face and huge chin. He did not look human. Then the car engine failed, and he came upon a UFO landed on the highway. His mysterious passenger exited, and the UFO took off, leaving Eduardo shocked to the core.

THE LE BIHAN FAMILY UFO ORDEAL. On Sep 29, 1974, the Le Bihan family of Riec-Sur-Belon, France was amazed to see a giant UFO hovering near their home. Three glowing figures came out and began to march towards them. Terrified, the Le Bihans fled their home. Unknown to them, their neighbors were also experiencing weird activity. It was an encounter that would affect them all for a long time.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SAW IT. On Jun 22, 1976, hundreds of residents of the Canary Islands witnessed one of the most dramatic UFO displays on record in their country. One or more UFOs flitted around in the sky for nearly an hour. Some residents saw the UFOs very close up, close enough to see two extremely tall ETs dressed in red jumpsuits looking down at them from above.

THE FLYING HUMANOID. On Jul 12, 1977, Adrian de Olmos of Quebradillas, Puerto Rico was puzzled to see a child-sized figure wearing a strange jumpsuit approach the front of his home. He called his family and the neighbors, and they all watched this short humanoid fly around among the trees near their homes. It caused a near panic in the town, and even the animals were acting crazed. 

MISSING TIME ON THE TUG FORK RIVER. On the night of Jun 14, 1978, teenagers Bryan Duty and John Wright when fishing near their home in Naugatuck, WV. Although they caught no fish, they did see a UFO which struck them with a beam of light. They were unable to move and the next thing they knew, they were running home. Both had vague memories of being taken onboard the craft.

ENCOUNTER ON THE MOUNTAIN. On Oct 3, 1978, Hideichi Amano was playing with his ham radio on top of a mountain near Sayama City, Japan. Suddenly his car blazed with light. The engine died, and then suddenly a weird humanoid appeared and pressed a strange device against his head. For several moments, Hideichi remained paralyzed. Finally, the humanoid departed and Hideichi fled the area. But he would never be the same again.

THE ET IN THE CORNFIELD. On July 23, 1982, three teenagers were camping in a cornfield near Sainte-Dorethee, Quebec, Canada when a UFO appeared overhead. Shortly after it left, a tall humanoid appeared near their tent, frightening them so badly, they ran away, leaving everything behind. Unknown to them, another nearby witness was watching the whole thing.

These ten cases reveal the startling complexity of the UFO phenomenon and provide compelling evidence for the reality of extraterrestrial visitations. They provide another piece of the UFO puzzle and remind us all that we are not alone!

One puzzling enigma of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Blue Beings…the list is endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world report many supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes…little people of all kinds. Could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are many reports like this, and it's still going on today! This video presents ten cases of people who have encountered little people which might be either an elf or alien!

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a lady was picking berries in the forest near her home in when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing nearby was an elf-like creature holding an axe. The woman fled the area. She returned later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when one afternoon, he heard someone tapping on the window. He was amazed to see a tiny man only with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man had large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark pants and leather shoes. He introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared many times, shared special stories with him and performed playful antics to make Galen laugh.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. On Christmas morning in 1957, a seven-year-old boy woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed. He wanted to jump up and investigate but couldn't move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. One cold morning in 1976 a lady exited her home in Appleby, TX. To her shock, a tall, winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin sat on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange, burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about 20 feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap. Turning, he saw a short, fat, dwarf with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. He wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. Two weeks earlier, a family in the area saw the same figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. One summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal when he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the ET presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe.

There are all kinds of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, onboard experiences and more. Then there are the cases involving animals. In fact, one of the categories of UFO evidence involves animal reactions, and there are many examples. Much rarer are cases where weird things happen to animals. This video presents eight cases in which weird things happen to animals during UFO encounter. These cases involve the entire range of UFO encounters and a wide variety of animals. These cases span six decades, involve many witnesses, and come from all over the world. And all of them are just a bit weird!

THE FLOATING HORSE. On Oct 16, 1954, Guy Puyfourcat led his mare to his home in Cier-de-Riviere, France. His horse got spooked and glanced to the right. Guy saw three figures dart into the bushes. He then heard a shrieking sound as a small, gray, saucer-shaped craft rose 150 feet, then moved toward him and stopped briefly, at which point his horse levitated 9 feet into the air. The craft darted away, and his horse dropped, temporarily paralyzed. After 10 minutes, it got up, sweaty and trembling.

THE PARALYZED DOG. On Oct 17, 1954, Maxime Pignatelli was hunting with his dog along the Durance River near Corbieres, France. Looking ahead of him, he saw a 12-foot-wide black oval object on the ground. On top was a dome, and inside he saw two child-like beings. The two figures exited the craft. Maxime’s dog ran toward them, but Maxime panicked, falling into a ditch. His dog came crawling back, howling and dragging its back legs. As they fled, Maxime felt a wave of tiredness come over him.

THE SHEEP SLAUGHTERING ALIEN. One night in 1968 Valentina Flores of Otoco, Bolivia, was herding her lamas into their pens when she noticed saw that strange netting had been placed over it and a 4-foot-tall humanoid was inside, using a tube-like instrument to kill her sheep. She threw rocks at him. He responded by throwing his hooked instrument at her which cut her arms and returned to his hand like a boomerang. The figure grabbed the netting, rose into the air and disappeared. Valentina saw that 34 sheep had been killed.

GOAT KIDNAPPED BY ETS. On Sep 22, 1972, a peasant woman from Villa Altagracia in the Dominican Republic was shocked to see a strange craft covered with lights landed on the ground. Out came two short beings who proceeded to grab a goat. The goat seemed to be paralyzed as the two short beings carried it into the craft, which took off at great speed and disappeared from sight.

CAN WE HAVE FOUR OF YOUR RABBITS? On the night of Aug 17, 1977, Marco Antonio de la Cuadra woke up in his home in Alto Jahuel, Chile. An odd buzzing sound was coming from his rabbit hutch. Going outside, he came upon an oval object landed on the ground. In front of it was a human-looking male with blond hair wearing a tight-fitting white suit. The man said he was part of a scientific exploration looking for new species to help re-populate his planet. He wanted fish. Marco said he had no fish, but he did have rabbits.

THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE CHICKENS. On the night on Mar 3, 1980, Vivian Rodriguez woke up to her dogs barking and a commotion on the porch of their home in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Looking outside, she saw 5 short humanoids searching the porch. She woke up her brother, Jose, and they watched as the beings showed a great interest in their chickens. The figures fled when a car approached. Unknown to the siblings, only a few miles away, two men saw the same figures climb into a landed UFO which took off over the city.

I SAW A DOLPHIN ONBOARD A UFO. In Jan 1981, a woman and her mother were driving on a highway in Manchester, England when suddenly there were no other cars. They saw a strange light ahead of them and noticed an old-fashioned car. Suddenly the car turned into a UFO, which disappeared. Getting home, they noticed that they were missing 2 hours. Under hypnosis, the witness recalled being taken onboard the craft where she saw a human-looking ET. He led her into a room where there was a small pool and a sick dolphin.

PIG-SNATCHING ALIENS. In the wee hours of the morning of Sep 12, 2006, Evan Briese of Tappen, ND woke up and saw something in their pig corral. Thinking it was a coyote, he grabbed his rifle. To his shock, he saw two 8-foot-tall beings stealing their pregnant sow. Evan fired his gun. One of the beings screamed while the other flew towards him and knocked him unconscious. Upon awakening, Evan saw that his shirt was ripped to shreds and the pregnant sow was gone. And this was just the beginning.

These cases reveal an alien agenda that includes a strong interest in animals of all kinds, and that ETs can affect animals in ways we are only beginning to understand. Whether it’s levitating a horse, paralyzing a dog, killing sheep or taking rabbits and pigs, the ETs are visiting many locations all across are planet, and have been doing so for decades.

The UFO phenomenon is one of the most persistent and perplexing mysteries of modern times. But is it still fair to call it a mystery? Or do we know what UFOs are? Sightings can be misidentified. But when someone experiences a landed UFO and humanoids, the chances of misperception are negligible. These cases make it very clear that we are dealing with humanoids, people like us, but from beyond Earth. These are the cases which teach us the most about the UFO phenomenon, how it manifests, where ETs come from, why they are here, and their agenda on this planet. These five cases, spanning many decades, and coming from across the planet, answer many of the questions surrounding this subject, and show just how amazing and transformative UFO contact can be.

TURKEY’S FIRST UFO CONTACTEE. In December of 1948, Behcet Ocal was only 15 years old when he became a UFO contactee. He was shepherding sheep near his home in Nigde, Turkey, and a glowing UFO dropped down and landed next to him. Out stepped three unusual humanoids, two males and a female, who told him not to be afraid, and that they would be contacting him in the future. One of them reached out and touched his shoulder, causing him to pass out. In the days and weeks that followed, Behcet was visited many times and given profound information about the nature of the universe. 

THE ALIEN IN THE FACTORY. One of the most amazing humanoid encounters in UFO history occurred at the Ika-Renault Factory in Santa Isabel, Argentina. On the morning of September 21, 1972, factory janitor Teodoro Merlo opened the company washrooms and was puzzled to find one of the lights burned out and the room unnaturally hot. Then looking at one of the washbasins, he was shocked to see a 7-foot-tall humanoid figure looking at him. One day later, another factory worker, Enrique Moreno was delivering papers when he came upon the same humanoid, causing his 3-wheeler to malfunction. Later, he would see the figure again. The next day, another employee, a truck driver had an encounter with the same being. Unknown to any of them, multiple workers and even people outside the factory also saw the humanoid and UFOs too.

THE SIDEWAYS ALIEN. It was the middle of the night in December 1993, and Monsieur VM of Vilvoorde, Belgium woke up to relieve himself. He noticed an eerie green light shining in through the kitchen window, and looked outside, was shocked to see a short humanoid figure wearing a helmet and jumpsuit walking through his yard. The witness shone his flashlight at the being, which turned around, gestured at him, then proceeded to walk sideways up the 9-foot-tall brick-wall in the backyard. Moments later, a glowing craft with a transparent dome rose from behind the wall and hovered for several minutes, before darting away. Nobody else saw the event, but VM had encounters both before and after this, and both times, he did have witnesses.

“THEY WALKED LIKE ROBOTS” On the evening of May 27, 1977, three 14-year-old boys were hiking in the fields near their homes in West Pittsburg, CA. Without warning, a massive craft with red lights and portholes darted back and forth and then landed right next to them. Then three tall shadowy beings exited and began to walk towards them. The boys fled the scene. To their shock, the entities followed them, chasing them at high speed for several blocks through the suburbs. The encounter attracted leading researchers, such as J. Allen Hynek, who called it one of the most credible humanoid reports of the year.

TWELVE BEINGS APPEARED. It was a late August night in 1979 when Carol X, a resident of Gateshead, England noticed a strange orange light shining in through the window. Parting the curtains, she saw a brightly lit craft hovering near her home. It darted away, but moments later, a tiny UFO entered her bedroom and released a swarm of tiny lights which descended upon her. It was the beginning of a series of strange events, including an incredible visitation by a dozen short humanoids which crowded into her bedroom, and were soon seen by other family members. Then the high strangeness continued to escalate.

So many people all over the world having extensive encounters with ETs. The coverup is ending. Disclosure is happening. The time for skepticism is over. The truth of the ET presence can no longer be denied. Now it’s time to accept the fact that we are not alone and try to determine how we can engage with these visitors to our planet.

Among the most fascinating and extensive cases of UFO contact are landings and 
face-to-face encounters with humanoids. These accounts have volumes to teach us 
about the ETs, who they are, why they are here, and their agenda on our planet. 
This video presents five fascinating cases of UFO contact, each providing some 
profound and unique insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon.

THE ALIEN WITH THE BEAMING SPHERE. Late at night on June 14, 1968, Pedro Jacobo Pretzel of Villa Carlos Paz, Argentina, drove up to the Motel La Cuesta (which he owned) and saw two hovering red lights. He didn’t think much of. Going inside, he found his daughter, Maria, kneeling on the floor, babbling about a strange man. Maria had an amazing story to tell. She said that a tall blond man in a shiny blue jumpsuit had entered the motel and confronted her. He held a weird glowing sphere in his hand, which caused odd sensations in her body. “Don’t be afraid,” he said. Then he pointed a beam of light at her, causing her to float slowly to the ground. It was just the beginning of a complicated interaction with an ET. It was a case which would go all the way to the Argentine Air Force.

THE ALIENS ON THE MOUNTAINTOP. Around 8:30 pm, on October 19, 1973, Gabriel Demogue and his girlfriend took his motorcycle up Malmont Mountain near Draguignan, France. When she saw a UFO pacing them, she insisted they turn around, which they did. Returning to town, Gabriel told his friends what happened. Four of them decided to return to the mountain in two cars and investigate. To their shock, they came upon a UFO landed on top of the mountain, out of which came three ET figures. Two of the men fled in their car, while the other two found that their car’s engine failed. While trying to get away, they had repeated sightings of the ETs. Meanwhile, the friends who had fled the scene also saw the ETs crossing the road in front of them.

THE ALIEN ON LONGFORD ROAD. It was a late August afternoon in 1976 when three 10-year-old children, Susan and John Harris, and their friend Paul Smith went to play outside their homes on Longford Road West in Reddish, England. Susan went inside to get some juice. That’s when the boys heard a strange sound, saw a flash of light, and a human-looking ET dressed in a silver jumpsuit floated out of the bushes nearby. Moments later, he disappeared. Back in the house, Susan looked out the window and the same ET looking right at her. He turned, bent down and started taking soil samples from the ground. Susan screamed and the man disappeared. Running outside, she met with the boys and together they saw the strange man again. And shortly later, a flying saucer rose up from the field.

THE SOUTH MIDDLETON ALIENS. On the evening of January 7, 1978, Theresa Gould saw a bright object land behind her home in South Middleton, Massachusetts. She called a friend and strangely, the phonelines went dead. Unknown to her, Theresa’s relatives were trying to call. Her 14-year-old son, Douglas, had gone to sleep over and a strange glowing man appeared in the children’s bedroom. The father thought it was their imagination, until he saw the figure himself. The next day, Theresa’s husband, Thomas, was cutting wood on their property when he saw the same figure. He had seen it several times over the last month and tried to chase it down. He could never catch it, so this time, he just watched it. After an hour, it disappeared. Thomas drove near his home and came upon a landed UFO. He told his family, The next day when the UFO landed again. Soon everyone in the family began seeing the ETs.

THE ALIENS BY THE BOBR RIVER. Around dusk on July 8 or 9, 1990, Ryszard P parked his car along the Bobr River. Walking into the woods, he heard a strange sound and smelled an odd burning odor. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a huge silver object landed by the river. Inside a window of the craft, he saw two humanoids. But outside, he saw more than a dozen of the short figures. They wore helmets with white faceplates and mummy-like green uniforms. Their arms flexed in both directions, but their legs seemed bound together. The beings jumped around like kangaroos. Each held a tubelike device in their hands, which they were using to test or measure the vegetation. Ryszard watched in awe, and then he coughed. At that moment, he lost all awareness. He woke up, still standing, but found that an hour had passed. The craft and the beings were gone, but the effects on Ryszard had only just begun.

These five cases show how UFO encounters can be both strikingly similar and incredibly different. The shapes of the UFO craft show great variation. And the different types of ETs. But each involves unknown craft and face-to-face encounters with humanoids. These kinds of cases make it clear that we are not alone, that people all over the planet are being visited by many different kinds of extraterrestrials.

UFO encounters are known for high strangeness. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, onboard experiences – all often contain bizarre aspects that defy explanation. The question is, why? Is this an intentional act on the part of the ETs to encourage us to seek new answers? Here are 10 weird UFO cases of extreme high strangeness that might help answer these questions.

WEIRD EFFECTS FROM A UFO. In Nov 1953, Trygve Jansen and Gudrun Buflod drove along the Mossevei Road by Gjresjoen Lake in Norway. Suddenly a UFO dropped from the sky, swooped at their car and blocked their path on the road. After a short stand-off, the object flew away. The weirdness wasn't over. The UFO affected the watch Trygve wore, the car he was driving, and caused strange physiological changes in both witnesses.

A UFO IN DISGUISE. On Jul 2, 1954, Mrs. R and 8 family members drove along Highway 97 near Crater Lake, OR. Low on gas, they decided to stop at the next gas/food stop. Up ahead, they saw a brightly-lit café all by itself by the highway. Their car died and they rolled into the parking lot. The building was round and covered with lights. Inside, they were amazed to see curved mirror-like walls, translucent tables, and a waiter and waitress only four feet tall and dressed in silver uniforms. The high strangeness had just begun.

A UFO DEPOSITS UNKNOWN MATERIAL. On May 10, 1957, Michel Fekete rode his bicycle on his way home in Beaucourt sur L’Ancre, France. A bright light on the road ahead dazzled him and he saw 4 short menacing figures approach. He ran to the neighbors, and they all watched for the next 20 minutes as the figures darted back and forth. The object departed, but it left behind patches of a strange black, elastic material.

THE ALIEN ROBOTS. On Oct 23, 1965, James Townsend was 4 miles from his home in Long Prairie, MN when a rocket-shaped UFO landed on the road in front of him. Several tiny tin-can-shaped robotic figures exited the craft and began to approach. James had the feeling they were watching him. Little did he know, many people in the area were also seeing UFOs.

CHASED BY A UFO. At 8:00 a.m., on April 8, 1966, Gary Hunt and Mike Dorsey (both age 12) were walking to school in Norwalk, CT when a UFO swooped over their heads. It then made a U-turn in the sky and swooped down again, and then a third time. The boys fled in panic. The UFO chased them into the woods, forcing them to hide under a bridge. Other people in the area watched their ordeal. Later, the boys were questioned by a secret govt agent.

“I WAS SHOT BY AN ET RAY-GUN!” On Sep 3, 1976, Joao Romeu Klein was walking to his home in Santa Catarina, Brazil. A flying disc approached and hovered ahead of him on the path. A red beam of light shone down and deposited 3 dwarf-like figures who blocked his path. Then the UFO darted behind Joao, blocking his escape. Joao threw his work-knife at the creatures. But they responded by aiming a ray-gun at him, striking him with a beam of light.

UFO PREDICTS FATAL BUS ACCIDENT. On Mar 18, 1988, a bus carrying 22 members of a religious sect plummeted from a mountain highway, killing 4 passengers and injuring 18 others. The driver (who had been drinking) was charged with murder. The head of the sect, Peter Thomas, revealed that the group had seen a UFO, and that night, he had dreamed about the UFO, which warned him that a tragic accident would occur.

BURNED BY A UFO. On Mar 31, 1980, two circus employees (Paride Orfei and Phelipe Garcia) stood by the circus tent in Gioia del Colle, Italy when a bright light zoomed down and hovered overhead. It stayed only briefly but caused the circus animals to react strangely. Seconds later, it darted away. That’s when both men realized that they had been burned by the UFO.

THE UFO WITH TENTACLES. On Oct 27, 1981, three young girls (Pia Andersson, Carina Sjostrom and Anna-Karin Lindahl) rode their horses near their homes in Kvilla, Sweden. The horses were acting up when a glowing disc dropped from the sky and hovered overhead. It had weird tentacle-like appendages around the perimeter. All the girls were paralyzed in fear. Finally, the object left, and the girls galloped home.

THEY LOOKED LIKE BAGS. Late at night on Nov 2, 1989, two truck drivers, Oleg Kirzhakov and Nikolai Baranchikov encountered a landed UFO on a remote highway near Arkhangelsk, Russia. The truck engine died, so Oleg went to investigate the craft. At first a weird forcefield prevented his progress. But then a door opened, and weird bag-shaped figures emerged. The next thing Oleg knew, he was being taken onboard.

These encounters all contain unique and bizarre elements of high strangeness and show just how bizarre UFO contact can be. And yet, many also have physical evidence: landing traces, medical affects, EM effects, animal reactions and more. These very weird cases have something very important to teach us about UFOs and extraterrestrials.

One of the rarest kinds of UFO encounters is when a craft lands on the ground. But the fact is, there are thousands of cases on record like this. They reach back decades up to the present day. They come from all over the world. Many have multiple witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence including animal reactions, landing traces, EM disturbances, medical effects and more. These cases make it clear that UFOs are technological advanced machines. Here are a dozen cases of this kind which show just how strange and fascinating the UFO phenomenon can be.

APR 7, 1950, AMARILLO, TX: When David Lightfoot (age 12) and his cousin Charles Lightfoot (age 9) went fishing by their home, they saw an odd object zoom overhead, circle around, and then land next to them. It was only a few feet wide. David ran up to the craft and touched it as it took off. Afterward, his arms and face were red and covered with welts.

NOV 3, 1960, PRICE COUNTY, WI: Two eight-year-old boys (Douglas Fox and Mr. Gehring) decided to test their new bow and arrow out in the wilds near their home. Hearing a weird noise and feeling a blast of heat, they looked up and saw a flying saucer land on the hill next to them. They ran up to it, at which point it took off. The ground at the site was still hot.

JUL 19, 1965, VAUCLUSE BEACH, NSW, AUSTRALIA: Denis Crowe was taking a walk along the beach when he saw a glow ahead and heard barking dogs. As he approached, he saw that the light was a silver saucer-shaped craft resting on short landing legs. He got to within 60 feet, at which point it shot upwards, leaving burned marks on the ground.

MAR 1, 1966, CARSON CITY, MI: Two seven-year-olds were walking in a field near their home when they came upon a huge, silver, cigar-shaped craft. Heat waves were coming off it. As they walked up to it, it took off in a weird zigzag maneuver. On the ground they found crushed, burned grass and strange holes.

MAR 29, 1966, HAMILTON, ONTARIO, CANADA: Charles Cozens (age 13) watched in awe as two strange craft landed directly behind the local police station. He approached one of the craft and actually touched it. It felt smooth and metallic, but as he touched it, an electric arc three feet long zapped him on the hand, causing a burn.

MAR 29, 1966, ANCHORAGE, AK: It was many years after the incident when a young man remembered his childhood encounter with a UFO that landed on the street right in front of his house. The craft was about 50 feet wide and had a little ladder leading down to the ground. Unknown to the witness, his own brother watched from the house.

AUG 26, 1968, GLEESON, AZ: Pearl Christensen was driving home when she saw two large craft landed on the peak of the nearby 7200-foot-high Brown’s Peak. She watched them through binoculars for almost 4 hours. Another witness also saw them. Later, researchers went to the landing spot and found landing marks and burned vegetation on the site.

MAR 13, 1975, MELLEN, WI: The Baker family could hardly believe their eyes when they saw a classic, silver flying saucer with colored lights and a dome on top landed on the street right next to their home. They called the police, but the craft departed. But the next few days, the craft returned and was seen by many people, including police officers.

Nov 10, 1978, KUWAIT: Seven oilfield workers got the shock of their life when a UFO landed next to the Al Sabriyah oil pumping station, knocking it off-line. It was as big as a jumbo jet and remained there for 7 minutes. An investigation revealed sightings both before and after. One man even photographed the UFO. The case went to the highest levels of govt.

Nov 27, 1978, LEEDS, ENGLAND: Lynsey Tebbs and Susan Pearson (both age 14) were walking near their homes they saw a UFO hover overhead and then land right next to them. They turned to run, but the craft took off. They stopped and watched it land again. Researchers arrived and discovered strange landing traces. Then the govt showed up!

MAR 30, 1995, TRANSVAAL, SOUTH AFRICA: Jan Pienaar was driving along a country road when he came upon a landed UFO right in the middle of the road. His truck engine failed, and he became paralyzed. The craft, he saw, had a gaping hole in the side. Shortly later, the craft took off, leaving behind scorched marks. Other people in the area also saw UFOs.

APR 10, 2002, CROSSVILLE, TN: A teacher woke up early in the morning and saw a 20-foot-wide metallic craft floating on the surface of the lake. She watched it for one minute, then went to get her husband. When they returned, the craft was gone. Later she saw an object exit the lake, and further events revealed that she was having direct contact.

These cases show that UFOs are physical machines utilizing an advanced technology far beyond our own. These cases leave no doubt that we are being visited. They are only a small sampling of the huge number of cases involving UFO landings.

This is a strange category, but there are many cases where people encounter a craft that is so close, they can see the humanoids inside of it! It’s a unique category that is more than just a UFO sighting, but not quite an onboard experience. Yet, they are equally fascinating and often involve very high strangeness. With multiple witnesses and lots of physical evidence, these cases represent an important contribution to our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.

1952, SEAT PLEASANT, MD: It was a hot summer night, when Suzanne Knight heard a strange buzzing noise. Looking outside, she saw a glowing object descend. She thought it might be a crashing plane, but then the object stopped and through one of the windows, she saw a strange figure.

1954, RANTON, ENGLAND: Hearing a strange sound, Jessie Roestenburg rushed outside her home and saw her two children lying on the ground in shock. A large UFO hovered overhead. And looking down at them through a large picture window were two beautiful human-looking ETs.

1957, OLD SAYBROOK, CT: When a bright light flooded her room, Mary Starr looked outside and saw a massive cigar-shaped craft hovering only a few feet above the ground. It was lined with portholes, and inside the craft she saw three very strange figures wearing weird uniforms and strange square helmets.

1959, MARIANNELUND, SWEDEN. Suffering a sudden power-failure, Gideon Johansson exited his house only to watch a saucer-shaped craft descend into his yard and almost land. Through the windows, she saw two strange bald figures with big beautiful eyes filled with intelligence. 

1962, LAKE MOVIL, MN: After the entire family had a UFO sighting, Mildred Anderson and her daughter Marilyn notice an odd glowing red object outside their cabin. Looking outside, they are amazed to see a large window on a craft, and inside are two ETs staring right at them.

1968, REUNION ISLAND, FRANCE: Hiking in the forest to pick some grass for his plants, Luce Fontaine comes upon a massive craft hovering about 15 feet above the ground. Through a massive picture window, he saw two ETs wearing spacesuits that looked just like the Michelin Man.

1973, MANCHESTER, NH: Driving home, Lyndia Morel was puzzled by a colorful star-like object that blinked on and off and seemed to follow her car. Without warning, the object appeared in front of her car, a massive craft. And looking down at her was a gray-skinned alien with big dark eyes.

1974, MEDELLIN, SPAIN: Driving to his father’s farm, Santiago Pulido Romero saw a UFO pacing his car. He blinked his headlights at the object, which reacted by zooming towards him. As he arrived at the farm, the craft followed. And inside, through the window of the craft, were weird-looking aliens.

1975, SAN ANTONIO, TX: He first thought it was a helicopter, but when it hovered over his truck, Alois Olenick realized he was seeing a genuine UFO. It had a huge window in front, through which Alois could see two strange-looking short figures with bald heads, pointed ears, big noses and gray wrinkled skin.

1977, TUCSON, AZ: Running outside their home, Lois Stovall and her grandmother, Alice were amazed to see a tiny capsule-shaped UFO with a child-sized figure standing up inside it. It was so close, they could almost touch it. They watched it swoop up into the sky while nearby helicopters searched for it.

1977, DORSET, ENGLAND: Ethel May Field went outside to take the laundry off the clothesline when suddenly a large craft swooped down and tilted towards her. Inside, through a large window, she saw two human-looking ETs. And one of them was looking down and pointing right at her.

1979, SAN FERNANDO, CA: When an intense UFO wave strikes the area, dozens of people report low-flying craft. Two witnesses have a craft approach so close to them that they can clearly see two humanoid figures looking down at them through the window of the craft.

1983, MOBILE, AL: Driving off Highway 90 to her home, Pat Norris sees a strange light in the forest. Pulling over to get a better look, she sees a massive craft hovering overhead. A long panel window lines the craft allowing her to see dozens of white-suited figures walking gracefully around the craft.

OCT 2003, WESTERVILLE, OH: David Noll and his wife can hardly believe their eyes. Hovering in the sky above their home is a large craft with a humanoid figure inside. When it remains in place, they view the UFO through binoculars and can see that the figure is wearing a light-colored one-piece suit.

These 14 cases span six decades and come from across the planet. They provide some profound insights into the UFO phenomenon. They show that it is global, ongoing and incredibly varied with UFO shapes and humanoid types. Most important, they show that UFOs are showing themselves intentionally in what appears to be a publicity campaign announcing their presence. The question is, will we listen?

Saved by aliens! Helped, healed, rescued, there are many cases on record where ETs have intervened to help those in need. While a close encounter can be scary, it can also be a Godsend to those who are in trouble. This video presents a dozen cases in which UFOs and extraterrestrials showed up just in time. These include sightings, face-to-face encounters, landings and onboard UFO experiences. The cases reach back decades. They come from all over the world and have occurred to many all kinds of people. With all the fear and confusion surrounding ET contact, these cases are profoundly important and show that some ETs do have our best interests in mind.

SEP 27, 1959: COOS BAY, OR. Leo Bartsch had been suffering from an undiagnosed problem with his arm, causing pain and numbness. Then, in the middle of the night, he found himself floating above his bed, and sensed that a UFO was over his house. Moments later, he was lowered to his bed, and realized to his delight, that his arm was healed!

1960s: TN. The head of Project Blue Book, Edward Ruppelt reveals that the Blue Book office received a letter from a mountaineer in TN who says that a strange round glowing object came into his living room and healed him of chronic arthritis.

APR 1971: VA. In a letter to NICAP, a prisoner in the Southern Correction Facility in Lucasville, OH related an amazing story of how a UFO may have helped him. The man was being chased by the police when a UFO dropped down from the sky and hovered 150 feet over his head. The prisoner felt a telepathic rapport with the UFO and had a sense of being watched. Then the UFO began to follow him.

SEP 22, 1972: DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. While driving along a remote highway, Virgilio Gomez was flagged down by a gentleman. Exiting his car, he was shocked to see two other tall, strange-looking figures, and behind them along the road, a landed UFO. The man who flagged Virgilio down said his name was Freddie Miller, and that he had been lost at sea 13 years earlier, but was rescued by the ETs.

1979: SOUTH VIETNAM. A soldier and his fellow soldiers had become separated from their main unit and pinned down by a group of Vietcong soldiers. They had given up any chance of getting back to their unit when, without warning, a massive blue saucer hovered over the Vietcong soldiers, causing them to scatter.

1980: THE CARIBBEAN. French singer, Antoine, had moored his boat on a small island. Waking up in the middle of the night, Antoine was horrified to find that his anchor had broken loose, and he was now at the mercy of the waves. He was lost and heading for a coral reef. That’s when a UFO appeared right over his boat, grabbed ahold it with a strange force and pulled it to safety.

APR 10, 1982: COOKE CITY, MT. Snowmobiling in the mountains, Mr. H. was overcome by a blizzard. Looking up, he saw a bright blue sphere overhead. Unable to hear it over the storm, he thought it was a rescue helicopter, especially when it began to lead him out of the wilderness. Instead, it led him to a group of snowmobilers who were lost and needed help.

APR 1983: ALICE SPRINGS, AUSTRALIA. Maggie Hite (age 73) had suffered from arthritis for years when a UFO landed in her backyard. Out stepped short humanoids who escorted her onto their craft and healed her. Her physician was shocked to find her totally healthy.

AUG 1985, MILBANKE SOUND, BC, CANADA. Randy Morrison and Leonard Egolf were sailing in the ocean and got caught in a fierce storm which capsized their boat. They clung to the hull until the waves threw them into the sea. Leonard was never seen again. Randy was on the verge of giving up when a glowing object appeared overhead, giving him encouragement to hang on a little longer.

DEC 1988: WATSONVILLE, CA. When Ann Desoto and her boyfriend encountered a landed UFO, they didn’t realize that they had missing time until they returned home. But Ann did notice a strange mark on her hip. And strangely, the arthritis in her hip had disappeared. Later, under hypnosis, she recalled an onboard experience where she was healed by the grays.

OCT 1989: USA. Retired military officer Dolores Galvin was shocked to see a tall dark figure enter her bedroom and lean over her bed. In his hand he held a strange silver pencil-shaped object, which he applied to her arthritic shoulder. Dolores felt a floating sensation and then passed out. When she awoke, her arthritis was gone.

SEP 27, 1993: CORDILLERA TAJSARA, BOLIVIA. Lost in the mountainous wilderness, hiker Robert Suarez Molina thought he was a goner. Little did he know, rescuers were searching for him and kept seeing unexplained lights. Then Robert himself saw a UFO land. A humanoid exited the craft and let him know he was about to be rescued.

These cases reveal a friendly side to the ETs that is often overlooked and ignored. But the cases speak for themselves. The proof is in the pudding. People do have benevolent encounters.

There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters, and of course, onboard UFO encounters. Of the many kinds of UFO encounters, cases of people going inside UFOs are among the most fascinating. These accounts contain the most information and tell us the most about extraterrestrials and their agenda on this planet.

A wide variety of events occur inside UFOs. While there are patterns, each case seems to contain new and unique details. There are many different types of extraterrestrials. And there are thousands (or perhaps millions) of these cases occurring across the world. Yet still there are more questions than answers.

This video presents six fascinating true accounts of people who have been inside UFOs. Each provides profound insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon and ET contact, and shows exactly what it’s like to experience the closest of all UFO encounters.

CASE ONE: “THE SCENE THAT I SAW WAS HORRIBLE.” In May of 1950, Dr. Enrique Caretuno Botta was driving through the desert in Bahia Blanca, Argentina when he saw a landed silvery saucer by the dirt highway. Exiting his car, he walked up to the craft and saw that a door was opened. Curious, he entered the craft and was horrified to see three dead humanoids. He walked around and inspected the craft for about five minutes, but was freaked out and left. Returning the next day with friends, the craft was gone, leaving a pile of ash. But up above them hovered three UFOs. And Dr. Botta had his camera ready.

CASE TWO: “INSPECTED BY MACHINE-LIKE ALIENS.” Lee Parrish of Prospect, KY was 19-years old when he left his friend’s house at 1:00 a.m., on Jan 27, 1977. It was a short 7-minute drive home. But his journey was interrupted by the arrival of a UFO hovering over his car. He rushed home, only to find that he was missing 35 minutes of time. His eyes were sore and painful, the cigarette he was smoking was missing, and the electrical system of his car went haywire. Realizing his sighting was something more, he went under hypnosis and recalled being lifted into the craft where he encountered strange machine-like ETs who seemed very interested in him.

CASE THREE: “I CAN REMEMBER, BUT CAN’T SAY.” On the evening of Jun 20, 1977, Rachel Jones of Coeur D’Alene, ID woke up and found herself unable to move as a strange figure carried her out of her home. She blacked out and woke up with a bad headache and a weird mark on her shoulder. A short time later, while flying on a jet, she saw unexplained flashes of light and received a strange message of greeting. Realizing that something very strange was happening, she sought out hypnosis. She remembered being taken onboard a craft and undergoing a strange procedure, but she was compelled not to talk about it. At least at first.

CASE FOUR: “I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU.” On Sep 25, 1980, Elias Seixas de Mattos, his cousin Alberto Seixas, and their friend Guaraci Fernandes de Sousa took a thousands-miles-long road trip from Belem to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While on the road, Elias received a weird telepathic message. Stopping their vehicle, the three men encountered a large glowing craft ahead of them on the highway. They then experienced five hours of missing time. Later, under hypnosis, Elias recalled being pulled onboard the craft where he met a seven-foot-tall ET.

CASE FIVE: “SOME WILL BELIEVE YOU, OTHERS WILL NOT.” On the evening of Aug 7, 1983, Julio Platner was opening the gate of a ranch in Winifreda, Argentina when he was struck by a beam of light. The next thing he knew he was lying naked on a table inside a small round room, surrounded by strange hairless humanoids with round bulging eyes. The ETs told him to have no fear, that they had taken thousands of people beside him and would cause no harm. Then began a very strange examination. After a short conversation, Julio was returned, only to find that he was now 8 miles from where he had been taken.

CASE SIX: “WE ONLY WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.” It was a warm evening in Jul 1988 when Carlos Manuel Mercado was woken up by a brilliant light shining into his home in Betances, Puerto Rico. Opening his window, he was shocked to see three hairless humanoids with huge dark eyes standing outside his home. Initially frightened, Carlos was reassured by the figures, who led him outside to a landed craft. The UFO took off towards and nearby mountain range and then traveled underneath it to an apparently underground base. During this time, Carlos met with a tall humanoid who had a special message for him, and a request.

Practically everything we know about UFOs and extraterrestrials comes from the firsthand cases of UFO contactees. And there are now enough cases on record, with all types of physical evidence to prove the reality of UFO contact. These cases leave little doubt that we are being visited and that the Universe is filled with life of all kinds.

UFOs are known for sending brilliant beams of light onto the ground, onto vehicles, and especially onto people. These beams come in many different colors. They can be wide or narrow. And they exhibit many properties that far exceed the capabilities of normal light beams. They heal wounds, cause burns, levitate, paralyze, pull people through solid objects, and much more. They make it very clear that our own understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum remains woefully incomplete.

Why are UFOs sending down these beams of light? How do they produce these amazing effects? What is it like to be “beamed by a UFO?” This video presents ten firsthand accounts, spanning decades and coming from across the planet. They vividly recount people’s experiences of being struck by a UFO beam of light and answer many of the questions surrounding this unique aspect of UFO behavior.

AUG 25, 1972: TITUSVILLE, PA. Driving along Route 408 in Rockdale township, newspaper editor Frank Holowach is puzzled to see a strange twinkling light in the night sky. Frank realizes he is seeing an actual UFO. At first he's excited. But then it moves closer, shines a light on him, and his car begins to vibrate. Then he feels himself vibrating. And when he feels an odd magnetic force pulling on him, he is filled with fear.

FEB 1956: CHOISY-LE-ROI, FRANCE. Mademoiselle Roi is driving along Road 186 when she hears a hissing noise and sees a bright object. She pulls over and sees a landed UFO and short humanoids beneath. She jumps from her car and runs to the ETs, trying to grab one of them. Then a beam comes from the craft and strikes her, paralyzing her.

APR 1960: PUY-DE-DOME, FRANCE. Baker and former Air Force officer Germain Tichit is drawn outside by colored lights and a loud noise. Going to investigate, he sees a landed UFO. A small figure emerges. Realizing that it's an ET, he lunges forward to capture it. The ET whips out a tubular device and points it at Germain, striking him with a laser-like beam of light.

OCT 30, 1967: BOYUP BROOK, AUSTRALIA. It was 9:20 p.m., as Alexander Spargo drives at 65 mph along the Kojonup-Mayanup Road. Without warning his motor stops, his headlights go out and a brilliant tube of light focuses on him from above. Looking up he sees a huge saucer. To his shock, his car has come to a complete stop. And when the beam retracts, he is shocked to see that his car is racing along the road.

APR 5, 1974: MOUNT OLIVE, NC. Newspaper reporter Nelson Bland had heard about recent sightings in the area, but driving along Hwy 117, he is shocked to see a strange pulsating light in the sky. As it zooms closer, he sees a classic flying saucer. He grabs his camera and is about to take a photo when he is engulfed by a brilliant beam of light. “I almost fainted,” he said.

May 26, 1977: SALISBURY NORTH, AUSTRALIA. When three teenagers go biking in the fields behind their homes, they have no idea that they are about to have an unforgettable encounter with a UFO. After setting down their bikes in a creek-bed, a beam of light shines down on their bikes, causing them to glow. One boy jumps forward and touches the beam. He is thrown to the ground by the beam. The other two boys dive for cover. 

SEP 1978: DILHORNE, ENGLAND. It was 1:30 a.m., and Stephen Colclough and his girlfriend are driving along a country road and see a strange red and white lights in the sky. Without warning, a huge black object looms in front of them and strikes them with a powerful searchlight. Says Stephen, “It was absolutely terrifying.”

SEP 10, 1981: PLYMOUTH ENGLAND. As Denise Bishop steps into her apartment, she looks up and ses a massive UFO shining down colorful beams of light. She is entranced by its beauty, but realizing it's a UFO, she turns to rush inside. The UFO sends down a pencil-thin green beam of light, striking her hand, stopping her in her tracks. As it retracts, she runs inside. Then she sees the burn-mark on her hand.

NOV 28, 1981: STARKS, ME. Kenos Henry drives to his home when he saw a UFO. It sends down a thin beam of red light into his eyes. As he rushes away, the craft follows. Later that night, Harold Hendsbee and his wife are confronted by a UFO which blocks the road and strikes them with a brilliant light. The UFO wave in Starks, Maine has just begun.

JAN 8, 1984: FRAMINGHAM, MA. An anonymous witness wakes up in bed to a startling sight. A mysterious green shaft of light is shining in his window, aimed directly into his right eye, causing heat and pain. He hears a strange whirring sound and sees the faint outline of a being.

These cases show how powerful these beams of light can be. They show that the ETs have a profound understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum, and they know how to use it to do things that border on the miraculous. Cases like these have much to teach us about light, and about how ETs behave, and their agenda on our planet.

UFOs can have many weird effects. They provoke strange alterations in plants. They cause bizarre electromagnetic disturbances in machines. They create a wide variety of landing traces. They make animals behave in weird and unusual ways. They affect people physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. When UFOs show up, almost anything can happen. This video presents a dozen cases spanning four decades and occurring to all kinds of people from all over the world.
 
Apr 24, 1954: Buyere, France. Two lumberjacks, Roger Mougeolle and Gilbert Doridant see three huge metallic UFOs. One of them lands in a field. Gilbert runs away in fear, but Roger walks up and taps it with his axe. He then raises his axe and strikes it. He is promptly thrown to the ground and temporarily paralyzed.

Aug 16, 1965: Montes Claros, Brazil. When 32-year-old banker, Filomeno Bido de Oliveira goes fishing one evening, a UFO drops down and hovers 150 feet overhead. After it leaves, Filomeno body reacts strangely. Although he felt no fear during the encounter, his heart is racing, and he urinated in his pants. The next day, his entire body is weirdly numb.

Feb 14, 1967: Miller County, MO. Early in the morning, a farmer sees a domed-shaped object with colored lights in his field. Strange-looking figures stand beneath it. He picks up two rocks and tosses them at the craft. Inexplicably, the rocks hit an invisible barrier and fall to the ground. As the witness approaches closer, he hits the invisible barrier himself.

Nov 25, 1968: Necochea, Argentina. Local farmers are concerned when they see UFOs and then find burned circles in their fields. Even stranger is the appearance of many giant-sized mushrooms outside the circles. They grow so quickly that some soon reach the size of footballs, two feet across and one foot high.

Jan 29, 1969: Matadepera, Spain. An 80-year-old woman is picking wild herbs when a weird metallic craft emerges from the trees, swoops below the powerlines and zooms off. Returning to the site with investigators, they discover four tunnels dug horizontally into the ground in a weird pattern, and in a way no animal or known machine could do.

Jul 20, 1971: Vitry-en-Artois, France. Monsieur F. Laisne was outside his home and sees a large spherical object move over his own house to a tall poplar tree. The object emits brilliant lights, snapping off a branch from the tree. As it moves away, his dog barks, his cows scatter, a railway near his home sparks, and his alarm clocks in the house all stop.

Aug 1971: Sarcee, Canada. An doctor is horseback riding when his horse becomes agitated. A saucer-shaped object swoops down, causing the horse to panic. After the object leaves, the horse remains shy and nervous. In the days that follow, his own horse develops a strange illness.

Jul 31, 1975: Loxton, South Africa. Danie Van Graan is checking on his sheep and sees a landed UFO and occupants. Getting closer, he is struck by a beam of light, causing a choking sensation, a nosebleed and vomiting. Van Graan then realizes his eyesight has also been affected. At the landing cite are weird landing impressions and a strange green substance.

Oct 5, 1978: Wellingborough, England. When many witnesses across town report a low-flying craft, it’s clear that something strange is going on. Then15-year-old Caroline Muncey and her friend Mandy are walking home, the UFO swoops down and chases them down the street. Afterwards, Caroline finds a strange rash on her hands and arms.

Aug 1979: Oktyabrskiy, Russia. A team of eight oil-field workers are terrified when a UFO lands on their worksite. Going to investigate the next morning, they find three deep marks in a triangular formation on the ground. In the center is a hole reaching 100 feet in depth.

Late 1980: Frankfurt, Germany. When a crew of a 707 jet leaves New York for Frankfurt, they are tailed by a saucer which illuminates the interior of their cockpit. It’s caught on radar and viewed from the ground. Afterward, the captain begins having nightmares of weird alien creatures.

Feb 1981: Mojave Desert, CA. A prospector returns from a trip into the desert with an incredible story of a UFO landing. After it takes off, he notices weird silvery spheres which glowed for two days afterwards. He picks up one of the stones, which shows many unusual properties. When it’s analyzed by scientists, it defies identification. Only later do they discover its strange composition.

These cases reveal some important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. They show that UFOs are visiting many locations on our planet for a long period of time. They show that UFOs can affect the soil, the vegetation, animal life, machines and most importantly, humans…all in a wide variety of unexpected ways. They show that the ETs display an interest in all things Earth and all things human. And they also provide compelling evidence for the reality of UFOs.

EXTRAORDINARY EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENCOUNTERS: TEN TRUE CASES OF LANDINGS AND HUMANOIDS</a>.</h3>

All types of UFO encounters are important and add to our knowledge of this very complex subject. Among the most extraordinary are cases of UFO landings and face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials. Sightings don’t contain very much data, and the onboard UFO experience often has the issues of missing time, hypnotically-recalled memories, not to mention the fear and trauma that often comes with it. Cases involving landings and humanoids, however, belong to a unique category of encounters that allows witnesses to experience the phenomenon directly and without the issues of missing time.

Here are ten extraordinary cases of alien meetings from across the planet. They reach back into the 1950s and continue up to the 1980s. Most involve multiple witnesses. Many involve compelling physical evidence such as animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and even landing traces. Most remarkable is the huge variety of humanoids seen, short and tall, skinny and wide, with variations in appearance, clothing and the craft they fly. Each case also contains unique elements in the way the ETs behave. Together they have much to tell us about the nature and origin of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial agenda on our planet.

MICHELIN MAN ETS. May 14, 1955, Monsieur Droguet, a professor at the College for Girls in Dinan, France was entering his home when he was struck by a beam of light. Looking up, he saw a saucer-shaped object and right below it, two strange humanoids, both dressed in uniforms like the Michelin Man seen on TV. One walked up to the college and peered in one of the windows.

SWIMMING ETS. Aug 1, 1962, three sailors in two boats were in the Mediterranean Sea and saw what they thought was a foreign submarine. Then, nearly a dozen figures in weird wetsuits emerged and climbed onto the “sub.” Moments later it rose from the sea to reveal itself to be a flying saucer.

CAR-JACKING EXTRATERRESTRIAL. Nov 2, 1967, Guy Tossie and Will Begay drove on Highway 26 at Ririe, ID when a saucer dropped down in front of them blocking their way. Inside they saw two strange humanoids. One floated to the car, opened the door and got in the driver’s seat, steering the car into a field. One of the men ran away in fear while the other stayed in the car with the ET.

THEY LOOKED LIKE SAINTS. Jan 1968, a family in Lagoa Negra, Brazil was confronted by a landed saucer on their property. Two tall human-looking figures exited the craft, followed by shorter figures. The short ETs stayed by the craft while the tall ones approached the household, close enough for the witnesses to see them clearly. To their shock, the ETs looked like saints.

THE MILAKOVIC FAMILY ENCOUNTER. Nov 20, 1968, Milin Milokovac, his wife Doris, and their young son went house-hunting in Hanbury, England. Instead, they were amazed to see a huge craft rise up from a field and move over their car. Even more extraordinary, looking through the transparent canopy of the craft, they saw several human-looking figures.

TEN-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS. On Apr 14, 1971, Dennis Donaldson and Marion Lang were driving through Callery, PA and saw a bright light pacing their car. As it darted around, it came very low and close, revealing itself to be a metallic craft. The couple pulled over to get a closer-look and were awed to see windows in the craft and two 10-foot-tall humanoids.

ETS IN THE FRONT YARD. Jun 9, 1971, Esther Clappison stepped out of her home in Rosedale, Alberta, Canada and saw a weird craft landed only 200 from her home. It had a huge picture window through which she could see two strangely dressed figures. Outside the craft, another figure was picked up stones.

MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOIDS. Jun 19, 1979, Allan and Maila of Rauma, Finland saw a tiny saucer-shaped object landed next to their home. Maila went outside and walked up to the craft. Inside, she saw two tiny humanoids busy with a control console. As she reached out to tap on the craft, the humanoids both turned to look at her.

THE RUNNING ALIENS. Jul 25, 1979, Federico Ibanez went to pick grapes from his vineyard in Turis, Spain and drove up to a landed UFO. Staring in shock, he saw two oddly-dressed humanoids running at high speed from behind a tree and into the craft.
 
IT FOLLOWED US HOME. Dec 29, 1981, two boys from Onsted, MI were playing in their backyard when a UFO hovered overhead. Then a humanoid came floating toward them. They ran away in fear, only to find that the humanoid followed them. It was to be an encounter that would affect them profoundly for a long time afterwards.

As extraordinary and bizarre as these cases may appear, they are all true, fully investigated and often supported by multiple witnesses and physical evidence. Although each case is different, they also share remarkable commonalities which lend an additional level of corroboration. Mostly they show how truly extraordinary the UFO phenomenon is.

There are many strange patterns to UFO activity, and one of them appears to be a connection to the food crop, alfalfa. There are dozens of cases in which UFOs are seen over alfalfa fields. These are not only low-level sightings, but landings and humanoid encounters. They have been occurring since the modern age of UFOs and continue today.

The question is why? What is it about alfalfa that is attracting so many UFOs? This video presents a chronology of cases from all over the world. Most of these cases involve physical evidence such as animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances, and most often: landing traces. These cases not only provide outstanding evidence of UFO reality, they provide some startling insights into ET behavior.

Jan 1950: Rosamond CA. The Gettys family is startled when as UFO hovers at low level over their alfalfa farm, causing all kinds of unusual effects.

Dec 1953: Tome, NM. Farmer Julian Torres and his wife are drawn outside by their barking dogs, only to see a 14-foot wide-glowing object hovering only a few feet above their alfalfa fields.

Sep 1962: Orland, CA. Rancher A.T. Gray goes to investigate what he first thought were two cars parked in an alfalfa field, only to realize it was a UFO shining down beams onto the plants.

Dec 1965: Tucuman, Argentina. Farmer Antonio Lozano watches a glowing red object land in his field, leaving behind a 15-foot-wide burned circle in his alfalfa field.

Mar 1969: Marshall, MI. It was a sunny morning when Wayne Kidder and his family saw a dome-shaped object parked in their alfalfa field. It stayed for 20 minutes when it disappeared suddenly.

Aug 1970: Vallodolid, Spain. Mrs. C.R. is drawn outside by an eerie whistling noise to see a landed metallic craft. Standing next to it is a uniformed humanoid staring intently at their alfalfa fields.

Sep 1974: Sioux City, IA: George Hoffman steps outside his farmhouse and sees a glowing object darting low over his alfalfa fields. Inspecting the area, he finds a semi-circle of burned vegetation.

Aug 1975: Rochester, MN. When numerous residents see a UFO land at a local alfalfa farm, an inspection of the area reveals a strange landing trace shows exposure to a very high heat source.

Sep 1975: Starbuck, MN. Farmer Gordon Hovendick usually grew corn, but this year decided to grow alfalfa. When harvesting his crop, he discovers numerous strange rings of burned vegetation in his fields.

Aug 1977: Arthur, NB. When Janet Magnuson and her cousin have a close-up encounter with a UFO, an investigation reveals a burned circle in a nearby alfalfa field.

Oct 1980: Orbisonia, PA. An anonymous witness is picking alfalfa for her rabbits when a UFO hovers low overhead. She brings the alfalfa home, but her rabbits refuse to eat it.

Jan 1981: Trans-en-Provence, France. Retired stonemason Renato Nicolai encounters a landed UFO in the wild alfalfa next to his house, leading to one of the most well-verified UFO landing trace cases on record.

Oct 1984: Prato di Principato, Italy. Alfalfa farmer Giuseppe Cocozza is checking his fields when he comes upon a 3-foot-tall humanoid holding a strange instrument and poking it into the ground. When the figure notices Giuseppe, it flees towards an oddly-shaped craft landed nearby.

Aug 1988: Elmwood, WI: Farmers Charles and Evelyn Hutchins are shocked to find strange circular rings in their alfalfa fields, only to learn that their neighbor had seen UFOs in the area.

Oct 1990: Barada, NB: Charlie Kirkendall is cutting his alfalfa fields and discovers two mysterious circles burned into his field. Neighbors flock to his field to see, when word spreads that some of the neighbors in the area have been seeing strange lights at night.

Aug 1992: Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Phyllis Collins finds a nine-foot-diameter circle of flattened alfalfa in her fields and calls in an agricultural scientist to investigate, who informs her that he has been studying numerous similar circles made recently in the surrounding areas.

Aug 2000: Kondoros, Hungary. An anonymous farmer is driving his tractor through his alfalfa fields when he is confronted by a short humanoid figure less than feet tall who fearlessly approaches him.

As these cases (and many others) show, ETs are attracted to alfalfa. Could it be that they recognize its value as a food source, rich in vitamins and useful for its many medicinal properties? It certainly looks that way! Whatever the reason, the connection between UFOs and alfalfa is undeniable. There are too many cases to ignore. ETs love alfalfa!

People from all levels of society encounter UFOs, and that includes the rich and famous. In fact, there is a very long list of celebrities who have come forward revealing their own dramatic UFO encounters. Actors, musicians, sports stars -- there are now about 100 cases of celebrity UFO encounters, and the list is growing fast. Here are some new ones that you may not have heard of.

JOHNNY CASH: In Feb 1981, world-famous musician Johnny Cash was in Jamaica when he had a dramatic UFO encounter. It was a clear night, and he was outside with a group of people. Suddenly a bright streaking light caught his eye. He first thought it was a shooting star. But then he saw it was oval in shape, purple in color, and was making a strange noise. As Johnny says, “It was unearthly.”

RONNIE JAMES DIO: One of the most influential heavy metal vocalists of all times, (heading such bands as Black Sabbath and Deep Purple) Ronnie is also a UFO witness. In 1978, Ronnie and his wife Donna were in their home in New Canaan, CT when they saw an enormous globe of white light. They first thought it was the moon, but then it started to move closer. “That was the presence of a UFO,” Dio says, “and we were blown away.”

ROMA DOWNEY: Best known for her starring role in “Touched by an Angel,” Roma Downey has also been touched by an alien. While in Joshua Tree, CA on Oct 21, 2020, Roma and others saw several glowing objects. When they stayed in the sky, they actually filmed one of the objects. “Something has appeared in the skies over Joshua Tree,” Roma writes, “but what is it?”

DARRELL EVANS: Baseball superstar Darrell Evans was playing for the Detroit Tigers when, in June of 1982, he and his wife LaDonna viewed a close-up UFO hover by their home in Pleasanton, CA. The object was silent, metallic, glowing and less than 200 feet away. “It was as if they wanted us to see them,” Darrell says, “as if they had singled us out.”

GIGI HADID: Super-model Gigi Hadid stunned the world when, in 2017, she described her sighting of a UFO while driving through the deserts of California. She (and others) saw a strange “bright light" in the sky. She called the experience “crazy” and “life-changing,” and now has a strong interest in the subject of UFOs.

REINHOLD MESSNER: The most famous mountain climber in the world, it should come as no surprise that Reinhold has joined the ranks of celebrity UFO witnesses. While climbing Mount Chamblang in the Himalayas, he and climbing partner Doug Scott saw a glowing UFO for a period of three hours! Reinhold says that the object was “the size of a full moon.” Doug says “The movements of this object were irregular.”

DOUG PINNICK. Lead singer for the heavy metal band, Kings X, Doug Pinnick shocked the world when he said, “I was abducted by an alien.” One night, at age three, a beautiful man “like Jesus” appeared in the bedroom of his home in Braidwood, IL. He was led outside where he saw other similar figures. A bright light shone down and lifted him up into the sky. Years later, watching Ancient Aliens, he saw drawings of the same exact beings.

WILL SMITH: One of the most successful actors of modern times, Oscar-winner Will Smith has starred in a long list of blockbuster movies such as Independence Day, Men in Black and others. One night while driving with a friend through the Nevada desert, he saw a hovering white light, which swooped down in front of his vehicle and disappeared. “I was scared,” Will admitted. “I think there has to be something out there.”

DENNIS WEAVER: Award-winning actor Dennis Weaver is best known for his role in the TV series, McCloud. In March 1986, he and his wife Gerry had a close-up sighting of a metallic cigar-shaped object over their home in Ridgway, CO. “We just stood there and stared at it,” said Dennis. “It was certainly something that was totally unidentified, something I’d never seen before.”

KIM WILDE: Creator of the mega-hit, “We’re the Kids in America,” UK-popstar Kim Wilde saw a bright darting light over her home. “It was a UFO,” she says. “I can’t believe it.” She was so impressed, she titled her new album, “Here Come the Aliens.”

CINDY WILLIAMS: Comedic actress Cindy Williams was the co-star of the sit-com, Laverne & Shirley, which was at one point, the single most popular show on television. While in San Bernardino, CA, Cindy and others saw a fleet of orange and purple discs zooming across the sky. Says Cindy, “It was like they were trying to announce their presence to us.”

As can be seen, the UFO occupants visit all kinds of people on our planet, regardless of age, ancestry, religion, sex, occupation, location, education…etc. Or could it be that they are visiting famous people intentionally, putting on a display in the hopes that celebrities will come forward and use their platform to tell the world that UFOs are real?

If there is one word that sums up the UFO experience, it’s “phantasmagorical.” Whether a sighting, a landing, a face-to-face encounter, an onboard experience, or even a UFO crash/retrieval -- all of them contain levels of weirdness and high strangeness that are a consistent feature of UFO cases. The variety of UFO experiences are truly astonishing. They can be funny, bizarre, scary, traumatizing, enlightening, healing and more.

This video presents twelve cases which show just how truly weird and freaky the UFO experience can be. These cases come from across the United States and the world. Most involve multiple witnesses and varying kinds of physical evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, physiological effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Each provides another piece of the puzzle towards solving the UFO mystery.

CASE 1: ET LEADS MAN TO WATER. In 1970, Wyoming rancher Pat McGuire became the laughing-stock of his community when he purchased a 6500-acre ranch in arid desert land and said he was going to grow crops there, something nobody else had done. But Pat had a secret, he was in contact with ETs, and they told him exactly where to dig his well.

CASE 2: ALIEN FISHERMEN. On Nov 2, 1972, Monsieur Vuillien of Doucier, France was shocked when a UFO drops down and hovers a mere 20 feet over his fish ponds where he’s raising 50,000 trout. Then the object begins to move closer, so he retrieves his gun and gets ready for a confrontation.

CASE 3: THE UFO & THE WASHING-MACHINE. The year of 1978 was a busy one for Evelyn Whiteway of Parson Cross, England. After two sightings earlier in the year, Evelyn had a third one. But this time it hovers over her house and causes a bizarre effect on her washing machine. And after that, the UFOs return!

CASE 4: THE ALIEN CHOCOLATE BAR. On the morning of Feb 28, 1974, a factory worker from Origney-En-Thierache, France is driving his moped to work when a UFO lands next to him, and out step two figures dressed in spacesuits. They stop his moped and hand him what looks like a chocolate bar, motioning for him to eat it. He is unable to resist and puts it in his mouth.

CASE 5: PAPERBOY SEES A UFO CRASH. On Feb 17, 1979, while delivering papers near his home in Tucson, AZ, 10-year-old Warren Weisman sees a small glowing object crash to the ground in front of him, damaging a car and mailbox. As he’s inspecting the weird metallic-looking object, a man-in-black shows up and suggests that he leave the area.

CASE 6: A UFO MAKES A FAMILY DIZZY. On Mar 11, 1979, while driving along Ware Road in Hertford, England, Alice Ball and her family stop the car to observe a glowing UFO. As it moves over the car, they experience several very strange physical effects.

CASE 7: THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FROM A UFO. While walking his dog on the evening of Nov 21, 1980, near his home in Burneside, England, Mario Luisi comes upon a landed UFO. Out step two of the most beautiful people he has ever seen. And they want to talk to him.

CASE 8: A BOY SHOOTS AN ALIEN. On Mar 11, 1981, Cathy Gilpin and her 19-year-old son Arlin of Casey County, KY are drawn outside by a strange noise. Seeing a glowing object, they go to investigate. Cathy drives towards it, and feels a strange force pulling her to the object. She flees the scene, but Arlin goes outside with a gun and comes face-to-face with a 7-foot creature.

CASE 9: A UFO ROADBLOCK. Late at night in Feb 1983, Ante Jonsson was returning to his home in Tyngsrud, Sweden and saw what looked like a child on the road. Looking up, he saw a huge UFO. It darted away. Ante went home to get his camera and returned to the scene. The UFO was gone, but then it landed in the road. ETs came out and surrounded his car. 

CASE 10: UFOS SUCK WATER FROM POOLS. In Jan 1984, many residents of Olavarria, Argentina observe a UFO hover over their swimming pools and suck the water right out of them. And this isn’t the first time this has happened.

CASE 11: A UFO MADE HIM PSYCHIC. In 1988, Stuart (a teacher in Mutare, Africa) was walking through a field when a UFO hovered low overhead. Time seemed to move in slow-motion as he fled the scene. After the sighting: he started predicting the future.

CASE 12: PINEAPPLE PINCHING ALIENS. In the late 1980s, pineapple farmer Harry Roy heard a loud thumping noise coming from his pineapple fields in Caloundra, Australia. Going to investigate, he saw something that they couldn’t believe or understand. They had just planted 15,000 pineapple plants. Every single one of them were gone. 

As these cases show, just when you think you’ve heard everything about UFOs, another case comes along and makes you realize that we still have much to learn about UFOs and the ETs visiting our planet. They show that not only are we NOT alone in this universe, but that extraterrestrials are intervening on many levels. There are too many cases to ignore. The truth is coming out!

There is no experience quite like an onboard UFO encounter. A simple sighting is undeniably interesting, but often they can be misperceived and misinterpreted. Even UFO landings and face-to-face encounters tell us nothing about what it’s like inside a craft. Onboard UFO encounters are so close-up that it’s virtually impossible to misperceive the experience. Witnesses are not only touching the UFO, they are breathing the air inside it, smelling the odors, hearing the sounds, and communicating directly with the extraterrestrials. It is cases like these where we learn the most about ETs, who they are, where they come from, why they are here and their agenda on our planet.

Cases of people being taken onboard are far more numerous than most people realize. In fact, many researchers believe that millions of people are having these experiences. They’ve been taking place for many years and occur all over the world.

This video (and article) present ten cases of people who have had this astonishing type of encounter. Many of these are multiple witness cases involving physical evidence such as landing traces, EM disturbances and medical effects, both injuries and healings. They show remarkable commonalities, and also unique features. In some of the cases, the witnesses were able to hold long interactive conversations with the ETs and learned a great deal of information.

CASE 1: BARBARA SCHUTTE. After attending a UFO convention in 1981, Barbara Schutte of Wever, Iowa learned that she herself was having UFO experiences. After undergoing hypnosis, she learned she was a lifelong abductee and was given an important life mission by the ETs to help educate the world about UFOs.

CASE 2: CYNTHIA VODOVOZ. In Oct 1973, Cynthia Vodovoz (age 12) was driving with her mother to ballet class in Birmingham, AL when they had a missing time UFO encounter. Later, under hypnosis, Cynthia recalled being pulled onboard and examined. It was to be the first of many other encounters.

 CASE 3: MARTHA THRONE. While driving with her husband, Ernest in Sonora, CA, on Oct 30, 1977, Martha Throne was floated out of her car and into a UFO. She was physically examined by human-looking ETs, and was amazed to see hundreds of ETs onboard. The experience was profoundly benevolent and was spiritually transforming.

CASE 4: PATRICK EUDY. It was Mar 9, 1979. Driving near his home in Monroe, NC, Patrick Eudy found himself and his car being sucked up into a craft. Inside, he was examined by ETs, and was later taken to the control room. Looking out a window, he saw the Earth far below him. He was returned to a location many miles away with almost no memory of the event. It wasn’t until 2 years later that he went under hypnosis and learned what had happened to him.

CASE 5: LULI OSWALD & FAUZE MEHLEN. On Oct 15, 1979, Luli Oswald and her student Fauze Mehlen were pulled onboard a craft and examined by short beings with a “rat-like” appearance. They told Luli they had contacted her because of her abilities with ESP. The ETs seemed most interested in Fauze and told Luli that she was of no use to them.

CASE 6: MEGAN & RENEE ELLIOTT. On Aug 21, 1980, Megan Elliott and her daughter (age 1 ½) were driving near Lake Fork Creek in TX, when they were pulled with their car into a craft. Megan was examined and her daughter was healed of two illnesses. The ETs brought them to another room and gave them strange pellets of food. They then answered many of Megan’s questions about who the ETs are and why they had taken her.

CASE 7: RUBEN MENESES. It was Oct 15, 1981 when truckdriver Ruben Meneses was pulled with his truck into a craft. Ruben was badly traumatized and after being released from the craft many miles away, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Since the encounter, he suffers from light sensitivity.

CASE 8: VIV HAYWARD, ROSEMARY HAWKINS & VALERIE WALTERS. After a night at the disco, three friends, Viv Hayward, Rosemary Hawkins and Valerie Watkins drove home and experienced 20 minutes of missing time. Under hypnosis, they recalled that they were taken together onboard a craft.

CASE 9: INDU SHAH. In 1985, while hiking near the Ganges River in Bihar, India, 17-year-old Indu Shah was missing for 3 days. She was found wandering dazed and disoriented with burns on her skin. Under hypnosis, she recalled a harrowing onboard experience with strange ETs.

CASE 10: ANGELO & GRACIA RICCI. While picnicking near Cadore in the Italian Alps on Aug 15, 1986, Angelo and Gracia Ricci watched a UFO land next to them. 7-foot-tall ETs came out and carried them onboard and gave them a strange exam.

Ten cases, from all across the planet, each providing profound insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon, and each adding another piece of the puzzle to solving the UFO mystery. Cases like these are impossible to deny. They leave no doubt that we are being visited, that we are not alone in this amazing infinite universe.

Among the most spectacular of all UFO encounters are cases of landings and humanoids. These cases are not nearly as common as sightings, and yet they have been occurring all over the world for many decades. Encounters like these are very important because they are so close that any explanations of misperceptions or hallucinations become completely untenable. These cases also remove any doubt that UFOs are in fact craft occupied by living beings. These are the kinds of cases that answer many of the questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon, such as what are they, where do they come from and why are they here?

This video presents seven dramatic cases, one from each decade, starting in the 1950s and moving forward to the 2010s. Each case involves a landed craft and humanoid figure. These cases also provide considerable physical evidence in the form of landing traces, physiological effects and even photographs.

Aug 25, 1952: Musician William Squyres of Frontenac, KS was driving to work early in the morning when he saw a metallic craft with portholes hovering alongside the road. To his amazement, he could see a humanoid figure in the front of the craft. When he shut his car door to get a closer look, the craft zoomed upward and was gone. He called the police and they returned to the site where they found landing traces. Project Blue Book came to investigate. They were unable to explain what he saw and officially declared the case UNIDENTIFIED.

Jul 21, 1967: Ronnie Hill (age 14) was in his backyard in Oriental, NC when a strange odor filled the air and the animals became deathly quiet. Looking up, he saw a UFO. Moments later, a smaller 9-foot white sphere began darting around. Ronnie dashed inside and retrieved his camera. Coming back outside, he saw that the sphere had landed. Then, to his shock, a small humanoid figure stepped out from behind the craft. Ronnie quickly snapped a photograph.

Jan 27, 1978: It was nighttime when four teenagers trespassed onto a farmer’s property in Frodsham, England to go pheasant hunting. As they hid in the undergrowth, they were baffled by the appearance of a metallic craft floating just above the nearby River Weaver. Without warning, the craft moved toward them and landed in a field a short distance away. A herd of cows became immobilized. The boys watched in fear as two humanoids exited the craft and walked up to one of the cows, placing a weird cage-like device around it. Fearing that they were next, the boys fled. Each experienced a strange and unusual physiological reaction as they ran away.

Mar 22, 1982, Donald Shallcross had just returned to his home in Slanesville, WV in the wee hours of the morning when his pets started acting up. Venturing outside, he saw what he thought was a plane about to crash in the fields near his house. Informing his family, he went to go help. Instead of a plane, however, he came upon a landed UFO and was confronted by a strange helmeted humanoid. The figure said he was a watchguard and had some important messages for all humanity.

Mar 6, 1996: Lloyd Karambakuwa (age 17) was woken up in his home in Chipadze, South Africa by a loud clicking noise. Going outside to investigate, he was frightened to see a short glowing figure with a strange uniform and odd-shaped head moving quickly around the property across the street. Realizing it wasn’t human, he ran back inside. Unknown to him, a nearby security guard was also drawn outside by the same weird noise, and also saw the figure. The next morning, Lloyd found very strange footprints at the site.

Mar 2001: After a day of fishing on the River Tocantins in Brazil, Vinicius DaSilva and Marta Rosenthal were driving home when they thought they had a flat tire. Strangely, nothing was wrong. But then Marta pointed to the right over the river where a large craft was hovering just above the river’s surface. A humanoid stood on a ledge and a hose-like device extended down into the water. It appeared to be sucking water up into the craft.

2011: World-famous archaeologist Klaus Honninger, his wife and several others were conducting a dig in the Ocucaje desert in Ica, Peru when a large UFO rose up from behind a hill and began to emit smaller orb-like spheres. After a few moments, the orbs returned into the craft which disappeared behind a hill. It apparently landed, because minutes later, Klaus was confronted by two tall humanoids with elongated skulls. They told Klaus to have no fear, that they had been on Earth long before humans were here, and they had an important message to share. Afterward, Klaus was able to actually photograph the object as it moved away.

Each of these cases provides a fascinating glimpse into the UFO phenomenon, providing both evidence of ET reality, and also warnings from the ETs themselves about how we are treating each other and our planet. With many thousands of cases like these, it’s clear that we are not alone.

Imagine you’re driving along a remote highway late at night when you see a glowing object ahead of you right above the road. As you approach, you can see that it’s actually a saucer-shaped craft, a UFO! Suddenly, the UFO swoops down towards your car and starts following you down the highway. It circles around your car, hovering right above it, on either side, coming closer and closer. Your radio becomes filled with static, your headlights dim, and the car engine begins to sputter. Then the UFO takes control of the car!

This may sound incredible, but it happens more often than you might think. In fact, there are hundreds of UFO-car chases on record, coming from all over the world. These are among the most dramatic of UFO encounters. They have been occurring since at least the 1950s up to the present day. For some reason, UFOs love to play cat-and-mouse games with unwary drivers who suddenly find themselves driving fast and furiously to outrun a UFO that chases them down the highway, sometimes for hours!

The question is why? What exactly is it about people driving cars down highways late at night that attracts so many UFOs? This video presents dozens of cases of UFO car chases, from the 1950s onward, and coming from all across the planet. Here are a few of them.

1952: Gene Povey and two others are driving through the remote Storms River Pass in south Africa. Coming around a corner, they see a UFO blocking the road. The UFO zooms toward the car, forcing the driver to swerve to avoid it. The interior of the car lights up as bright as day. The UFO darts off, but little do they know their encounter has only just begun.

1967: A bus-driver is hauling a load of titanium along the A32 Highway near Reading, England. Without warning the engine to his bus dies. He notices a large object hovering above the road ahead of him. He gets the engine started and moves forward when the engine dies again. The object is now much closer. Afterward, the man’s hands and fingers are numb and a persistent toothache disappears.

1970: Reidar Salvesen is driving late at night to Kristiansand, Norway when a UFO approaches and swoops down ahead of him. He stops the car to observe when the craft zooms forward and hovers right over the hood. He falls to the ground, the windshield shatters and the object lifts up. Afterwards, his vision is altered, his mouth and tongue are numb, and the skin on his hands is burned to the point of peeling.

1972: The Hall family is returning to their home in Thief River Falls, MN. Mr. Hall notices a light pacing their car. They use a flashlight to blink at the craft, and it starts blinking back at them! Then, the object zooms towards their car, sending down a beam of light on them. The radio quits, the engine starts coughing, and a powerful heat envelops the witnesses. Mrs. Hall, who had a bad cold, realizes that her cold is gone!

1978: Three truckers are driving along the I-70 near Indianapolis, IN when a brilliant blue-white light shines down from above, causing all three truck engines to sputter. The beam lasts for about five seconds, then disappears. But when one of the trucks calls out on the CB, “Hey, UFO, if you have your ears on, I want to go with you,” the beam of light returns. The incident is witnessed by more than 100 people!

1981: Linda Brown and two others are driving along the I-93 near Meredith, NH when they notice a UFO pacing their car. Scared, they exit the freeway and drive to a gas-station. The UFO follows and drops down to 100 feet right over the station, where it hovers in place. After ten minutes, Linda drives away, and the UFO continues to follow them.

1982: Frances Collins and Maggie Yeend are driving late at night along the remote South Coast Highway in Australia. Suddenly an object drops down from the sky right in front of their car and zooms towards them in a collision course. For the next hour, the object follows them down the highway, scaring the daylight out of them.

1984: Carolyn Green and her son Timothy are driving along Highway 85 in Seven Points, TX when a UFO appears overhead and begins to wreak havoc with their car. The lights of their car begin flashing on and off by themselves and the UFO appears to take control of the car, which is now driving by itself.

1985: Ezio Zuliani, his wife and son notice a strange light following their car as they travel to their home in Bergamo, Italy. The object follows them for three hours, getting closer and closer. When they pull into a gas station, the object drops down and hovers right above them, in full view of several witnesses. When they leave the station, the object still follows them!

These are just a small sampling of the many cases of UFO-car chases. It appears that the UFO occupants are intentionally chasing cars down highways to announce their presence and let people know they are real! It’s certainly an experience that the witnesses will never forget!

UFO and extraterrestrial encounters are known for their high levels of strangeness. Whether a sighting, a face-to-face encounter with ETs or an onboard experience, each case usually contains unique and unusual elements. Each case adds to our knowledge of alien contact. This article (and video) presents eight cases that illustrate the bizarre high-strangeness of UFO/ET encounters.

CASE ONE: In 1976, Kathleen Teti stepped outside her home in Norristown, PA to an incredible sight. A saucer-shaped craft hovered ten feet above her front yard. The dome atop the craft had huge windows, through which Kathleen could see two gray-type ETs. Even more strange, she saw two humans who had apparently been taken onboard. She was so close, she could see the consoles, chairs, and what appeared to be a red shag rug on the floor and walls!

CASE TWO: In May 1976, Christina Bryant, her daughter and a friend drove late at night on a desert highway outside of Alamogordo, NM. After seeing weird lights overhead, they found themselves on a small dirt road confronted by a strange sight: a uniformed police officer with his cruiser partially overturned in a ditch. The next thing they knew, they were back on the highway missing hours of time. Later under hypnosis, Christina recalled that the policeman was actually an ET, and his cruiser was a landed craft. She and her daughter were both taken onboard.

CASE THREE: On Sep 9, 1976, Bill and Lenda Pecha (and their children) were drawn out of their home in Colusa, CA by a huge craft with blazing bright lights drawing electricity out of the nearby powerlines, causing a power-failure. When the craft came over their house, Bill became alarmed; he could physically feel the electricity coming off the craft. The family ran to their car and drove off in a panic. The UFO chased them all the way to their friend’s house who also saw the object. Meanwhile, other witnesses in town observed the display. A weird after-effect is that the UFO caused a pear-tree which had already borne fruit to blossom again!

CASE FOUR: Florida Malboeuf could hardly believe her eyes when, on Jan 6, 1977, she looked out her apartment window in downtown Montreal, Canada. A metallic, saucer-shaped craft was coming in for a landing on top of the roof of the building across the street. She watched in shock as two humanoids exited the craft and peered over the edge of the building. After the craft took off, her son went to investigate and found a circle of re-frozen ice on the building-top, along with odd child-sized footprints.

CASE FIVE: On Jun 27, 1977, Edna Owens and her four children went shopping at the local market in the small town of Telford, TN. Returning home, they saw what appeared to be a shooting star. But then it began darting around and soon revealed itself to be a flying saucer. When the object came towards them, they fled into the house and turned off all the lights. The object hovered over the house and began circling it. Frightened, the family fled the house. The daughter got an electrical shock when she touched the car door. The family drove off and the object followed. The youngest daughter became so hysterical, she had to be hospitalized for a week.

CASE SIX: On Aug 6, 1977, Tom Dawson of Pelham, GA left his trailer with his dogs to go fishing at the local pond. As soon as he arrived a saucer-shaped craft dropped from the sky and hovered just above the ground. Tom, his dog and a herd of nearby cattle became frozen to the spot. The craft disgorged a half-dozen short, bald, uniformed ETs who began to talk in a foreign language. Two approached Tom and conducted a weird physical exam. The case went from strange to bizarre when a voice came out of the craft, saying the name of a famous labor leader who had mysteriously disappeared a few years earlier.

CASE SEVEN: On Jan 3, 1979, Meagan Quezet and her son Andre were drawn outside their home in Mindalore, Africa by the barking of their dog, Cheeky. Following him down the street, they came upon a landed craft. Out stepped several humanoid figures. They walked around the craft and appeared startled to see they were being observed. One approached Meagan and bowed in greeting. Meagan said, “Hello!”

CASE EIGHT: In mid-Jul 1988, witnesses at a wild animal reserve in Lugo, Spain were shocked to see a 250-foot-long craft with purple lights hover overhead. Without warning it sent down a beam of light onto a herd of elephants. To their absolute astonishment, 26 elephants rose up the beam of light and into the craft, which darted away.

The above cases show how truly strange and bizarre UFO encounters can be. They show that we are not alone in this universe, and that we still have much to learn not only about ourselves, but about the people we share this universe with. Earth is being visited by a wide variety of extraterrestrials. And the UFO contact experience is far more common than many people realize.

Do aliens have a sense of humor? It’s a question many people have asked. And the answer appears to be, yes! In fact, there are many cases where ETs show a sense of humor. There are accounts of ETs smiling, laughing and showing in many ways that they, like humans, do find some things funny. These cases reach back decades and are still occurring today.

Many contactees have seen this firsthand. This video presents more than a dozen cases in which aliens exhibit a sense of humor very much like our own. One example comes from contactee, Bill Foster. After being abducted many times, he wondered how big the craft was. Sometimes it seemed small, and other times large. Finally, he decided to ask how big the craft was. Bill says that the gray seemed to laugh and told him, “It’s as big as we need it to be.” It wasn’t the only time his questions amused the ETs.

In his book, “Secret Life,” researcher David Jacobs Ph.D. presents a case involving a young girl who was taken onboard a craft. During a physical exam, the ETs cut off a lock of her hair and then, in an act of apparent humor, held it up to his bald head and showed it to the other grays! 

In 1910, two witnesses in St. Merryn, Cornwall, England saw a red object hovering in the clouds. Through the portholes of the craft they saw a group of little humanoids chattering and pointing down at the witnesses, laughing.

On Oct 15, 1954, an anonymous gentleman from Shamsabad, Iran saw a “short young man” looking down at him from inside a UFO. The witness was frightened by the sight, but then noticed that the UFO pilot was laughing at him, apparently at the witness’s frightened expression.

A similar case occurred in 1959 in Aubagne, France. Miss Moulet had just gone outside to hang her laundry when an egg-shaped object hovered overhead. Looking down at her through a porthole were about twenty human-looking ETs, smiling and laughing.

A strange case of UFO contact was revealed by John Keel. On Nov 17, 1966, two policemen from Gaffney, South Carolina came upon a landed saucer. Out stepped a short humanoid who began asking them all kinds of question. He seemed puzzled that the two officers were dressed in identical uniforms. After answering the ET’s questions, the officers asked the ET where he was from. The ET seemed to think the question was funny and began laughing, and then returned into the craft, which promptly took off.

Whitley and Ann Strieber present a case from a woman who, in the summer of 1968, was driving with her daughter outside of Flagstaff, Arizona when they were both taken onboard a craft. Although initially quite frightened, the woman was amazed when the human-looking ETs communicated telepathically, smiling and laughing during the entire time she was onboard. Interestingly, the ETs were teaching her how to pilot the craft.

On Feb 7, 1969, Thiago Machado of Pirassununga, Brazil encountered a landed UFO and occupants. Thiago was smoking a cigarette, and the ETs appeared to find this behavior quite amusing.

In Jul of 1972, a woman was woken by a sound outside her home in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. Looking out the window, she saw a UFO hovering over the building next door. Inside were two male human-looking figures. As she watched, one of them said something to the other, which was apparently funny, as the ET began to laugh.

On Oct 19, 1975, a couple was driving with their dog near Llangothlin in New South Wales, Australia when a UFO began pacing their car. The dog became scared and jumped into the front seat and began acting up. Looking up into the craft, they saw several human-looking figures staring down at them. One of them was pointing at them, apparently laughing at the fact that their pet dog was jumping all over inside the car.

A bizarre case comes from researcher, Salvador Frexiedo. In the summer of 1976, a busload of passengers in Santander, Colombia were shocked when twenty short humanoids emerged from the forest and stopped the bus, then began rocking back and forth, eventually tipping it over on its side. The humanoids began laughing hysterically and then, on cue, ran off back into the forest.

In Aug of 1977, Viktor Alexandreovich was boating on the Dnieper River in Ukraine when he was taken onboard a craft piloted by human-looking ETs. He says that the ETs were very kind, smiled often and had a strong sense of humor.

An amazing case of ET contact occurred in an unknown location to teacher, Mark Andrews. On Sep 3, 1995, he was invited onboard a craft to help ETs become oriented to Earth life. While onboard the craft, he was assigned to a young boy who pointed at him and began laughing with amusement. He told Mark, “I am assigned to be your baby sitter!”

These are just some of the many accounts of ET humor. Cases involving ET humor are more common than many people realize. They show that ETs are more like us than different, and that they share the same emotions we do.

In 1973, seven-year-old John Yost of Pittsburgh, PA had an experience that would alter the course of his life forever. He awoke in the middle of the night and went to the bathroom to get a drink of water. As he stood in front of the sink, something very strange happened.

Looking in the doorway, he saw a strange figure. He could hardly believe his eyes. It was Ultraman, a superhero character from one of his favorite TV shows. What was Ultraman doing in his house? How did he get there? What did he want?

John stared in shock. This was impossible. And yet it was happening. He had no fear, until suddenly, John felt a strange sinking feeling, like the floor was coming out from under him. Dazzling colored lights began swirling around him. Sensing danger, he began to fight.

Without warning, there was a strange shift. John had been standing in the bathroom facing Ultraman, who stood in the hallway above the stairs. Now their positions were reversed. How had this happened. Ultraman reached forward and placed his hand on John’s shoulder. John found himself tumbling head over heels down the wooden staircase.

He screamed in fear, waking up his parents who rushed out of their bedroom to find John at the bottom of the stairs. He tearfully told them what happened. Puzzled and alarmed, they quickly searched the house for any intruders. There was no sign of Ultraman. They were all baffled and had no logical explanation.

The next day, John went outside to play. After returning home, his mom checked to make sure that he was okay and saw a strange mark on his shoulder, precisely where Ultraman had placed his hand. “What’s this?” she asked.

John explained that Ultraman had touched him on that spot. Shortly later, John’s father took him to the doctor. He told John not to tell the doctor anything about this Ultraman nonsense. And when John let it slip out, his father became angry and made it very clear that John was never to talk about Ultraman again.

John was a good boy, and obeyed his parents. From this point on, he buried this memory and never told anyone about it. It became his deep dark secret, something that no one could ever know.

Life continued on as normal. He grew up, and started a career with the Department of the Treasury. One day he realized that this was not what he wanted to do with his life; instead he wanted to work in the television and film industry. He quit his job and pursued his dreams. He was very successful and enjoyed a wonderful career making commercials, TV shows of all kinds, and working with many famous people in show business. He was happy.

Then one day, he was in Borrego Springs, CA working on a new project. Work had ended for the day, and he and his crew were enjoying the evening and watching the beautiful desert skies studded with stars when somebody showed, “Look, what’s that!” A brilliant light hung in the sky. It was a UFO!

John felt a sudden, strange sinking feeling. He recognized the feeling. He was instantly transported to age 7, when he had his face-to-face encounter with Ultraman. Panic swept over him and he fled to his room, where he broke down crying. What was happening to him? Why was this sighting affecting him so profoundly? What did this have to do with Ultraman?

John struggled with anxiety, fear and confusion. Something very significant was happening to him and he needed answers. He began to do research. The only explanation that seemed to fit was that he was a UFO experiencer. He finally sought out hypnosis. His memories came roaring back. Now he knew what happened to him.

Realizing that he was not alone, and that there were likely millions of people out there struggling with these same experiences, John decided to document his journey in the only way he knew how, with film. He began working on a documentary, chronicling his experiences and those of several others. And so the film Alien Abduction Answers was born. Creating the documentary was a labor of love. Different from most documentaries on the subject, John’s film was not told from the viewpoint of an expert on the subject, but from his own perspective as an experiencer. 

In 2022, the film was released to the public. It instantly began earning rave reviews and awards of excellence. John found himself at the forefront of the UFO field. Suddenly he was a sought-after presenter at UFO conventions, film festivals, UFO radio shows and podcasters and more.

This interview presents John Yost’s journey from his childhood encounter with Ultraman, his adult awakening as a UFO experiencer, his search for truth, and the completion of his award-winning documentary. 

To learn more about John’s journey from confusion and fear to hope and curiosity, check out his documentary, Alien Abduction Answer. Now available on multiple platforms.

USOs! Unidentified submersible objects! For many years, there wasn’t much research into the subject of USOs. UFO research focused mostly on flying objects. But today UFO investigators have come to realize that our oceans are swarming with extraterrestrial craft. Mile for mile, one of the top producers of USO reports is the stretch of water off the southern California coast, known as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro channel. There are now more than 150 documented cases on record.

This video presents more than a dozen dramatic cases of UFO/USO activity in the Santa Catalina channel. These are cases involving multiple witnesses, radar confirmation, photographs, films, physiological effects and more.

Jan 28, 1953, Rex Hardy Jr, a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy and others observed four silver discs over Malibu, CA. They estimated that the objects were each the size of a B-36 aircraft, and moved at about 1200 MPH. This was the first of several sightings in that area that would cause great concern for Air Force officers.

Dec 16, 1953, Clarence ‘Kelly’ Johnson, designer of the U2 aircraft was with his wife near Pt. Mugu when saw a strange object moving against the prevailing winds. At the same time, the crew of a Lockheed WV2 aircraft sighted the same object from Long Beach. Project Bluebook officers investigated the case and told the witnesses they had seen nothing but a “lenticular cloud!”

Mar 22, 1957, two UFOs were detected on radar at LAX Airport. When the objects approached to within ten miles, the Air Force scrambled F-89 jets, at which point, the radar station lost power. Minutes later, the objects appeared during a missile test at Pt. Mugu and were filmed. Unfortunately, the film was classified and has never been released. The next day, the objects returned and were seen by hundreds of people and again caught on radar.

2004, an anonymous civilian witness driving along the Pacific Coast Highway near Torrance saw three glowing objects only 400 feet over his car. A few months later, he and his entire family saw a disc-shaped craft while boating near Catalina Island.

Aug 8, 2005, a group of eight shark fishermen were off the coast of Newport Beach when the saw a bright object approaching. It hovered a few miles away only 100 feet above the water. Then it started to come closer, causing some of the fishermen to become concerned. One of the men, however, received a strong impression of positivity from the object.

Dec 2, 2006, a wedding party at Newport Beach were along the beach when an eerie silence descended over them. Looking up, they saw the shadow of an object they estimated to be about 500 feet in diameter.

Jun 1963, the best man at a wedding in Laguna Beach was taking a nighttime walk along the beach when he saw a glowing object with portholes just beneath the waves. He first thought it might be a submarine, but realized that it was far too close to the shore.

1972, Robert Snyder was visiting his friends in Pacific Palisades when they all saw a disc-shaped object covered with colored lights approach from the north. As they watched, the object descended into the water and then began to move underwater faster at extremely high speeds.

Jun 1980, two people were camping at Point Mugu when they saw what they first thought were buoys with lights on them floating just offshore. Then suddenly, the objects rose into air, hovered for a half-minute, and darted away in the blink of an eye.

Mid-1980s, art director, Xander Smith revealed his sighting of brilliant lights offshore of Malibu. He first thought it might be a big-money production of a movie until the next day when he learned that more than a hundred people in the area had seen the “mysterious lights” and nobody could explain them.

1989-1994, Many witnesses along the coast from Marina Del Rey to Rancho Palos Verdes observed many objects floating under the water. In one instance, a very large USO was seen releasing smaller ones. In another incident, witnesses were warned off by mysterious government agents.

1996, Jason Brooks was with his girlfriend at Salt Beach in Dana Point when they observed what they thought was a boat. Then suddenly the “boat” took off straight up and began performing incredible darting maneuvers for 30 minutes. The next day, the USOs were back!

Throughout the 1960s, a resident of Rolling Hills observed numerous UFOs/USOs. Then one evening, an object hovered over her car, causing EM effects, then moved directly over her house. That evening, her father (who worked for the Navy designing ULF antenna) experienced what she believes was direct contact.

How would you like to fly a UFO? It’s not as unique as you might think. In fact, 
contactees all over world are reporting this kind of experience. According to the 
"FREE" study, about thirteen percent of contactees say that they have piloted a UFO. 
Researcher Grant Cameron has written a book (Sky Pilots) profiling dozens of cases!

In January of 1973, fourteen-year-old Dolly Safran had a missing time encounter with 
a UFO over her home in the Florida Everglades. This was not Dolly’s first encounter; 
this had happened many times before. But this time was different. After the encounter, 
Dolly sat down and meditated and was able to fully recall what happened. And what 
Dolly remembered astonished her. She had been taken onboard the craft and was given 
the opportunity to work directly with the ETs. Dolly agreed, and the ETs asked her 
what she would like to learn. Dolly asked if she could learn how to pilot the UFO 
craft. The ETs agreed. So began Dolly’s experiences as a UFO pilot. She began 
having fully conscious encounters where she was taken onboard and trained how to 
fly the UFO. The craft is an alive creature embodied by a fifth-dimensional entity 
that Dolly calls “Tlera.”

Dolly first had to be tested, physically, neurologically and especially psychically. 
After that, she was taught all about the gravitational and magnetic field lines of 
planets and how the aliens harness the energy of a planet to maneuver their craft. 
Dolly then sat with the grays and went through their flight school, watching and 
learning all the procedures and processes involved with piloting UFOs. 

After five years of intensive training, Dolly was finally ready for her first flight. 
She sat down in the pilot seat, joined psychically with the craft (which is itself an 
alive entity) and traveled to another planet beyond our own solar system. Says Dolly, 
“You can actually feel yourself becoming weightless. You’re magnetically charged. Your 
body becomes somewhat weightless. That’s what it feels like. You’re not constrained 
by anything. You become part of the thing that you’re in.”

Flying the craft is done without any instrumentation. They are all driven psychically. 
“Learning to fly is the same no matter what kind of craft you’re in,” Dolly explains. 
“Navigation on a craft is a little bit different, depending on where you are and what 
you’re doing. If you’re in the atmosphere of a planet, you’re going to fly different 
if you’re going to travel over a dimensional shift. So different applications of the 
flying occur at those times. If I’m dimensionally shifting, I’m using hard telepathy, 
all telepathy. I don’t guide the ship manually in any way. It’s all telepathy. I’m 
becoming a partner mentally with the craft, with the engines of the craft and with the 
systems of the craft.”

Dolly learned how to fly the craft interstellar distances to virtually any point in the 
universe. This is done through a process the ETs call opening a “light gate.” This 
allows them to traverse vast distances in a matter of seconds. “A giant flash of light 
opens up,” Dolly says. “One of the reasons we can’t see out is because it’s so brilliant 
it would probably blind all of us, including Tlera. Because he has sight sensors. So, 
we’re protected from it. But there’s a brilliant flash of white light around us. And we 
go through it. We actually jump and go through the light. And when we do, we are no 
longer in this dimension. We’re not in any other dimension. We are in the in-between 
place. We are in a doorway, and it’s instantaneous. It happens within a split second. I 
can feel a shift, and so can Tlera, and so can everyone else onboard that ship. You feel 
it, you know it just happens. It rips right through you. It’s like -- you know when an 
elevator’s coming down, and you’ve got that jump, that weird gee force? That’s what it 
feels like. Because it can disorient you. There’s a lot of electromagnetic energy all 
around you. And it happens that fast.”

Dolly’s experiences with piloting a craft are among the most extensive on record. She 
reports traveling all over the Earth, across the solar system and to many distant parts 
of the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond. She has had fun joy rides, very serious missions, 
close-calls almost resulting in accidents and much more. In this video, Dolly talks about 
her lifelong experiences working and living with the ETs and piloting their craft for 
various missions. Dolly is able to explain exactly how the UFOs fly and what their 
agenda is on this planet.

<p>Did you know that airports are a powerful magnet for UFO activity? There are dozens of 
cases coming from across world, reaching all the way back to the late 1940s and 
continuing up to the present day. These are not just sightings; many involve UFO landings 
and humanoids of all types. These cases represent outstanding evidence of the reality of 
UFOs and the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. Many of these cases are widely 
viewed by professional observers, pilots, meteorologists, air-traffic controllers and 
more. Some involve physical landing traces. Some are confirmed by radar. And quite a 
few involve actual photographs of the craft.</p>

<p>It might seem surprising that UFOs would be attracted to a location that is not only 
crowded with people, but also contains radar arrays designed to detect incoming aircraft. 
On the other hand, these cases also have a certain level of logic to them. Airports are 
designed for aircraft to both land and take off. So, in a way, it’s fittingly 
appropriate that UFOs should be attracted to them. And as these cases show, they are, 
and in large numbers.</p>

<p><span class="seeDate">Mar 10, 1948</span>: Chihuahua Airport in Mexico is visited by a 
hovering disc. A few days later, on Mar 10, four discs appear over Central Airport in 
Mexico City in view of hundreds of witnesses.</p>

when a UFO hovers only a few feet over the runway.</p>

<p>Dec 22, 1962: A UFO lands directly on the runway at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires, 
Argentina and is viewed by tower personnel and pilots.</p>

<p>Jul 15, 1965: Controllers, pilots and employees at Canberra Airport in Australia are 
stunned by the appearance of UFOs hovering 5000 feet overhead.</p>

<p>Jul 28, 1965. Grano de Oro Airport at Maracaibo, Venezuela is visited by three 
luminous discs which are tracked on radar.</p>

approached by a 3-foot-tall figure with huge eyes who asks him, “Won’t you come with 
us? We need one more.”</p>

<p>These are just a few of the many incredible airport-UFO encounters all over the 
world. Among the most dramatic is the 2006 incident at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. So 
many cases! The question is why? Are they putting on displays? Are they checking up 
on our technology? Are they preparing for a worldwide landing? Many questions remain.</p>

Cases of UFO Healings are not new. They have been occurring for more than 100 years. Most major researchers have multiple cases, and they are reported by all kinds of people from all over the world. There are more than 300 documented cases, and they are recognized as a regular feature of UFO contact.

This video presents ten shocking cases of UFO healings. Each case contains surprising and unique elements that offer profound insights into the aliens and their agenda on our planet.

Marla (pseudonym) from Marysville, WA had suffered for years from kidney disease, and developed a large gallstone which necessitated the surgical removal of her gallbladder. In Jan 2015, following a visit by short, large-headed entities in her bedroom, Marla awoke to find a strange surgical scar on her abdomen. It was deep, but pain-free, had no blood, and healed with incredible speed. When she went to doctors, they were shocked to find that her gallstone had been removed, but her gallbladder was still there!

Maria M. Rivera of Aguada, Puerto Rico was suffering from cancer all through her body when (in 2006) she and her family had a UFO sighting followed by many visits by gray ETs. Then Maria was taken onboard a craft and underwent a painful operation. Afterward, she went to the doctor and was shocked to discover that the cancer was now gone.

On Jul 19, 1988, Diane and Phyllis (mother and daughter) drove to their home in Johannesburg, South Africa and were stopped by a human-looking female who guided them onto a craft. From age 13, Diane had suffered from chronic jaundice. The ETs healed her and gave them both warnings about huge environmental catastrophes soon to strike our planet. 

In 1986, Richard T., paralyzed and wheelchair-bound, was enjoying an evening on the beach in La Jolla, CA when a huge torpedo-shaped craft hovered overhead. Richard was taken into the craft, wheelchair and all. Onboard, he saw several short humanoids and then blacked out. Over the next few days, Richard’s paralysis disappeared. He was healed.

On Aug 30, 1979, Jean Cyr (a retired Canada Army officer) and his family were drawn outside of their home in St. Eustache, Quebec by an odd humming sound. They saw a glowing metallic disc rise from the fields near their home. This began a series of encounters which was witnessed by many of their neighbors and local airport officials. Jean began waking up with unexplained marks on his body. After several encounters, Jean, who had severe multiple sclerosis, was healed.

In the mid-1930s, a 13-year-old boy suffering from tuberculosis found himself on his deathbed. Then he had a “dream” that he was taken into a weird craft and healed by strange-looking figures. With no idea of aliens or UFOs, he couldn’t explain what happened. He only knew that he had somehow been healed. It wasn’t until the 1950s, that he heard about UFOs and aliens that he understood his experience.

In Mar 1977, Carmina of San Juan, Puerto Rico was confronted by a strange human-looking gentleman who had somehow managed to get past the guards in her secured office building. The man informed her that he was an ET, and that Carmina’s daughter should continue her UFO research with investigator, Jorge Martin, and that Martin himself was being spied on by US intelligence officers. Carmina, who had been diagnosed with a cyst in her breast, received the shocking news that her cyst had miraculously disappeared.

Richard Rylka, a well-known New Jersey UFO contactee, had developed a large tumor on his forehead. While in Atlantic City, he was visited by human-looking ETs who took him onboard a healed his tumor. Rylka, whose tumor had been seen by all his friends and family, was cured. 

In 1979, Faina Maksimovna was facing surgery to remove a tumor on her thyroid. Frightened of surgery, Faina prayed to God. To her shock, that evening she was visited by three human-looking figures who proceeded to enact a healing on her. When Faina later went to see her doctors, they were baffled and amazed to see that her tumor was gone.

In Dec 1989, Mae, a 60-year-old waitress from Mississippi was being forced to retired due to severe arthritis. Driving home, a UFO dropped down over her car and pulled her onboard. Mae found herself surrounded by several figures who placed a “kind of rod” over her body. The next morning, her pain was gone. She was healed.

These ten cases show that people from all walks of life are being healed by many different types of ETs. They show that healing is one of the primary ET agendas, and that ETs have the ability to heal almost any kind of illness, condition or disease.

UFO sightings are not as random as they might seem. Researchers discovered long ago that UFOs find certain locations very interesting. These are called “UFO attractors,” and there are a lot them. Some include military bases, nuclear power stations, prisons, graveyards, rocket launches, mines, schoolyards, drive-in movie theaters and more. Another well-known UFO attractor is dams and hydroelectric stations. However, there has not been much research into these types of cases. Until now!

This video presents more than 30 cases of UFOs hovering over dams. And not only hovering, but landing too. Several cases also involve humanoids. The evidence for these cases is astounding. There are multiple witnesses, physiological effects, electromagnetic effects, landing traces, photos and more. In some cases, the UFOs appear to be siphoning water from the reservoirs, or electricity from the power stations. Some of the dams are visited over and over again.

These cases reach back from the modern age of UFOs in 1947 to the present day, and are occurring all over the world: Australia, Canada, Europe, Canada, the United States, South America and more. Why are UFOs visiting our dams? Are they examining our technology? Do they want the water and electricity? Or are there other reasons? The answers are here!

Jul 10, 1947. Three glowing V-shaped objects circle over the Owyhee Dam in Parma, ID for more than 10 minutes.

Feb 10, 1953. Army security guard Jessie E. Kent observes two glowing discs hovering 150 feet above the dam and reservoir at the Richard Quartermaster Depot in Richmond, VA.

May 1953. Two men driving over the bridge of Loch Raven Dam in Baltimore, MD are confronted by a UFO which stalls their vehicle. Five years later, on Oct 26, 1958, two men driving over the same bridge have the same experience. Over the next decades, many other encounters occur.

1950s. An employee of Davis Dam in AZ reports that UFOs would repeatedly hover over the dam, apparently drawing electric power from the hydroelectric station.

Jul 1962. Two men fishing at the Foote Dam reservoir in Oscoda, MI see a huge saucer-shaped craft covered with multi-colored lights right overhead. Moments later, fighter jets from nearby Wurtsmith AFB chase it away.

Oct 24, 1962. Railroad employee Lester Sandler reports seeing a UFO over the Horsetooth Reservoir and Dixon Dam area. Moments later another witness reports a UFO landing at the base of the dam.

Jun 20, 1964. Two witnesses see a UFO and humanoids hovering over the Gorge Dam in Newhalem, WA. U.S. fighter jets chase the object away and a govt investigation follows.

1964. AF Officer Frank Kinsey and his brother see a “USO” rise out of Lake Casitas. Through a porthole, they see a humanoid looking back at them. Kinsey quickly snaps of a photo.

Jan 11, 1966. Hundreds of people observe a UFO maneuver for several hours at low elevation over Wanaque Reservoir and Raymond Dam. Ten months later on Oct 10, the UFO returns and is witnessed by hundreds and even photographed.

Aug 30, 1970, security guard Almiro Martins de Freitas shoots at a UFO as it hovers directly over the Funil Dam. Almiro is struck by a beam of light which temporarily blinds him. The UFO leaves, but returns multiple times over the next week.

Jun 1971, a family has three encounters in a week by the Clearwater Dam in Piedmont, MO, including one “USO” in the reservoir itself. One year later, more sightings occur, generating national headlines.

1971. A man camping in Jamison Valley by the Warragamba Dam in New South Wales, Australia walks upon a landed UFO and several humanoids.

Feb 1973. Numerous witnesses (including police) observe a UFO dive into the waters of Wheeler Dam in Huntsville, AL.

Jun 5, 1973. Two fishermen at Rio Dam in Port Jervis, NY see a glowing UFO sucking water up from the lake. Looking through a porthole, they see a strange, brown-skinned humanoid.

These are just a few of the many other cases occurring all over the world: Dillon Dam in CO, Castelo de Bode Dam in Portugal, Fort Phantom Lake Dam in TX, Blewett Falls Dam in NC, Palmar Dam in Uruguay, Muskrat Dam in Canada, Alfalfal Dam in Chile, Wivenhoe Dam in Australia, El Tunal Dam in Argentina, Scammonden Dam in England, and so many others.

There are too many cases to deny. UFOs are showing a strong interest in our dams and hydroelectric stations. They are clearly keeping tabs on our technology, and in some cases, appear to be taking water and electricity. These cases show that UFOs are not imaginary, but are highly technological craft piloted by extraterrestrials.

What’s the most common day to see a UFO? The answer may surprise you: the 4th of July! That’s right, Independence Day produces more UFO reports than any other day. The question is, why? Are people mistaking fireworks for genuine UFOs? Or is something else going on here?

An examination of the UFO reports made on the fourth of July shows some interesting patterns. Many do involve fiery glowing orbs, or what may very well be sky lanterns, also known as party lanterns. These are small paper balloons set aloft with a small candle. They can rise up to 4000 feet and from a distance, look very much like a UFO.

But the fact is, there are literally hundreds of cases where this explanation simply does not fit! Some do look like orbs, however, sky lanterns fizzle out after fifteen minutes, and many of these orb sightings last much longer. Also, orbs cannot turn at right angles, stop still in the sky, or accelerate at high speeds, as many of these orbs do. Furthermore, many of the Independence Day UFO encounters involve structured craft, metallic saucers complete with portholes and multicolored lights. Some cases also involve actual humanoids. Clearly the fireworks explanation doesn’t fit. 

There are so many cases involving UFOs seen on the Fourth of July that it is clear something very profound is happening here. Fireworks appear to be a UFO magnet. Many of the witnesses have come to the conclusion that UFOs are coming down to watch the fireworks show. ETs love fireworks!

But it might be more than this. Remember, on the Fourth of July, millions of people all across the United States flock outside at night and stare upwards. Could it be that the extraterrestrials are aware of this and are using this day as an opportunity to announce their presence. The answer appears to be a big YES! Because many of these reports involve UFOs that not only watch the fireworks show, but they put on a show themselves. They will flash their lights, dart around, and put on a fantastic display for the stunned audience.

This video presents dozens of cases in which UFOs have appeared during fireworks shows all across the United States. Here is what some of the witnesses are saying:

“We were watching fireworks, which were to our east. I noticed the UFO to the north, but said nothing to no one. I observed it for two minutes as it moved silently eastward, then suddenly reversed direction as it picked up speed. Then assuming its original course once again, it moved slowly upwards and out of sight.” –1963, Greensboro, NC.

“There was a tremendous flash of lightning at the same time a firework went off in the sky. I looked up and saw an absolutely huge saucer-shaped object sitting right over the ‘mountain’ we were next to.” –1965, Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY.

“When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft. It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street, where we were all gathered.” –1977, Federal Way, WA.

“[It was] a disc-shaped object displaying multicolored lights in a circle, hovering at what seemed to be 100 feet above us and the gathering crowd.” –1978, Nashua, NH.

“It made no sound. I was scared to death…I wanted to hide under the car…I wanted to scream, but couldn’t. I realized I was not supposed to remember this happening. I kept telling myself, I will remember. The craft’s size was huge, bigger than the fairgrounds bleacher area.” –1980, St. Paul, MN.

“My brother was watching the fireworks when all of a sudden he went as white as a ghost. My mother shouted out, ‘Oh, my God!’ I went to see what was going on…it was the weirdest thing ever, a disc-shaped with small portholes going around its midsection.” –1982, Hermosa Beach, CA.

“Most people don’t get to see a craft that close and distinct. I even saw the molding around the windows…Three Nordic-looking men in white, with blond hair, staring at us as if we were mere cattle. I could see them from the belly up, not sure if they were standing or sitting. They had no apparatus on at all. I never took my eyes off it until it was gone from sight.” –1999, Lancaster, PA.

There are too many cases to deny. The aliens are coming down to watch the fireworks shows, and they are also putting on displays themselves. And in fact, these are more than just simple sightings. Every single one of these cases are actually Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind! Fireworks are evidently an effective method to call down UFOs out of the sky.

As a general rule, when someone is visited by gray ETs, they find themselves paralyzed, unable to their body. “Don’t worry, we won’t hurt you,” the grays say. “Come with us.” It is perhaps the most common phrase the ETs say. In cases where people have no fear, they are often given freedom of movement. Others do have fear and have a fight or flight response. In some cases, witnesses break free from their paralysis and react by attacking the extraterrestrials and punching them in the face, choking them around the neck, or getting into some sort of physical altercation. It happens more often than you might think. This video presents more than a dozen cases in which people actually assaulted gray aliens by pushing, kicking, choking or punching.

NOV 3, 1975: Woodcutter Travis Walton and six others encounter a UFO at treetop level in the Sitgreaves National Forest, AZ. Travis runs under the UFO and is taken onboard. Confronted by grays, he physically fights with them.

APR 5, 2017: A young man from Del Valle, TX is woken up by his dogs barking. Searching the house, he sees two grays in his mother’s bedroom. He jumps forward and punches one of the grays in the head. When the second one grabs him, the witness punches him too. And then a third gray comes in.

WINTER 1985: Patsy Wingate of Knoxville, TN wakes up to see three grays approaching her. Reacting in self-defense, she jumps up and chokes the middle gray, snapping its neck. Astonished, the other two grays scoop up the gray and flee!

1985: Tim, a sports-instructor from New Iberia, LA wakes up to find himself lying on a table onboard a UFO. He breaks free from his paralysis and begins to explore. Grays rush in and Tim begins punching the grays, one after another. Suddenly a crowd of them surround him and Tim realizes he is out-numbered.

2016: “Gary” from Cumbria, England wakes up one morning and encounters a gray in his living room. Angry at the repeated intrusions into his home, he grabs the gray around the neck. The gray starts screaming telepathically, “Let go, let go!” A few days later, the grays come again, and Gary is ready. This time he punches one in the face.

1982: Former Marine officer, “Ramon,” is taken onboard a UFO in San Fernando, CA. He becomes angry when the grays try to collect genetic material from him. Summoning his combat training, he breaks free of the paralysis, jumps up and pushes one of the grays down to the floor.

Aug 13, 1975: Sgt Charles Moody of Alamogordo, NM is not happy when a UFO lands in front of his car, grays come out and try to pull him from his car. He opens his car door, knocking one of the grays down. Then he bunches up his fist, and pounds one of the grays in the face.

Oct 27, 1975: David Stephens and his friend are driving near Oxford, ME when a UFO takes control of their car. Next, grays appear and pull David onboard. When they try to undress David for an exam, he resists. He jumps off the table and hits one of the grays.

Oct 2010: Kevin is woken in his home in Bangor, ME and pulled into a craft by gray aliens. When they insert a rod inside his nose, Kevin becomes hostile. He swings out his leg and kicks one of the grays, slamming it hard into the wall, where it collapses in a heap.

UNDATED: An anonymous teenager in high school (location not given) has a very unusual dream where grays enter his room and begin to do a weird procedure on his back. Having scoliosis, he thinks they might be healing him. However, scared and angry that the ETs were not communicating with him, he quickly throws a left hook as hard as he can at the gray’s cheek. The gray lets out a high-pitched scream.

There are more cases like these. John Mack has a case in which a man, angry at being examined, jumps up and chokes a gray. Contactee Dolly Safran (from Georgia) recalls several instances where she was onboard and people reacted violently by punching the grays, pushing them down, or even breaking their arms. These cases show that, when confronted with the unknown, humans often become very fearful and react with violence. Even more importantly, they show that people can overpower the grays, who appear to be physically more fragile than humans. These cases have a lot to teach us both about humans and the grays, and our relationships to each other.

While many people speculate about the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon, cases of landings and humanoids make it clear what they are. UFOs are craft, and they are piloted by extraterrestrials. These kinds of encounters represent the core of the UFO phenomenon. They teach us the most about these visitors to our world, who they are, where they come from and their agenda on our planet. Humanoid encounters have been occurring for a very long time, and are far more common than many people realize. In fact, according to the Roper Polling Organization, as many as one in fifty people may have had these experiences. They occur all across the planet to all kinds of people. The state of California leads the U.S. in the sheer number of encounters. And the cases of humanoids show a corresponding and profound variety of humanoid types. Here are twelve cases of landings and humanoids from the Golden State.

Oct 18, 1927: While driving outside the town of Bakersfield, schoolteacher Richard Sweed comes upon a landed UFO. As he approaches, it makes a loud whining noise, accelerates upward and disappears into the distance, leaving behind a circle of glassified sand.

Dec 1957: Edmond Rucker of El Cajon hears a loud roaring noise outside his home. Venturing outside, he is confronted by a landed UFO and four strange humanoids who speak to him about their mission on Earth.

Apr 14, 1964: A truckdriver on a highway outside of Chico comes upon a domed disc which hovers above his truck causing it to stall. When the UFO lands nearby, the man exits his truck and approaches the craft. He touches the craft and is amazed to hear strange voices coming from inside.

Apr 1964: Gloria Biggs, her husband and mother are driving outside the desert town of Baker when they see a domed-shaped object landed next to the highway ahead of them. As they approach, the UFO takes off. They examine the landing site and discover a weird depression in the ground.

Mar 31, 1966: Two women driving by a construction site near San Francisco see a metallic disc hover at low altitude. Through the windows of the craft, they are amazed to see the silhouettes of several “people” gesticulating at them.

Oct 4, 1973: While driving along the 118 Freeway in Simi Valley, Gary Chopic observes a small triangular-shaped craft with a transparent dome on top. Inside he sees a human-looking figure at the controls. And then the humanoid sees him!

Dec 17, 1973: Driving at night outside of Paso Robles, Sergeant Lance Mathias and his friend Mike Andrews see a hovering spherical UFO sending down a beam of light. Going to investigate they are confronted by two metallic-suited humanoids.

1974: The Overfelt family of Ramona are drawn out of their farmhouse by a huge glowing sphere which lands on a hill near their home. All the animals on the farm react to the presence of the UFO. The Overfelts call the police, who refer them to investigators, who have some important advice.

Mar 6, 1977: While watching over a factory in Sylmar, security guard Douglas Kriese is amazed to see a UFO drop out of the sky and land in a field nearby. He approaches it and hears it making a buzzing sound, and feels it emitting an intense heat. He immediately calls the police.

1977: Two Native American brothers from Colusa contact investigators after a UFO keeps landing near their ranch-home and a long-haired big-nosed humanoid keeps entering their can through the walls. When investigators arrive, they see the UFO themselves!

Oct 31, 1976: a husband a wife motorcycling through downtown Los Angeles see a spherical UFO hovering below the level of the buildings. The sunlight strikes the craft, making it transparent. They then see human-looking figures staring down at them. The wife quickly flashes them the peace sign.

Nov 29, 1988: Maria X. of Sherman Oaks is in her bedroom with her young son when grays show up and render her unable to move. Maria is concerned about her son, but falls unconscious. The next morning, her son exclaims that “My aliens came back!” and provides a vivid description of what it’s like to be pulled by the ETs through the wall.

These twelve cases are just the tip of the iceberg of UFO landings and humanoids in California. And yet, these cases here represent an accurate cross-section of UFO activity across the world. They also show that humanoid encounters often present good hard evidence in the form of landing traces, electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects, and other stunning confirmation.

Face-to-face encounters with humanoids and onboard UFO experiences are the cutting edge of UFO research. Cases like these teach us the most about extraterrestrials, who they are, where they’re from, and their agenda on our planet. Humanoids come in all shapes and sizes, and encounters with them are surprisingly varied. People all over the world have been having encounters with humanoids for a very long time. Each location on the planet has a long history of humanoid encounters. One area with a surprisingly rich history is the state of Arizona. What follows are ten cases from the Grand Canyon state, each with its own insights into the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon.

AN ALIEN ON THE ROAD: On June 9, 1960, a woman was driving with her husband and two children east of Globe. Everyone but her was asleep when she saw what appeared to be a young child about to cross the road. Then it turned its head and what she saw shocked her: the figure was not human!

GROUP OF MUSICIANS ABDUCTED: It was 1968 when a group of musicians finished a gig in Phoenix, and drove out of town to party. Without warning, a UFO appeared and hovered overhead. The next thing they knew, they were being examined by gray aliens.

ABDUCTION IN THE WHITE TANK MOUNTAINS: On June 20, 1980, three women traveled to the White Tank Mountains to investigate recent UFO sightings. Suddenly strange lights approached and all three women fell unconscious, then woke up hours later. Under hypnosis, one of them recalled being taken onboard, where she was given profound messages from the ETs.

UFO ENCOUNTER IN JAKES CORNER: In August of 1987, five people were outside their home in Jakes Corner when they saw a UFO rise up from a mountain and hover overhead. Then it moved over their home and stayed there. At this point, all but two of them went inside, and a bizarre encounter ensued during which the ETs showed a strange interest in the men’s feet.

THE RUBY ALIEN: In August of 1988 Sam visited an abandoned ghost town in Ruby, near the southern border of Mexico, he heard a strange whooshing sound overhead. Nothing strange was visible, but shortly later, he was amazed to see a short humanoid wearing a weird jumpsuit standing nearby. Sam just happened to have a camera, and he quickly snapped a stunning photograph.

A RIDE ABOARD A FLYING SAUCER: In the late 1980s, a retired pilot was driving through the desert near Cave Creek when his car stalled. As he checked the engine, a handsome blond man walked out of the wilderness, announced that he was an extraterrestrial, and offered the man a ride aboard his flying saucer.

CONTACT IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA: At 2:00 a.m., on February 20, 1991, Sheri was woken up by a huge UFO hovering outside her home. She then found herself being taken onboard where she met several different types of ETs, who gave her strange silver medicinal pills, and also a mineral sample. Sheri saved both and handed them over to researchers. Then there were the photos!

ONBOARD ENCOUNTER IN DEWEY: On September 28, 1991, Leslie woke up in her home to find her bed surrounded by grays. More stranger-looking ETs appeared, and Leslie was pulled through the wall of her  home into a craft. During the encounter she was taken to the other side of the world and deep into the ocean. It was an experience which would leave her utterly transformed.

TOUCHED BY A GRAY: In February 1997, Louise and her husband moved into their new home in Chandler. One month later, three grays appeared in her bedroom. One of them stepped forward and touch Louise on the forehead. She blacked out only to discover remarkable evidence of her close encounter.

SOMETHING NOT FROM THIS WORLD. In February 2005, after a long day working at the local ski resort, Eric woke up in his home in Flagstaff to see a gray alien standing over his bed. Freaked out, he flipped his middle finger at the ET and blacked out. Only a few weeks later, he received startling confirmation that he wasn’t the only one in his family having encounters.

These ten accounts provide an accurate representation of humanoid encounters. They show how truly bizarre and varied contact with extraterrestrials can be. They show that encounters can occur anytime and anyplace, and can have a profound effect on a person’s life.

Imagine driving along a remote highway and you see someone stick out their thumb, asking for a ride. You don’t pick up random hitchhikers, but for some reason, you feel compelled to stop. The hitchhiker, you now realize, looks weird, is dressed strangely, and starts to behave in unusual ways. Suddenly you realize that the hitchhiker is not human. This may sound crazy, but the fact is, there are more than a dozen cases on record that fit this exact pattern. Extraterrestrial hitchhikers! It happens more often than you think.

1956: Army officer Virgil Atkinson is driving along the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica, CA when he picks up two young sailors. After dropping them off, he finds himself being followed by a UFO.
 
Oct 10, 1967: Norman C is driving to his home in Lakewood, CO when he is stopped by an odd tall man alongside the highway. The man begins asking him very odd. As the man walks off, a gigantic UFO appears overhead.

Mar 1973: Frank Bales is driving through WA when he stops to pick up two tall strangers wearing white robes. Frank is amazed to see that they have six fingers on each hand! The hitchhikers give him predictions and tell him they are “the Watchers.”

1973: Musician Steve Boucher is driving with his fellow musicians along a highway in Ontario, Canada when they pick-up a hitchhiker. The next thing they realize, a UFO lands on the road in front of them, and the hitchhiker is leading them onboard the UFO.

Oct 18, 1974: Edmoana Toews and Nuria Hanson are driving through a remote area of British Columbia, Canada when they are followed by a UFO. At some point, they feel compelled to give a strange hitchhiker a ride. So begins an ordeal that leaves them convinced that the man was an ET.

1978: Gina and Lois traveling to Phoenix, AZ see a strikingly handsome blond-haired, blue-eyed man thumbing a ride. They never pick up hitchhikers, but can’t stop themselves. The man tells them to have no fear when their car is levitated off the road and into a UFO.

2004: An anonymous pilot driving through the remote desert outside of Yuma, AZ stops to give a man a ride. As they converse, the hitchhiker reveals that he is an extraterrestrial in disguise, working on Earth to help humanity.

Jul 25, 2001: Irina and her father drive near Mishor, Ukraine and see a very handsome man on the side of the road asking for a ride. They give the man a ride. The next thing they know, they are paralyzed, lose control of their car, and discover that the hitchhiker is actually an alien.

Jun 12, 2003. Mr. Zilmerman is on his way to work in Limeira, Brazil when he feels compelled to stop and pick up a hitchhiker. The man in his car is not normal. He is very short, has cat-like eyes, a bald head, a pale oily complexion, smells awful and wears a one-piece tight jumpsuit with bizarre thick-soled shoes. He’s definitely not human!

2004: Mr. O.B., drives near Salisbury, VA and picks up a hitchhiker. O.B., is shocked to see that the man has huge eyes, pale skin, thin blond hair and unusual features. He warns O.B. about the dangers of our political system. From there, things get weirder.

Undated: Dakota is driving between Window Rock and Chinle, AZ and stops to give a man a ride. He now sees that the man is very odd-looking, with thin limbs, very pale skin, and is wearing a shimmering white jumpsuit. Next, they come upon a flying saucer blocking the road.

Undated: Four men leave a wedding reception near their home in Guatemala City when they agree to give a man wearing a cowboy hat a ride. Shortly later, they find themselves confronted by a UFO. The hitchhiker disappears and reappears, and leads all of them onto the UFO.

Aug 1, 2018: An anonymous trucker driving through Corsicana, TX sees a tall, thin, green-skinned figure standing alongside the highway as if looking for a ride. Shocked by the man’s strange appearance, he doesn’t stop. But luckily, he does have an operating dash-cam, which captures the entire incident on video!

With more than a dozen cases, it is clear that this is a thing. Aliens are hitching rides from unwary drivers all over the world. In case after case, the people who have this experience find themselves taking a route they don’t normally take. When the hitchhiker appears, they feel compelled to stop and pick them up. Only then do they notice that the hitchhiker is strange in appearance, dress and behavior. In many of these cases, the drivers end up being taken onboard a UFO! It is one of the most bizarre types of UFO encounters on record, and yet, the chances are, the cases presented here are likely just the tip of the iceberg.

INTERVIEW WITH A FULLY CONSCIOUS UFO CONTACTEE

It goes by many names. Some call the experience UFO abduction. Others call it a Close Encounter of the Third Kind. Some prefer to call it Contact, or an Onboard UFO Experience. Whatever term you prefer, the truth is that many people are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft. In fact, some researchers believe that millions of people have had this experience.
Dolly Safran has been a fully conscious UFO contactee her whole life. Beginning at age fourteen, she has been taken onboard hundreds (if not thousands) of times. She has spent days, weeks, and sometimes months with the ETs, learning from them, working with them, flying the craft, interacting with various ET types, traveling to other star systems and more.

In this interview (Part Five of a series) Dolly describes the very controversial aspect of UFO encounters that many people call abductions. She doesn’t call them that. And neither do the ETs. The extraterrestrials are contacting people and bringing them onboard, but they call this process, “Gathering the Children.”

What is the reason for people being taken onboard? Why are the ETs contacting so many people? Is it for our benefit or theirs? Dolly answers these questions and more, and not from speculation, but from firsthand experience of her many interactions with them.

The reasons, says Dolly, are many. The ETs are here to heal, to teach, to guide, to warn…to help enlighten people to their own psychic abilities. There is a lot of fear and disinformation surrounding the UFO contact experience. Many people experience terror and trauma and believe they are being taken against their will. But after living and working with the ETs for many years, Dolly knows that this is not what is actually happening. The ETs are not here to scare people or harm them. They are here to help. Dolly has been onboard the ET craft hundreds of times when people are picked up for medical exams, consultations, guidance, healings and more. She has not only experienced this herself, she has watched it happen to countless other people. She has been onboard and counseled others during their own close encounters.
 
While some may perceive the experience as scary and negative, the truth is far different. Dolly shares her own experiences with people being taken onboard and healed, taught, guided, awakened to their own contacts. Dolly’s story of UFO contact is one of the most extensive on record. Her case is well-documented with multiple supporting corroborative witnesses, medical records that show her own healings (and implants,) impressive photographic and video evidence and much more. After watching this video, you will see that contact, despite all the fear and misinformation, is in fact a positive experience, one that is for the betterment of all humanity.

For those who want to know more, Dolly’s lifelong experiences (recalled fully consciously and without the use of hypnosis) are presented in the book, “Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure.” A Number One Amazon UFO bestseller. Now available!

Among the closest of UFO encounters are cases involving strange humanoids. It’s one thing to see an unidentified flying object from a distance, it’s quite another to see a gray alien, have missing time or even be taken onboard a craft. It’s these types of encounters where we learn the truth about UFO contact and what it’s like to meet an extraterrestrial face-to-face. This video presents five true accounts of humanoids and high strangeness from the state of Nevada. Of course, humanoids are seen all over the world. And Nevada is no exception. In fact, Nevada has many accounts of this kind. What follows are five of the weirdest and most bizarre.

SHARLEEN’S ONBOARD ENCOUNTER. One evening in Jul of 1964, Sharleen Nicholson was six-months pregnant when her house in Las Vegas began to vibrate with a buzzing noise. A light flooded through the windows. Venturing outside, she saw a saucer landed in the field by her home. Sharleen became filled with a strange calmness. The next thing she knew, she was back inside her home. By morning, she had forgotten the entire experience. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy. A few months later, during a baby shower, someone mentioned the word “UFO,” and the memory of her encounter returned. Had she been taken onboard? She wasn’t sure. 

BOY SHOOTS A GRAY ALIEN. Early one morning in 1970, a father took his 7-year-old son rabbit hunting in the desert east of Reno. He stayed in the car drinking beer while his son took his rifle and searched out his quarry. After shooting a rabbit, he set his sights on another. That’s when he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Looking in that direction, he was shocked to see a short gray-skinned figure with large dark eyes. When it raised its hand toward him, the witness swung his rifle around and shot. The strange creature dropped to the desert floor. Filled with fear and remorse, the boy dropped the rifle and ran back to his father who disbelieved him and told him to go back and get the gun. Upon returning to the site, the strange humanoid figure was gone. But up in the sky was a large cigar-shaped craft. The next thing the boy knew, he was taken onboard. 

MISSING TIME IN INDIAN SPRINGS. On the evening of Dec 3, 1983, a small group of airmen from Creech AFB in Indian Springs hiked a few miles off-base to have a little beer-keg party. Growing tired, one of them decided to walk back to the base dorms. But his journey back was interrupted. Growing cold, he hunched down to warm up. The next thing he knew, he was waking up to find a man hold a gun to his head. He was sleeping on a couch in the home of a complete stranger. He and the homeowner were mystified as the house was protected by a tall fence and a guard-dog, and all the doors and the windows had been locked from the inside. Even stranger, there was a large incision on his abdomen. 

THE ABDUCTION OF ALEX PODOVICH. On Nov 7, 2002, Las Vegas resident, Alex Podovich woke up to find a strange glowing light descending upon him. His body became paralyzed and he felt himself moving through the air. The next thing he knew, he was lying naked on a strange bed in a weird room, surrounded by humanoid figures with weird eyes. A bizarre ring-like device was fitted over his head. So began a series of encounters with apparent extraterrestrials. At first Alex had no fear. But he soon came to believe that the ETs were taking his reproductive material to produce hybrid children. Later experiences with the ETs would seem to confirm this. Alex then decided that these encounters were not in his best interests and he began to resist them. 

HUMANOIDS ON ROUTE 95. On the evening of Dec 8, 2006, a married couple decided take a road trip from Las Vegas to the remote desert town of Beatty, NV. Their journey took them along Route 95 which led them through the town of Indian Springs and deep into the Nevada desert. At some point during their trip, they noticed a light hovering ahead of them on the highway. Slowing down, they saw that the light was actually a scraft hovering only a few hundred feet high. Even more shocking, through the windows they could see several strange humanoid figures both sitting down and standing, all of them looking down at them from above. It was instantly clear to both of them that the figures were not human.

As can be seen, Nevada has no shortage of humanoids and high strangeness. About 87 percent of the state is owned by the Federal Government. It is also the location of the infamous Area 51, believed by many to be an area involving the reverse-engineering of UFO craft. Whatever the case, it’s clear that something very profound is happening in the Silver State.

Sightings of UFOs are undeniably interesting, but far more compelling are cases involving humanoids. Face-to-face encounters with extraterrestrial entities provide a profound insight into the UFO phenomenon and the alien presence on our planet. ETs are being seen all over the world, in every state, in every country. This video presents six extraordinary and unusual cases of humanoid entities from the state of New York. Each of these cases are strange and unique, and each offers an opportunity to further our understanding of extraterrestrials.

CASE ONE: IMPLANTED BY ALIENS. In 1955, eight-year-old Richard Price was playing near his home in Lansingburgh, NY when he encountered short humanoid ETs and a landed UFO. He was taken onboard the craft, physically examined and given an alien implant. Further procedures followed. Richard was then returned, but his life would never be the same. His case became on of the first involving the scientific study of an alien implant.

CASE TWO: A UFO LANDS ON MAIN STREET. On July 31, 1967, security guard Sidney Zipkin came upon a UFO landed in a parking lot along Main Street in Churchville, NY. To Sidney’s shock, two short humanoids raced into the craft which took off straight up. Sidney told his superiors who could see that Sidney was badly shaken. Unknown to any of them, numerous other people, including several police officers, saw UFOs in the same area at the same time.

CASE THREE: THE NEWFIELD UFO FLAP. On the evening of October 24, 1967, two young boys, Donald Chiszar and Pat Crozer were outside their home in Newfield, NY and looking up, saw a large structured craft with portholes hovering about 130 feet overhead. Looking through the portholes, the saw two strange-looking humanoids staring down at them. The craft took off, but the next night it returned. So began a massive UFO flap involving hundreds of witnesses.

CASE FOUR: “THEY WERE NOT HUMAN.” On the evening of June 10, 1972, an anonymous nurse, her mother and infant son, drove home along Coleman Station Road in Millerton, NY. Without warning, a massive craft dropped from the sky and hovered overhead only 150 feet away. Looking through the portholes, they saw five gray-skinned humanoids looking right back at them. They raced away and to their shock, the UFO began to follow them home.

CASE FIVE: “I AM NOT AFRAID OF THEM.” On February 26, 1983, Monique O’Driscoll drove with her daughter through upstate New York. Suddenly a massive boomerang-shaped craft appeared low overhead. Monique mentally called out, “Don’t Go!” To her amazement, the craft approached even closer. Two months later, Monique was visited again, only this time she had missing time. Going under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard the craft.

CASE SIX: THE GROUP ABDUCTIONS. In September 1989, a group of five friends (James, Curtis, Petra, Brian and Paul) decided to spend the Labor Day weekend at a trailer in a forested area of Saugerties, NY. That evening, the trailer filled with light and they experienced a period of missing time. Over the next four years, each time they spent time at the trailer, weird things happened. Under hypnosis, they learned that they were all being taken together onboard a UFO.

These six cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but together they show what it’s like to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. Each have multiple witnesses and additional corroborating evidence. And each makes one fact very clear: we are not alone!

A UFO encounter can have many profound effects upon a witness. A person can be physically affected, with such symptoms as injuries or healings. An encounter affects a person mentally, challenging their world view. A UFO encounter is also a very emotional experience and can trigger the full range of emotions. But it goes beyond that. A close encounter can also transform a person spiritually, triggering a wide variety of paranormal events. It’s not unusual for contactees to experience OBEs, precognition, past-life memories, channeling, ghostly encounters and more.

One of the most bizarre effects, one that has received little attention, is that following an encounter, some abductees experience spontaneous human levitation. As unusual as this may sound, there are a growing number of cases. This video presents more than a dozen cases of people who have levitated as a result of a UFO encounter. It appears that ETs are teaching people how to levitate.

One case comes from French researchers Aime Michel and Jacques Vallee. It involves an anonymous medical doctor who had a close encounter that healed him of a wound on his ankle and partial paralysis. Following the encounter, the doctor also experienced two episodes of spontaneous human levitation.

Whitley Strieber (author of Communion and other books) also reports having a spontaneous levitation experience in his cabin in upstate New York. Strieber had just gone to bed one evening in 1986 when he found himself floating up to the ceiling. He rose up and down several times before finally coming down to a landing in his bed. Following this experience, he began to research these experiences and located two other contactees who reported nearly identical events.

Another well-known contactee who has experienced spontaneous levitation is Dr. Steven Greer MD, founder of CSETI. Following an onboard UFO experience at age nineteen in his hometown of Boone, NC, Greer found himself able to make leaping bounds, floating more than twenty feet with each step. Some years later, he experienced another even more profound episode of spontaneous levitation and floated a few feet above the ground for several yards before coming in for a landing.

These cases are not as rare as you might think. Researcher Budd Hopkins (author of Missing Time and Intruders) uncovered two cases, both involving children who were having UFO experiences. In each case, the children levitated on several occasions. In both cases, the witnesses connected their levitations to their UFO encounters.

A firsthand case comes from a man by the name of Maurice who reports that in 1966, he and his sister were taken onboard a craft. In the hours following the experience, both found that they had the ability to levitate. They floated around the basement for an hour and afterwards played with this ability in their yard. 

In 1951, eight-year-old Mary Frank (who would later discover she was a contactee) experienced a profound levitation event during which she flew down a corridor for several yards, even turning corners, before coming to a soft landing on her feet. She tried several times to duplicate it but was never able to repeat the experience.

In 1953, five-year-old Ramon (who would later become an officer in the Marines) was taken onboard a UFO from his home in California. Following the encounter, he discovered that he was able to levitate. In the days and weeks following his onboard encounter, he levitated on at least three separate occasions, two episodes which were verified by outside witnesses.

In another case, a mother went to check on her infant child and discovered that her baby was floating above her crib. Later, her child would report many UFO experiences, including being taken onboard a UFO.

Researcher Rey Hernandez reports on the case of Alberto Fernandez, a contactee from Florida. On one occasion, Fernandez’s wife woke to find her husband floating above his bed, sound asleep.

Another amazing case comes from fully conscious contactee, Dolly Safran. Throughout her life, Dolly has had numerous onboard UFO encounters. She also reports many cases of spontaneous levitations. While most of these occurred as a young child, even as an adult she experienced levitation, and on several occasions, the related phenomenon of telekinesis.

Many other cases exist. The dozen cases presented here are likely only the tip of the iceberg. One thing is clear, there is a connection between human levitation and the UFO contact experience. ETs are teaching people a wide variety of psychic abilities, including the ability to levitate.

Bigfoot is real! While mainstream science has refused to accept the existence of the hair hominin, reports of the creature are now in the tens of thousands or more. Cases reach back hundreds of years and continue to the present day. While Bigfoot is reported all over the planet, the leading producer of cases is the state of California.

Native Americans have oral traditions about Sasquatch reaching back many hundreds of years. But it wasn’t until the mid-1850s that written reports began to be recorded. Initially reports came from prospectors, miners, hunters, and others. But as the population of California began to grow, so did the number of Bigfoot encounters.

While reports were coming in for more than 100 years, it wasn’t until a series of events occurred in 1967 in the small then unknown town of Bluff Creek in northern California that interest in the creature exploded. For the first time, the term “Bigfoot” came into use, and for the first time people began to scientifically study the creature.

While some people still remain skeptical of the creature’s existence, those who study the evidence usually come to the conclusion that Bigfoot is real. Even the famous anthropologist Jane Goodall has stated her belief that Bigfoot is real. The evidence comes in many forms including eyewitness testimony, footprints, handprints, hair samples, fecal and urine samples, animal reaction cases, sound recordings, Bigfoot nests, and of course, photographs and films.

California has produced cases involving the entire range of Bigfoot cases, both friendly and hostile. Perhaps the most common type of encounter is seeing a Bigfoot cross the road in front of a vehicle while traveling late at night along a remote highway. But many other reports exist of face-to-face Bigfoot encounters, Bigfoot chases, hunters shooting at Bigfoot, Bigfoot confronting hikers, campers, fisherman and more. Some people report being viciously attacked by Bigfoot, even including kidnappings. But some also report remarkably friendly encounters. A few testify that Bigfoot has even saved their life. Even stranger are accounts in which Bigfoot and UFOs are seen at the same time.

California has all these kinds of cases and more. People come from all over the world to visit such hotspots as Willow Creek, Bluff Creek and more. But what many people don’t know is that Bigfoot is seen all across the state, from the Sequoia and Redwood forests in the north, to the fertile central valley in the middle, the high deserts of Acton, Lancaster and Palmdale, the massive Angeles National Forest area, all the way south to the remote mountains surrounding San Diego. There is virtually no place in California that hasn’t produced solid Bigfoot reports.

This video presents more than 100 cases of Bigfoot in California. And while these are enough reports to gain a full understanding of Bigfoot behaviors and habitats, the truth is that this is only the tip of the iceberg. The number of reports in California alone is in the several thousands. And most people never even report their Bigfoot encounters. So any estimate of the number of the cases is probably far lower than the actual number. What we know about is just the tip of the iceberg.

The cases presented here show that California is very active with the mysterious creature known as Bigfoot and Sasquatch. If you’d like to know more about Bigfoot in California, check out the book, “Supernatural California,” which presents a comprehensive history of the creature, as well as many other strange mysteries in the Golden State.

UFO contact has occurred all over the world to all kinds of people. While some people report being very frightened by their encounters, others report encounters that are not only benevolent, but healing. In fact, ET healings are far more common than most people realize. There are literally hundreds of cases on record, reaching back over 100 years and still occurring to the present day. This video presents seven extraordinary examples of extraterrestrial healings involving people from all across the planet. These seven cases show how truly advanced ETs are when it comes to practicing medicine, and also show that healing humanity is main part of the alien agenda.

CASE ONE: TERRY WALTERS: Terry Walters of England reports a lifetime of unusual events. In 2005, Terry suffered from severe spinal problems and chronic back pain. That is, until he found himself in an operating room onboard a UFO. Even more surprising, he was being operated on by a reptilian humanoid. Following this, Walters' back pain was gone. Soon Walters began having more onboard experience with beautiful human-looking extraterrestrials. This initiated a spiritual awakening and Terry began experiencing ghost encounters, precognition of disasters, memories of a past-life as an Egyptian Pharoah and more. Walters also found he had the ability to heal others of a wide variety of medical conditions.

CASE TWO: JEAN MIGUERES. On August 11, 1969, Jean Migueres was driving his ambulance near Rouen, France when a UFO appeared overhead. He heard a voice mentally tell him, "Do not be afraid." Shortly later, Migueres suffered a head-on collision with another vehicle, causing massive injuries. While trapped in the wreckage, an alien being materialized next to him and said, "I am going to regenerate you by a procedure that is not yet known on your planet." The being proceeded to heal Migueres of injuries to his spine and more. Migueres was rushed to the hospital where he had three near-death experiences, but ultimately recovered. He began having regular onboard experiences and discovered that he had been given "the gift of healing," and found himself in telepathic contact with ETs.

CASE THREE: Connie Isele of Divide, CO began having unusual experiences from a very young age. ln 1989, she woke up to see strange praying mantis-like creatures. Initially terrified, Isele soon realized that the ETs were actually there to help. In 1989, the ETs visited her and healed her of uterine cramping. Three years later, they returned and healed her of arthritis in her knee. Three years after that, in 1995, Isele suffered a near-fatal auto accident. Doctors feared she would lose her leg. Isele prayed to the ETs for help, and to her amazement, they visited her in her hospital room and healed her. The doctors were shocked and gave Isele the nickname "miracle legs."

CASE FOUR: After learning that Pine Bush in upstate NY was a huge UFO hotspot, researcher Ellen Crystall traveled to the area and began not only seeing UFOs, but photographing them. Before long, she saw an actual ET. Her sightings were so numerous, she wondered if she might actually be a UFO contactee herself. Ellen learned that as a child, she had been very sick with an undiagnosed intestinal disorder. She became so sick, doctors feared she would die. But one day, she was miraculously healed. Later, she learned in an unusual way that she had actually been healed by ETs.

CASE FIVE: Jerry Wills of KY was only twelve years old when he began seeing UFOs and having contact with human-looking ETs who taught him a variety of scientific and spiritual subjects. Around that time, he became bedridden with a dangerously high fever. As he lay in bed, he was suddenly visited by grays who took him onboard a craft and healed him. As an adult, Wills found that he had developed incredible healing abilities. 

CASE SIX: IVAN MORALES. A police officer from Puerto Rico, in 1980 Morales found himself very sick with rheumatic fever. After praying for help, Morales was shocked to be visited by two gray ETs who took him onboard a craft and to an undersea base where they healed him, then returned him to his home.

CASE SEVEN: In 1998, four-year-old Gabriel Flores of Chile was near death from a severe case of rheumatic fever. While being driven to and from the hospital, he had a UFO encounter which left him completely healed. Flores' healing was confirmed by doctors, and soon the whole family began to experience incredible events which left them convinced that they were all in contact with ETs.

When it comes to UFOs, one of the most common assumptions is that ETs would land on the White House lawn and say, “Take me to your leader!” Ignoring the fact that UFOs have hovered over the White House at least twice, the truth is they have shown themselves to a wide variety of world leaders. Most people are probably unaware that presidents have seen UFOs, as have senators, representatives, governors and many other leaders across the United States and the world.

This video presents more than twenty world leaders who have had close encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials, reaching back to 1947, the Modern Age of UFOs all the way to the present day.

The United States has produced more than a dozen such cases.

Aug 1, 1947: Mayor Potter P. Howard of Boise, Idaho is on a United Airlines flight when he sees a flight of a dozen discs sweep below the jet.
Aug 5, 1952: Mayor H.A. Latham of Gainesville, Texas and two family members observe a massive cylindrical-shaped UFO darting overhead.
Sep 6, 1952: Congresswoman Isabella King of Arizona and her friend observe a whirling tear-shaped object while driving near Tucson.
Oct 4, 1955: Senator Richard Russell of Georgia and others observe two metallic discs while on a train-ride through Russia.
Nov 25, 1955: Colorado State Senator, Sam T. Taylor observes a glowing dirigible-shaped object perform incredible maneuvers.
Aug 10, 1963: Mayor Harrly L. Bishop of Mt. Vernon, Illinois watches a bright red UFO move down the street, then stop and hover over his home.
Apr 25, 1966: Governor Haydon Burns of Florida is flying over Orlando when everyone onboard the plane sees two glowing objects follow them.
Jan 6, 1969: Jimmy Carter, soon-to-be Governor and then President reports his sighting of a multi-colored object hovering at low elevation.
Sep 6, 1971: Congressman Malcolm Wallop (soon to be Senator) of Wyoming observes a fleet of a dozen objects leapfrogging in the sky.
Oct 1973: Governor John Gilligan of Ohio and his wife observe an amber-colored object which sends down a bright beam of light.
1974: Governor Ronald Reagan of California is flying over Bakersfield when he and the flight crew chase a UFO for several minutes.
Mar 5, 1977: an unnamed Senator of North Dakota (and his wife) are chased in their car by two low-flying UFOs.
1982: Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio sees a UFO while staying at the home of actress Shirley Maclaine in Graham, Washington.
Mar 13, 1997: Governor Fife Symington of Arizona is one of thousands of people who witness the massive Phoenix Lights display.
UFOs are a global phenomenon. So, it should come as no surprise that leaders all across the world are also seeing UFOs. What follows are a dozen more examples of extraordinary UFO encounters from world leaders across our planet.
Jul 9, 1952: Mayor Oscar Linke of Gleimershausen, Germany (and his daughter) come upon a landed UFO and occupants in the forest.
Sep 9, 1954: Mayor Raoul Laurent of Saint-Dizier, France is amazed to see a cigar-shaped craft move directly over City Hall.
1950s: Fidel Castro, soon to become the President of Cuba reports his sighting of an enormous round glowing object illuminating a wide area.
1956: President Hassan Rouhani of Iran (then only seven years old) is outside a mosque when a UFO lands directly in the mosque yard.
1973: President Idi Amin of Uganda (and many others) observe a UFO hover for seven minutes, then descend onto the surface of Lake Victoria.
1974: President Luis Echeverria of Mexico observes a gigantic UFO over the town of Cuernavaca. Other witnesses include Mayor Valentin Lopez Gonzalez of Cuernavaca and Governor Emilio Riva Palacio of Morelos.
Mar 1974, Mayor Petit of Rimogne, France sees a shiny, orange, oval disc hover overhead for ten minutes, then move off.
1975: Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy of Grenada sees a UFO, and is also involved in an apparent UFO/crash retrieval of a tall six-fingered ET.
1979: President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil (and Brazilian Amabassador Celso Furtado) see a glowing object hover over the sea.
Sep 18, 1997, President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov of the Republic of Kalmykia is taken onboard an ET craft to another planet and then returned.
These accounts from world leaders across the U.S. and the world are likely just a small sample of the actual number of cases. Most leaders who have encounters like these are likely keeping them secret. The time for truth and transparency on this subject is now! UFOs are clearly intentionally showing themselves to world leaders. It's time that our leaders start telling the truth about UFOs.

On September 19, 1961, a momentous event occurred which generated headlines across the world and forever changed the way humanity viewed the UFO phenomenon. While driving through the remote White Mountains of New Hampshire, a married couple by the name of Barney and Betty Hill encountered a UFO. The object descended low enough that Barney was able to see occupants looking down at him from the craft. As they sped away, the craft pursued them. The couple experienced about two hours of missing time, then returned to their home.

This incredible case introduced the world to the idea of UFO abductions. And before long, hundreds and then thousands of similar cases started pouring in from all over the world. The case is perhaps the most famous in UFO history. But what many people don’t know about is the fertilizer connection.

During their encounter, the Hills had a bag of fertilizer stored in their trunk. And when researchers began to look into their case, they asked the Hills if they had any nitrates of any kind in the vehicle when they were taken onboard. The investigators told them that they had researched other cases where there was a connection. The Hills were initially puzzled by the question, and they didn't understand what the researchers were getting at. Only then did they realize that yes, they did in fact have a bag of fertilizer in their car. Was there a connection?

The answer might be, yes! On April 24, 1964, dairy farmer, Gary T. Wilcox encountered a landed UFO and occupants on his farm in Newark Valley, outside of Tioga City, New York. He held a nearly two-hours-long conversation with the beings, during which the ETs explained that they were interested in studying agriculture and the use of fertilizer in his fields. They actually asked him for a bag of fertilizer, which Wilcox provided. The case drew the attention of UFO researchers. It's a strange case, but Wilcox's family and friends vouched for his honesty and integrity.

In this video, we explore these two cases and several others which point towards the ETs' interest in fertilizer. For example, there is the bizarre case of Mexican farmer, Jose Carmen Garcia, who became internationally famous for his ability to grow super-sized produce and vegetables. He grew ten-pound onions, sixty-pound cabbages and collard greens more than five feet long. Scientists and agricultural experts were amazed. When they asked what his secret was, Garcia shocked them by revealing that he had been given a "secret formula" from extraterrestrials. As strange as this sounded, people had no choice but to believe him, because Garcia was able to provide the gargantuan vegetables as proof.

More cases exist, such as an anonymous gentleman who reported his sighting of a UFO moving over the Agrium Fertilizer Plant in Borger, Texas in 1988.

Another case is that of a young girl from Winsted, Connecticut who woke up one evening to watch a UFO land outside her home and disgorge several short humanoids who proceeded to investigate the building across the street. It turned out that this building was being used to store large amounts of fertilizer. 

There's also the case of an anonymous gentleman from Lee's Summit, Missouri who, after having several sightings in the area, decided to investigate. He discovered that the sightings seemed to be correlated to the use of fertilizer. Says the witness, "“One of the commonalities is that they appear in areas which are rich in phosphorus such as certain coast water, and other waterways which have runoff from fertilizer."

These are just a few of the many cases pointing toward a strange ET-fertilizer connection. This is an area of UFO contact that has never been explored in depth, and provides some interesting insights into the behavior of UFOs and their occupants.

<p>In January of 1973, a fourteen-year-old girl named Dolly Safran woke up to the fact that she was having regular visitations with extraterrestrials. Prior to this, she had ignored, denied or explained away her encounters. But now, after a profound onboard UFO experience, she knew the truth. She was a UFO contactee. She was having regular visits with extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>This began her lifelong relationship with ETs, during which she was taken onboard and taught many subjects, including biology, astronomy, chemistry, morality, ethics, spirituality and much more. Given the opportunity to work directly with them, Dolly chose to focus on learning how to fly the craft.</p>

<p>Dolly was visited more than a hundred times each year, and she began having mind-boggling adventures with the ETs. Among the most startling and amazing, was being taken beyond our solar system to visit other worlds.</p>

<p>In Part One of these interviews, Dolly shared her childhood experiences up to age fourteen. In Part Two: Dolly presented the incredible photographic evidence she was able to obtain. In Part Three, she talked about the many different kinds of ETs she has visited. Now, in Part Four of this ongoing series of interviews, Dolly Safran shares her incredible ventures of travelling to other worlds.</p>

Dolly has had the wonderful opportunity to visit many of the worlds within our own solar system, but even more astonishing are her visits to many planets orbiting other suns. One such visit involved a trip to a small rocky world that was nearing the end of its life-cycle. Dolly was taken there with several other contactees and was shown firsthand how every world goes through various evolutionary stages, finally resulting in the death of that planet.

On several occasions, Dolly was taken to a massive water planet whose surface was almost entirely oceans, but was dotted with countless small islands. It was a planet filled with life of all kinds, and there Dolly learned that there was a symmetry to life throughout the universe, and that the flora and fauna on each planet followed a basic template. The planet was also home to at least two intelligent species of humanoids. Dolly was able to meet them both and even became good friends with a human-looking ET girl.

More adventures followed. Over a period of many years, Dolly was taken repeatedly to a planet that was being slowly consumed and destroyed by its own sun, which was in the process of going nova. On the final visit, she was taken to see the world become torn apart and the sun explode into a fantastic supernova. 

Dolly describes her visits to many other worlds, gas giants, water planets and more. Among the most fantastic were her visits to massive alien Dyson Spheres, huge artificial planetoids constructed by the ETs and used as waystations and outposts. Dolly was taken inside and shown how the ETs preserve countless species of both plants and animals from across the universe.

Dolly also shares how she was given the unique opportunity to visit the Voyager Space Probes and get a close-up view of these human-made spacecraft traveling far beyond Earth.

Finally, Dolly shares how she was given a front-row view to one of the most historic and dramatic astronomical events in the history of our own solar system: the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy with the planet Jupiter. While astronomers on Earth viewed the event through telescopes, Dolly was taken onboard a UFO craft and saw the comet collision occur right before her very eyes.

These are just a few of the many events Dolly has experienced with the ETs. Her lifelong experiences include many other adventures and explorations that have taken her to the farthest reaches of the known universe. If you'd like to learn more about Dolly's experiences, her account is told in my book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure." Now available!

UFOs often behave in ways that can only be described as bizarre. One type of behavior that is familiar to most UFO investigators are UFO-car chases. In case after case, UFOs will approach a car driving down a remote highway late at night and chase them down the road. But there’s another type of behavior that goes far beyond just chasing a car. Sometimes UFOs will actually pull the car off the road and suck it up into the sky! These are known as “car-lift” cases.

For some reason, the UFO occupants just pull the car up, float it around and then set it back down, leaving the people in the car bewildered and more than a little frightened. The question is, why? The best way to get some answers is to examine the cases. This video present more than twenty UFO car-lift cases, reaching back more than sixty years up to the present day, and coming from all across our planet.

1959: four teenagers are driving outside of Goldfield, NV when their truck becomes mired in the desert sand. To their amazement, a UFO shows up and pulls their truck out.

1961: Adolpho Pisano is driving along the Andean Highway in Venezuela. Suddenly a UFO swoops down and pulls the car ahead of him into the sky.

1965: Mrs. A.V. of Brussels, Belgium loses control of her vehicle as a UFO lifts it up and carries it 150 feet forward before setting it down again.

1965: Edward Burns of Herman, MN is only two miles from his home when he comes upon a glowing red object over the road. Before he can get away, the object levitates his pickup truck and spins it 180-degrees on the highway.

1967: Martha Carnes is driving down Chicken Run Road in Madison, Indiana when a UFO (which had chased her car twice before) came after her again. This time it comes over her car and pulls it up off the ground.

1969: Barbara Smythe of Alberta, Canada sees a 40-foot-wide object over her car, then realizes that her car is floating off the road. The UFO proceeds to float her car for a full mile.

1971: Wilton Raweater and his wife are heading to their home on the Blackfeet Reservation in Alberta, Canada. A light appears overhead and Mrs. Raweater cries out, "The car has left the ground!" The UFO carries the car two feet above the road for a quarter mile.

1973: two couples leave a party in Hattiesburg, MS when a UFO swoops down and proceeds to lift their car upward and drop it down on the road over and over again.

1974: two brothers driving a Uhaul truck north of Ely, NV encounter multiple UFOs, one of which comes right above their vehicle and carries it upward.

1974: A farmer in Hobbs, NM arrives home just in time for his family to witness him being carried upwards, pickup and all, into a flying saucer.

1978: Clora Winscher is driving through Union, MO when a UFO comes down and lifts up the back end of her car, forcing her to drive only on the front two wheels!

1978: Carlos Acevedo and Miguel Moya of Buenos Aires, Argentina drop out of an auto race, only to have a UFO come down and carry their car six feet above the road for several miles.

1983: Catherine Burk of Altoona, PA encounters a silver saucer which lifts her car up on its two left wheels.

1986: An anonymous couple in Lucca, Italy drive under a triangular-shaped object which lifts up only the back end of their car.

1988: The Knowles family are driving late at night along the Nullarbor Plain in Australia when an egg-shaped object lands on their roof and pulls their car a few meters off the road.

1992: A couple is driving through Topanga Canyon, CA when a saucer-shaped object comes fifty feet over their car and levitates it into the sky.

1994: "Alan" from Rio Grande County in CO is with his friend mentally calling a UFO when it lifts their pick-up truck off the ground and throws it across the road.

1995: an anonymous gentleman from Rio Grande, CO has a close encounter with an object which levitates his big rig truck and trailer right off the highway.

1999: a resident of Elko, NV exits his truck on the highway to observe a UFO. Seeing that it's heading toward him, he hops back into his truck to flee, only to realize that his truck is now floating six feet in the air.

2010: Two young teenagers park at the local lover's lane in Laconia, NH when a UFO comes and pulls their car vertically into the sky.

As can be seen, there is no shortage of UFO car-lift cases. All over the world, ETs are chasing cars down the highway and pulling them up into the sky. Some of these cases result in missing time or an onboard experience. But many seem to be more of a display, or a way for the ETs to announce their presence in an absolutely undeniable way.

A ghost encounter can elicit a wide variety of emotions. They can be funny, sad, scary, awe-inspiring...and some can be downright creepy! This video presents three really creepy ghost stories, the kind that sends little icy shivers down your spine.

CASE ONE: THE GHOST THAT CAME TO BED. Shortly after moving into their new home in Merced, California, Sally Sanders (pseudonym) began to experience weird activity. Her husband never noticed anything strange, not at first. But Sally did. Late one evening, she woke up to feel someone climbing into her bed. But when she looked, nobody was there! She first thought it might have been her imagination, and that it would never happen again. But it did. A few weeks later, she again woke up to feel the mattress press down and the bedsheets rustle. But when she looked, nobody was there. As she always did when this happened, she fled the bedroom and slept elsewhere in the house.

It happened again and again, and Sally grew increasingly concerned. She knew that she had to take action. She decided to try an experiment. Knowing that the ghost always crawled into bed in the same spot, she moved the bed. This, she hoped, would stop the weird events from happening. Instead, it caused the haunting to escalate. It wasn't long after that when Sally not only felt the ghost crawl into bed with her, but this time it physically touched her!

Sally and her husband decided to move. But the ghost wasn't done with them yet. About two weeks before they moved away, the ghost attacked, crushing and trying to suffocate Sally as she lay in bed. It was the single most terrifying experience of her life.

CASE TWO: A VISION OF BLOOD. In the 1980s, Dorothy Hudson worked in a business office in Los Angeles. One of Dorothy's co-workers was Margery, (pseudonym), a bill-collector. Dorothy and Margery did not get along. One day the two of them got into a disagreement. The next morning, Margery was supposed to go pick up a debtor's check in Van Nuys, and come back to the office afterward. But Margery never showed up at the office.

Meanwhile, Dorothy was at the office and went to visit the restroom. Walking inside, she was shocked to see that the clean white tiles of the bathroom were dripping with blood. It was all over the walls and floors. Blood was everywhere. Dorothy blinked it shock. And when she looked again, it was gone.

A short time later, Dorothy answered the office phone. It was Margery's husband asking for Margery. Dorothy explained that his wife was supposed to pick up a check, but that she had failed to return to the office. "Oh, my God, no!" Margery's husband cried.

"What's wrong?" Dorothy asked. Margery's husband explained that he wasn't sure, but he had just received a call from the police, and he hung up the phone. A few hours later he called back with devastating news. Margery had been killed. She had been run over by a truck after picking up the check. Dorothy's boss visited the accident location and learned that Margery's body had been crushed under the wheels of the truck, and that blood was all over her car, the street and the sidewalk. The time of the accident was about the same time Dorothy had seen the vision of blood in the bathroom. Somehow, Dorothy had picked up on the terrible tragedy. It was an experience that sent chills down her spine and left her pale and shaken.

CASE THREE: A BROTHER'S GHOST. In the early 1970s, Tom and his older brother Jeffrey (pseudonyms) lived in a modest home with their parents in Los Angeles, California. The two of them were very close. Jeffrey had recently fallen in love with a woman and was about to get married. Then tragedy struck. Jeffrey was in a tragic car accident and died of his injuries at the scene. The entire family was devastated, but Tom was perhaps the most affected.

He spiraled into a deep depression. The senseless death of his older brother, whom he loved and idolized, was an event which left him with a crushing sadness. He just couldn't understand why his brother had been taken from him. Life no longer seemed worth living. 

Then one day, Tom ventured into his brother's room, sat on the bed, and began to play some of Jeffrey's rock music. Jeffrey loved to sit in his hanging chair and listen to rock music. A favorite song of his was "Comfortably Numb," by Pink Floyd. Tom decided to play that song and reminisce about the all the good times he had with Jeffrey. That's when it happened: the hanging chair began to swing back and forth by itself! Tom soon learned that he could call on his brother's spirit anytime he wanted.

These three cases show how ghosts can manifest in a wide variety of ways. If you'd like to learn more, check out my book, California Ghosts. Now available!

UFOs come in a dazzling array of shapes and sizes. Saucer-shaped craft, egg-shaped, spherical-shaped, teardrops, triangles, cigars...you name it! The true number of cases is far larger than most people realize. UFOs are seen all over the world by all kinds of people.

This video presents a decade of sightings, stretching from 1947 to 1957, all involving firsthand witnesses who provide sketches of what they saw. It has been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And this is especially true when it comes to UFOs. Sometimes the UFO craft are so strange, unusual and unique, that people are unable to find the words to describe them. A simple sketch is not only helpful in describing a UFO, it is often essential. A drawing is able to convey information in a way that words simply cannot do.

Fifty cases with eyewitness drawings, each providing another piece of the puzzle, and each offering new insights into the nature and origin of UFOs. These cases show that the UFO phenomenon is global and ongoing. They also show how our own governments have attempted to cover-up UFO information, offering debunking explanations to encounters that they know are absolutely genuine. They show how the Air Force's Project Blue Book was not a true investigative body, but was instead an attempt to deny the truth about the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.

Did you know that children comprise a significant number of UFO witnesses? There are many reasons for this. One is that children are usually outside more than adults. Also, children are more likely to report their encounters than are adults. A third reason is that UFO contact often begins early in childhood. As evidenced by the many cases of schoolyard UFO encounters, ETs like to show themselves to children. Unfortunately, children are often disbelieved or not taken seriously. Therefore, it's likely that the actual numbers of kids contact UFOs is higher than most people think.

This video presents three incredible cases of kids who have had UFO encounters. Each of these cases involves multiple witnesses and various forms of evidence such as electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects and landing traces. Under the J. Allen Hynek system, these would be classified as Close Encounters of the Second and Third Kind. In other words, these are not simple sightings, but very close encounters in which the environment is affected in some way, and/or involve humanoids.

CASE ONE: THE CASA BLANCA ENCOUNTER. On the afternoon of August 22, 1955, a group of eight children were playing outside their homes in the Casa Blanca area of Riverside, California. Looking up, the children saw a silver spinning disc swooping down from above. As the children watched, the object disappeared and reappeared several times. Suddenly there were multiple objects of different shapes and sizes, some emitting a strange musical pinging sound. Without warning, one of the objects (described as the size of three homes) landed in a nearby field. A strange-looking humanoid being stepped out and began beckoning at the kids to go onboard.  For the next hour or two, pandemonium ensued as the children interacted with the UFOs and the strange being. Some of the children came very close to going onboard, but were held back by their friends. Strangely, two adults were present for at least part of the encounter, but could not see anything! Reporters and UFO researchers converged to investigate the case. There was no evidence of a hoax, and the case remains unexplained to this day.

CASE TWO: KIDS BUZZED BY A UFO. On the evening of February 24, 1959, a young high school student was babysitting his little brother in their home in Victorville, California. Without warning, a weird buzzing sound filled the air, and the house began to vibrate. The radio in the house became filled with static and the dogs outside started to bark furiously. Running outside, the witness was amazed to see a large UFO craft swoop down directly over his house at a height of only ten feet. Moments later, the UFO returned, swooping down again, coming even lower. Terrified, the witness ran inside to grab his gun and protect his home. For the next few minutes, the UFO swooped down over their home at least five times before finally accelerating off into the distance. The boys' parents arrived home to find their children hiding inside, and their two dogs shaking and cowering in fear. They contacted authorities to report the incident. Air Force intelligence officers from Project Blue Book arrived, and after interviewing the witnesses, declared the case genuine. They discovered that the neighbors experienced unexplained static on their TV sets. Unable to explain the case, Project Blue Book labeled the case unidentified: Case #1140.

CASE THREE: THE LEMON GROVE UFO LANDING. On November 6, 1973, Richard T. and Daniel F (age eleven) were exploring the fields near their homes in Lemon Grove, California. To their amazement, they came upon a strange object landed in the field. It was metallic, saucer-shaped with a dome on top and covered with colored lights. Wondering what it might be, they walked right up to it and knocked on the side with their flashlight. The object immediately lit up and began to rotate and rise upward. Terrified, the kids turned and ran, but found that they were moving in slow motion. They watched the craft accelerate upwards and disappear into the clouds. Running home, they told their parents what happened. Investigators were called in who, upon examining the site, found strange landing traces. The hard-packed clay ground had strange holes in it, and the grass beneath the craft was swirled. Investigators then learned that several neighbors reported strange interference on their televisions and radios. Also, the phone lines in the area were fused together and had to be replaced. 

These three California cases show that a close encounter with an extraterrestrial can happen without warning, when you least expect it. If you would like to learn more about these cases and others, check out my book, "UFOs over California."

Healings are a consistent feature of UFO encounters, and they are more common than most people realize. Cases reach back more than 100 years and come from across the world. They cover a wide variety of injuries, illnesses and diseases. Most major UFO researchers have multiple cases. This video presents five true cases of people who have been healed by extraterrestrials.

CASE ONE: DIPHTHERIA. From researcher David Jacobs, Ph.D., in 1962, Alice Haggerty of Trenton, New Jersey was struck with the sometimes fatal disease diphtheria. For religious reasons, her parents had not inoculated her against the disease. When her condition worsened, they called in a doctor who cared for her as best as he could. Unfortunately, Alice's condition deteriorated. Alice became so sick that she was not expected to live through the night. On that evening, Alice was visited by ETs, taken onboard and healed. The next morning, she was fully recovered, amazing both her parents and the doctor.

CASE TWO: HERNIA. In 2000, Jim Law from Gainesville, Florida developed an inguinal hernia. After being diagnosed by a specialist, Jim elected to have surgery. However, before the surgery, he was visited by three gray ETs. Jim asked the grays to heal him, and to his surprise, they said, “We know of the condition you have a concern about and will help you.” Which they did! Jim then asked them why they had contacted him, and the grays said, "We are interested in you because you have the genetic potential to live a long time.” Jim was fascinated because longevity was in his family. At the time, his grandfather was 106 years old, and his aunt and great grandmother both lived to 109.

CASE THREE: SEPARATED ACHILLES TENDON. In 2005, Michael Thomas Knox (a former Air Force officer) attended the MUFON UFO conference in Irvine, California. At the time, he had been diagnosed with a separated Achilles tendon. Doctors told him that he required surgery to repair his condition. However, while staying at the conference, Knox was visited in his hotel room by three grays who performed surgery on him. Knox had no memory of this, but his roommate saw it all. She reported that they were both taken onboard a craft as were several other people at the conference. They received further confirmation of the event the next morning when they discovered strange bruises and marks, and also unexplained fluorescent stains in their hotel room. Also, another group of witnesses reported seeing a UFO hovering directly over the hotel that evening!

CASE FOUR: BODY INJURIES. In 1960, electrical engineer, Vlado Victor Kapetanovic was hunting in the Callejon de Hauylas region of rural Peru. Traveling with a guide, they both had multiple sightings of strange metallic discs zipping through the sky. They came upon a remote village of native Peruvians and discovered that a young boy had recently fallen off a cliff and was suffering from severe injuries which had left him comatose and on the edge of death. Victor offered to transport the boy to a hospital many miles away. The parents refused, saying that the "sky gods" would come and heal the boy. Victor's guide explained that the people of the village were regularly visited by ETs who took care of them. And sure enough, a short time later, a UFO landed, and a beautiful human-looking figure exited the craft. She scooped up the boy and took him inside the craft. Shortly later, the boy came out perfectly healed. Victor verified the healing and then spoke with the ET woman. She invited him onboard the craft. This began a series of contacts with the ETs which altered the course of Victor's life.

CASE FIVE: In 1971, Gilbert Camus, a radio engineer from Gevingey, France was driving along the highway near the village of Trenal when he encountered a landed UFO and more than 20 strange-looking figures. Gilbert was then struck by a beam of light which took control of his car, slowing its speed to a crawl. A short time later, the beam retracted, and Gilbert continued on his way. Arriving home, Gilbert found strange marks on his body and his underclothes. Returning to the site of the encounter the next day, he found strange depressions and melted ice. Also, the paint on his Peugeot began to fade. Most amazing, at the time of the encounter, Gilbert was suffering from chronic liver disease. His condition was causing loss of appetite and unbearably painful headaches. However, following the encounter, his health problems disappeared. He had been healed!

These five cases are just a tiny portion of the more than 300 healings on record. One of the primary ET missions is the healing of humanity. If you would like to learn more about these cases and others, check out my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs." Now available!

A ghostly encounter is one of the most commonly reported types of paranormal experiences. Ghosts can manifest in a wide variety of ways, including opening and closing doors, moving objects, turning lights on and off, phantom footsteps, cold-spots, unexplained odors, full-color apparitions and much more. Sometimes a home or specific structure is haunted, but other times a haunting can encompass a much larger area.

This video presents two cases of large-scale hauntings, both involving numerous firsthand witnesses encountering ghosts over a wide area with a large variety of paranormal manifestations.

The first case has come to be known as "The White Witch." This case takes place near the Oakland/El Sobrante area of northern California. There are a few different versions explaining the actual origins of the haunting, but most people report the same type of manifestation: a ghostly apparition of a tall glowing lady who wanders the areas of Alvarado Park, Tilden Park and Joaquin Miller Park. Although the case has become something of a local urban legend, there are numerous reported accounts of people who claim to have seen the apparition.

One group of witnesses involves five young men who had a hostile encounter with the White Witch in 1990. It was an encounter that left them badly frightened and convinced them forever that the White Witch is very real indeed.

The second case in this video is "The Ghosts of the Indian Burial Ground." This case takes in place Topanga Canyon, located in the Santa Monica Mountains adjacent to Los Angeles, California. The center of the haunting is at the entrance of Topanga State Park, the former location of a Chumash Native American settlement and alleged burial ground. The haunting has affected at least six separate homes and a part of the Trippet Ranch/Topanga State Park. The haunting activity reaches back several decades and is still going on today. The activity includes strange noises, moving objects, ghostly footsteps, weird presences, apparitions and more. The haunting is very well-known among the local residents, most who have remained quiet about what is going on.

These two locations are good examples of on-going active hauntings, and if anyone wants to experience a ghost, both locations are open to the public. To explore more about these hauntings and many others, check out my book, "California Ghosts: True Accounts of Hauntings in the Golden State," published by Schiffer Books. Now available!

Dolly Safran, a nurse and Army D.O.D employee from Florida, has experienced a lifetime of UFO contact. While her experiences were initially shrouded in missing time, at age fourteen she experienced an encounter that would change her life forever. From that point on, Dolly remembered her UFO contacts fully consciously. She has since had thousands of contacts and experienced a wide variety of encounters.

In Part One of this series, we explored Dolly's encounters up to age fourteen. In Part Two, we presented the many UFO photographs and films Dolly was able to capture. Now, in Part Three, we now explore the many different types of extraterrestrials Dolly has encountered.

Among the most common type of ETs Dolly has encountered are the A.I. grays. These are small three-foot-tall biological android-like beings who function as workers. They assist in the transportation of humans to and from the ET craft and carry out many other duties. They are not living beings with souls, but they can function autonomously. They can also be used by the ETs as avatars.

Dolly has also encountered tall grays, mid-sized grays and small grays. These are biological beings, with genetics. They eat, sleep and have all the biological functions of human beings. Dolly's main ET liason is a tall gray she calls "Momma." Dolly met Momma when she was only six years old and is still in contact with her today.

Many contactees describe small blue troll-like beings about three-feet in height. Dolly has met these as well, and says that they are a variation of the commonly described grays. They often work with young children and help to reduce the fear factor often associated with UFO contact.

On one occasion, Dolly had the rare opportunity to see two dog-like ETs, very similar in description to the Egyptian figure known as Anubis. These beings were more than six feet tall, broad-shouldered, muscular and covered with fur.

On another rare occasion, Dolly was able to visit with cat-like ETs. Described very much as humanoid cats, these beings are short, covered with fur and quite solitary. Dolly had only a brief encounter with them, but it was quite close-up, and left a deep impression on her.

Periodically during her onboard UFO encounters, Dolly has interacted with the beings known as Tall Whites. These ETs are very stern and serious. They are tall and can reach well over ten or fifteen feet in height. They have only limited contact with humans and usually keep to themselves.

Dolly has had many interactions with human-looking ETs, often described as Nordics. These beings are very much like us, and have the same variations we have on our own planet. On several occasions, Dolly has interacted with Misha, a young girl from another planet. Misha, says Dolly, looks very much like the people from the indigenous population of Polynesia. 

Dolly has also encountered humanoid beings who spend much of their time in the water. They have webbed hands and feet and are able to remain underwater for long periods of time.

On a few occasions, Dolly has been taken to see third-dimensional light beings who are able to transcend the physical world and travel into the higher dimensions. These are very powerful beings with very strong paranormal abilities.

Another amazing encounter Dolly experienced was with a nine-foot-tall praying mantis being. This encounter occurred in the backyard of a rural farm in Georgia. The being told Dolly that they are the Watchers and that they came to check on her following a very delicate medical procedure that she had undergone days earlier.

Among the most fantastic beings Dolly has encountered are the so-called Anunnaki. These winged beings are very tall, strong and powerful. Dolly only met them once when she was a little girl, but the encounter was one she will never forget.

Dolly's case is one of the most extensive accounts of UFO contact on record. She has spent days and weeks at a time among the ETs and has learned vast amounts of knowledge from them. The ETs, Dolly says, are very much like us. Her experiences have taught her that there is life throughout the universe, and that we are only a small part of a vast network of living beings that exist among the billions of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond.

If you would like to learn more about Dolly's experiences, check out my book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure," a number one Amazon UFO best-seller. Now available!

While seeing a UFO is undeniably interesting, far more compelling are cases of UFO 
landings. In these cases, the extraterrestrial craft are observed from a short 
distance, virtually removing any chance of misperception. This video presents seven 
cases from across the United States involving dramatic UFO landings.

CASE ONE: UFO LANDING AT ELY.  On June 25, 1964, two brothers were driving from Spring 
Valley to the town of Ely, Nevada. At some point during the trip, they came upon an 
object landed directly in the center of the road. George stopped the car and attempted 
to walk up to the object, causing a surprising reaction from the UFO occupants.

CASE TWO: THE UFO HOUSE. One evening in December 2012, an anonymous couple from Sierra 
Vista, Arizona stepped outside their home to do some stargazing. Looking at a fenced-in 
field next to their home, they were amazed to see what appeared to be a small strange-
looking structure with only a few windows. It was odd because it hadn't been there 
earlier in the day. How had it appeared? Puzzled, they didn't think much of it until 
morning arrived, and they saw something they couldn't understand.

CASE THREE:  LANDING IN LUKACHUKAI: One evening in mid-August 1982, three men were 
driving to the Lukachukai Rodeo in Arizona when they saw a start-like object swoop 
towards them from above. Later on during the drive, they saw that the object had 
apparently landed in a ravine alongside the road. They exited the car and observed 
the object. But as they drove to their location, they were soon to learn that they 
were not the only witnesses.

CASE FOUR:  UFO LANDING IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. In mid-June of 1955, Ted 
Kittredge was drawn outside his home by the sound of his dogs barking. To his 
amazement, he saw that a gigantic gold-colored sphere had landed in his front 
yard. Even more incredible, standing next to it were three seven-foot-tall 
human-looking ETs who had a message they wanted to share.   Todd was even more 
amazed when he learned that numerous other people in the area reported the same 
type of encounter.

CASE FIVE: THE OLD WISE ONES. Growing up on a 3000-acre ranch about fifty miles west 
of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Michael (pseudonym) experienced a series of UFO 
encounters, culminating in a UFO encounter during which he met a group of seven-
foot-tall beings. Michael described them as "very gentle and loving" and says 
that they give him an important message and warning for all humanity.

CASE SIX: UFO LANDING AT LAS CRUCES. In the summer of 1952, Hilda McAfee and her 
mother were traveling along Highway 10 from Las Cruces to their home in Deming, 
New Mexico. Suddenly they saw a blinding blue light ahead of them in the road. 
Slowing down, they saw a large object landed in the road, and next to it stood 
two strange-looking humanoids. It was an encounter that would leave them both 
shaken, not only mentally, but physically.

CASE SEVEN: UFO LANDING IN CONKLIN. On July 16, 1964, Mrs. Travis was in her home 
in Conklin, New York, when her two sons, Edmund (age nine) and Randy (age seven), 
and their three friends announced that they had seen a spaceman, and needed to 
bring him a jar of water. When questioned about this, the children said a silvery 
object had landed in the field, and a short humanoid approached them. Questioned 
separately by the adults, the children stuck to their story.

These seven cases are just a few of the many, many UFO landing cases on record. If 
you would like to learn more about these cases and many others, check out my books, 
"UFOs over Arizona," "UFOs over Colorado," "UFOs over Nevada," "UFOs over New Mexico," 
and "UFOs over New York."

Jesus walking on water in the Sea of Galilee is a very well-known miraculous event. And of course, there is the account of Buddha performing the same wondrous talent. Although these men both lived thousands of years ago, their incredible feats are still remembered today. But what many people don't realize is that there are dozens of cases from many different cultures throughout history in which people have walked on water. Some of these accounts were widely viewed by outside witnesses and are surprisingly well-verified.

For example, in the year 350, St. Ammon of Egypt was viewed by his disciple to float over a river.

In the 4th century, Saint Bessarion reportedly walked across the Nile, the Takazze River and the Barada River.

Another early case is Raymond of Pennafort, confessor to King James I of Aragon. Raymond was seen by hundreds of spectators to travel from the Island of Mayorca to Barcelona, a distance of 160 miles, using only his cloak as a flotation device. Many sailors observed this event, and Raymond's arrival on the shore was observed by a crowd of hundreds.

Many of the early cases involve various saints. In the 6th century, Maurus rescued Saint Placid from drowning in a lake in Subiaco, Italy. Maurus ran across the surface of the lake and retrieved Placid. Only upon returning to the shore did he realize that he had actually walked on water.

In 1430, Blessed Alvarez of Cordova, Italy joined the list of people who have walked on water when he was seen walking across a flooded river to reach his monastery. 

 In the early 1500s, Saint Peter of Alcantara was observed to walk across the Guadiana River in Spain. 

Aso in the 1500s, Saint Seraphino was seen walking across the Potenza River in Italy.

One of the most remarkable and widely viewed accounts of walking on water occurred in the 1700s to Saint Gerard of Majella, who was seen by a crowd of hundreds of people to walk on water in order to rescue a small boat that was sinking off the coast of Italy.

While many of the early cases involve saints, accounts come from all over the world from a wide variety of people of different cultures.

In the 1800s, "Dengnabine," a well-known Azande Medicine Man from Africa was observed to walk on water.

Another famous case from the 1800s is that of Mademoiselle Frederica Hauffe of France, also known as the Seer of Provorst. She displayed numerous psychic abilities, among them one instance of walking on water.

Two saints from Russia, Saint Basil (1800s) and Saint Zachary (1900s) were both seen by witnesses to walk on water.

An amusing and modern case occurred on July 18, 1837 to an eight-year-old Russian boy named Nikolai Yurlov. On that evening, Nikolai was woken up by a ghostly apparition. He became so frightened that he fled his home in terror and actually ran across the surface of the Sviyaga River. Servants who were chasing the boy were shocked to find Nikolai on the other side of the river, completely dry.

In 1894, explorer and researcher Baird T. Spaulding traveled with a group of men to study the miracles of Enlightened Masters from the Far East. While visiting India, they met a group of Yogis who took them on a journey to the foothills of the Himalayas. Spaulding and his companions observed a group of a dozen yogis traverse a large river by walking on the surface of the water. The yogis explained that with the proper training, anyone could learn to attain this ability.

One of the most unusual cases of this kind comes from Angelo Faticoni of Jacksonville, Florida. Also called "The Human Cork" and "The Man They Could Not Drown." Faticoni repeatedly demonstrated his ability to stay afloat on the surface of the water for hours at a time in virtually any position. He could stay on the surface lying on his side, his back or curled up in a ball. He could even sleep on the water. He was able to swim long distances. He subjected himself to numerous experiments including allowing himself to be tied down with weights or sewn into a sac. Still he remained on the surface of the water. Scientists from Harvard University studied his case and were unable to explain Faticoni's amazing ability.

These are just a few of the many cases of people who have displayed this unusual ability to walk on water. French researcher Olivier Leroy lists many other saints with this ability. Can humans walk on water? The answer is apparently yes!

UFO researchers have known for a very long time that UFOs are attracted to military bases. In fact, pioneering investigators Jim and Coral Lorenzen knew this, and when new military installations were built, they predicted sightings would occur there. And they were right!

The state of California has the largest population of any state, and according to NUFORC (the National UFO Reporting Center,) it also produces more UFO reports than any other states. California also has a very large number of highly advanced and sensitive military bases. So, it should come as no surprise that many of these installations have been visited by UFOs. In fact, sightings stretch all the way back to at least 1947, The Modern Age of UFOs, and are continuing today. 

This video presents about a dozen high profile cases of UFOs surveilling California military bases. These are not random sightings of lights in the sky at night. Many of these cases involve solid, metallic objects, and some are seen over a period of days. Many bases have been repeatedly visited for years on end. A few of the cases involve confirmed radar returns, and several of them were declared unidentified by intelligence officers from the Air Force's Project Blue Book.

  <li>July 3, 1947, Santa Rosa Naval Auxiliary Station goes on high alert when a 20-foot metallic saucer hovers a mere 1000 feet above the base runway.</li>
  <li>July 29, 1947, Hamilton Field experiences the first of a series of dramatic encounters over the base occurring over a period of five years.</li>
  <li>March 3, 1951, UFO activity at McClellan Air Force Base is so brazen that Blue Book officers investigate and are forced to label the case Unknown.</li>
  <li>May 1952, a month-long series of low-level daylight sightings of metallic objects over George AFB causes alarm at high levels of government.</li>
  <li>July 24, 1952, several military personnel at Travis Air Force base report a UFO. Blue Book officers arrive, and again are unable to identify the objects.</li>
  <li>January 28, 1953, control tower operators at El Toro Marine Base (and at nearby bases) try to intercept a fiery red disc hovering over the base.</li>
  <li>November 3, 1953, a witness identified only as "J" observes and photographs a UFO hovering at low levels above Norton Air Force Base.</li>
  <li>February 2, 1955, concerns are raised when numerous officers at Miramar Naval Air Station see a UFO, and Blue Book has no idea what it is!</li>
  <li>1956, a cat-and-mouse confrontation between UFOs and USAF jet fighters occurs over Castle AFB. The pilots are ordered to remain silent.</li>
  <li>September 15, 1964, an Atlas Missile is launched from Vandenberg AFB, causing a UFO incident that will make waves for decades to come.</li>
  <li>December 16, 1966, a crowd of military officers at San Diego Naval Air Station observe multiple objects perform gymnastics over the base.</li>
  <li>February 8, 1990, residents outside of Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Base observe and photograph an incredible encounter.</li>
</ul>

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Edwards Air Force Base has a history of UFO encounters that rival perhaps any other military base in the United States. Clearly something profound is happening here. The reports coming from highly reputable trained observers within our own military can be ignored no longer. The time for lies and cover-ups is over. The truth must be revealed. These cases show that UFOs and extraterrestrials are watching our technological progress very closely. They are letting our military know that we are being watched.

Since recorded history, people of all cultures across the world report seeing ghosts. They represent some of the best evidence we have for existence after death. But what many people don't know is that there are different kinds of ghosts.

For example, a typical ghost is simply an earthbound soul, someone who has remain attached to the Earthly plane. Ghosts remain earthbound for a variety of reasons. They might not realize they have passed on. They might be attached to a place or a person. They may suffer from confusion or addictions. Ghosts are responsible for the many haunted places across our planet

Then there are spirits. These are people who have passed on to the Other Side. They are aware that they are deceased and are no longer attached to the Earthly planes. Instead, they come to visit, usually with a purpose. They come to let their loved ones know that they are fine, to guide people, or to dispense information.

Then there are demons and poltergeists. Researchers are unsure about the origins of these entities. Some believe they are the result of psychokinetic energy from an emotionally disturbed person; others believe they are the result of uncontrolled mediumship, and others believe they are inhuman malevolent spirits. They can range from mischievous to downright evil.

This video presents three true accounts, one involving a ghost, one involving a spirit, and one involving a demon.

CASE ONE: THE GHOST WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE. Sarah first became aware of the ghost in her house when she heard an old man coughing. After several instances of this, she told her sister and mother, neither who believed her. Soon more events occurred. And then one day, Sarah not only heard coughing, she heard footsteps walk to the bathroom, then the door opened and closed, the ghost spit in the toilet and flushed it. Sarah ran screaming from the house. Still, neither her sister nor mother ever heard anything. Years passed with only occasional activity. One day they moved out and rented the house. Then one day the tenants called. They had experienced an event that left them baffled. Somebody had answered the phone. The problem was, the wife was alone in the house, and it wasn't her!

CASE TWO: A HAND ACROSS DEATH. One morning, Connie Lopez woke in her bedroom to find a strange mystery. An oily handprint had been left on her shower. She kept spotlessly clean house, so it didn't make any sense. Besides, the handprint was much larger than her own. She complained to her landlord, but he had no answers. Then it happened again! Connie woke one morning and discovered an oily handprint right on her own hand. A further investigation revealed fresh oil spots around her bed, and also around the dining room table. It was clear she had an intruder, but who? 

CASE THREE: A DEMON NAMED BART. Three young sisters and their friend decided that they were going to contact deceased celebrities using a Ouija board. They had done this several times before, but this time something different happened. The board began to spell out threatening messages. The girls asked the board who was communicating, and all it would say was that the spirit was in the house. And then they asked the spirit its name. The spirit spelled out the name Bart and said he was a demon. Frightened, the girls fled the house and decided to burn the Ouija board. But when one of them returned inside to get some matches, she was confronted with a sight that sent icy chills down her spine. It was a dark demonic spirit. And it wasn't going away anytime soon.

These three cases reveal the complexity of ghostly encounters and show how many different ways they are able to manifest. Ghost encounters can produce the entire range of emotions. As these cases show, some can be puzzling, some can be comforting, and some can be absolutely terrifying.

ETs are healing people all across the world. With more than 300 documented cases, it is clear that healing is a regular facet of a UFO encounter. Most major researchers have multiple cases involving cures. These cases not only provide good hard evidence of extraterrestrials, but they also show a benevolent side to UFO encounters. But with a fear-based media and an active UFO cover-up, these kinds of cases are not getting the attention they deserve.

This video presents ten true cases of healings of one specific type: the kidneys. These cases show how truly advanced in medicine the ETs are.

December 1965: Swedish construction worker Richard Hoglund encounters a landed UFO and human-looking occupants. After indicating that he has a problem with kidney stones, the ETs agree to cure him.

In 1965, health-food distributor Ludwig F. Pallman meets a human-looking man claiming to be an ET. Skeptical, Pallman is invited onboard a UFO in Peru. After being hospitalized for kidney disease, the ETs arrive to help.

October 25, 1974, oil-field worker Carl Higdon is out hunting elk in Rawlins, Wyoming. Upon encountering a landed UFO, he is taken onboard and healed of two conditions: tubercular scars in his lungs, and kidney stones.

July 17, 1978, Carmela is taken from her home in Cayey, Puerto Rico into an ET craft. She sees different types of ETs, who issue dire warnings about the future of Earth, and then heal her diseased kidneys.

In August of 1980, Hector Vasquez of San Juan, Puerto Rico is suffering from a bad case of kidney stones. Luckily, his friend is a UFO contactee. And on the way to the hospital, the ETs arrive on a healing mission.

In early 1985, Veronica of Ontario, Canada finds herself being escorted onto a UFO which had landed in her alley. Doctors had diagnosed her with kidney disease and told her she needed surgery. Then the aliens arrived!

In the summer of 1985, an anonymous woman from British Columbia, Canada meditates to relieve her severe kidney pain. Without warning, she finds herself onboard a UFO with tall humanoids, and they want to help.

April 2, 1991, a peasant in Tenjo, Colombia is riding his donkey to work when a craft lands nearby. Next thing he knows, he's being pulled onboard and taken to a large mothership where he is cured of kidney stones.

January 26, 1997, abductee Andrew from Texas finds a gray alien in his bedroom. After an exam, the gray asks him if the strange object in his kidneys is supposed to be there? No, he says. The grays agree to help.

In July 2006, Ms. E.A. Sabean is diagnosed with chronic renal failure. She prays for a healing and finds herself surrounded by short, brown-skinned ETs who heal her. Later, the ETs warn her, stop drinking diet coke!

These ten cases, most of which are verified by doctors, show that ETs do have an agenda to heal people. These healing cases reach back nearly a hundred years and come from all over the world. The cures cover the gamut of injuries, illnesses, conditions and diseases. The kidney cures presented here are likely just the tip of the iceberg. The evidence can no longer be denied. ETs are healing people. And with hundreds of more cases like these, it's likely far more common than most people realize.

While UFO sightings are undeniably interesting, even more fascinating are accounts of actual contact. Missing time, face-to-face contact with ETs, onboard encounters -- these kinds of cases provide deep insights into what it's like to have an extraterrestrial experience. 

This video presents five extraordinary cases of UFO contact. Each case is different and shows just how truly strange, bizarre and enlightening it can be to have a close-up encounter with beings from other worlds.

<h4>CASE ONE: I DID NOT EXIST FOR A DAY</h4>
In the summer of 1973, a wall street executive flew by 747 from Hawaii to his home in New York City. During the flight, he was shocked to see a metallic saucer outside the window, pacing the jet. At first, he thought it was just a simple sighting. It wasn't until he got home and received a huge shock that he realized his encounter was far more than just a sighting.

<h4>CASE TWO: THE ABDUCTION OF TOM MURILLO</h4>
One evening in 1976, New Mexico resident Tom Murillo took a drive to cool off after a family quarrel. Parking alongside a remote country road, he was approached by a strange tall figure. Moments later, he found himself being levitated inside a tube of light into a UFO craft. Inside, he was undressed, placed on a table and examined by gray ETs. But it's what they did next that left him stunned. And after being placed back in his car, Tom realized that he had just undergone the most profound and unusual experience of his life.

<h4>CASE THREE: MISSING TIME IN MOUNDHOUSE</h4>
One night in April of 1996, Paul (pseudonym), was driving to his home in Dayton, Nevada. Just after passing through the small desert town of Moundhouse, he saw a brilliant light ahead of him. Very quickly the light grew in size and landed alongside the highway, revealing itself to be an enormous saucer-shaped craft. Two tiers of windows lined the circumference. Looking through the windows, Paul saw more than a dozen strange figures looking down at him. Some were grays, but some were much stranger beings. And then they began to communicate with him, initiating an encounter that would alter the path of his life forever.

<h4>CASE FOUR: CONTACT IN TONOPAH</h4>
On the evening of July 21, 2009, four friends (James, Henry, Heather and Jamie) decided to go UFO hunting in the deserts outside of Tonopah, Arizona. They had heard of recent sightings in the area and were hoping to have one themselves. Little did they realize that they were about to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. Without warning, a gigantic triangular-shaped craft hovered overhead and then landed in front of them. A panel opened, and out stepped two strange humanoids, a short gray alien and an eight-foot-tall being. The two ETs began to communicate telepathically with the witnesses, giving them a dire warning to share with all humanity. James was able to videotape the entire encounter. After the craft departed however, the military showed up and surrounded their vehicle. Their lives, they knew, would never be the same.

<h4>CASE FIVE: IS GRANDPA AN ALIEN?</h4>
In 1955, five-year-old Marty Minetto was spending time with his grandparents in their 
home outside of Ault, Colorado. On April 9, Marty's grandfather approached him and 
asked him if he'd like to go for a walk and have a great adventure. Marty agreed. The 
next morning, Marty and his grandfather left the farmhouse and walked out into the 
remote fields by their home. To Marty's amazement, a large glowing egg-shaped craft 
dropped from the sky and landed in front of them. Moments later, a human-looking man 
stepped out and invited them both onboard. Marty's grandfather explained that it was 
time for Marty to learn about who his grandfather really was. So began an incredible 
onboard encounter during which Marty was given a tour of the craft and learned many 
secrets about the people inside it. It was the first of several other encounters that 
finally answered some of the strange mysteries surrounding his unusual grandfather.

These five true cases of UFO contact are just a few of the many accounts that are 
occurring all across our planet. We are not alone in this universe. We have never 
been alone.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC,) California has more UFO 
sightings than any other state in the United States. So it should come as no surprise 
that there are many cases involving UFO photographs. In fact, there are hundreds of 
incidents in which witnesses have been able to capture images of unidentified flying 
objects.

This video presents more than fifty cases of some of the best UFO photographs taken in the 
state of California. Many of these are multiple-witness cases with photographs that have 
been authenticated by UFO researchers and photographic experts. Some are well-known, while 
others have received almost no publicity. The majority of these photographs show solid 
metallic objects hovering in the sky. In some of these cases, it appears that the UFOs 
want to be seen, and are posing for the witnesses.

It has often been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. When it comes to UFOs, 
this is especially true. These amazing photographs provide hard evidence for the reality 
of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. We are not alone! And these photographs 
prove it!

With so many cases, the state of California has had a profound effect on our understanding 
and knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. If you would like to learn more about UFO activity in 
California, check out my book, "UFOs over California: A True History of Extraterrestrial 
Encounters in the Golden State." Now available!

It was a Sunday evening in 1966 in Cicero, Illinois. Thirteen-year-old Laura Caigoy and 
her best friend Ruthie's went outside and waited in the family station wagon, talking and 
laughing. Laura's mother was coming to pick her up and take Laura to her home.

Suddenly, Laura heard and felt a low thrumming noise. "Do you hear that?" she asked Ruthie. 
But Ruthie didn't answer. Laura looked around for the source of the noise, but saw nothing 
unusual. "Do you hear that?" she asked again. Still, Ruthie didn't respond.

The sound grew louder, so Laura jumped out of the car and scanned the street. Nothing 
seemed out of the ordinary, except for the weird thrumming noise. Then, looking up, Laura 
could hardly believe her eyes. A huge saucer-shaped craft floated just above the 
streetlights only a block away, and it was moving towards them.

The craft was large enough to span the entire width of the street. It was a perfect saucer 
with a little dome on top. A row of windows surrounded the perimeter. The interior of the 
craft was lit with a brilliant yellow light. It moved leisurely forward at only a few 
miles per hour.

Laura screamed Ruthie's name and banged on the car, but Ruthie said nothing. Laura was 
shocked to see that Cermak Road, which was normally busy with traffic, was now completely 
empty of cars. 

The craft approached until it was directly overhead. Laura felt no fear, only amazement 
and awe. Looking down, she saw three people standing nearby, two older women, who seemed 
not to notice the craft, and another lady staring at her.

The woman looked strange. Dressed in dark clothes, she was short, had strangely smooth 
skin, black shiny hair that looked almost painted on, and was wearing dark wrap-around 
sunglasses, at night!

"Look!" Laura said, pointing up. "Isn't this amazing?"

The strange woman looked casually up at the craft and then continued staring at Laura, 
almost as if studying he. She seemed to be more interested in Laura than the UFO itself!

The craft was low enough that Laura could've hit it with a rock. It slowly moved off, 
continuing down the street. Laura followed it down the street for another block, until 
the road turned into a T-intersection. The craft kept going over the housetops, 
disappearing into the distance. 

Thrilled by the encounter, Laura rushed back to the car and said softly, "Ruthie?" 
Her friend instantly bolted upright. Laura told her about the UFO, and Ruthie was 
shocked. She had passed out. She didn't see anything.

Years passed. Laura grew up, moved to California, fell in love with a man, got married 
and had a baby. Twenty-five years later, her son (now five or six years old) began to 
suffer from unexplained nosebleeds. And so did Laura.

At the same time, her son experienced severe nightmares in which he said strange tan 
creatures with huge dark eyes would come into his bedroom. One of them was a creature 
he called the "bony crab monster" a skeletal spidery-looking being with weird crab-like 
hands. Her son said that the creatures would levitate him out of the room and into the 
backyard.

Laura assumed her son was having vivid nightmares. Then, one evening, the bony crab 
monster came back and told her son, "Don't be afraid," and cut his finger. The next 
morning, her son related the 'dream' and showed Laura the cut on his finger.

Laura was shocked. Could her son's dreams be real? But how was that possible? Weeks 
later, Laura's husband came home with shocking news. He had seen a UFO -- a large, 
glowing triangular object.

Not long after that, Laura had her own sighting of a huge cylindrical-shaped craft, 
lit up at both ends. To her amazement, it was being chased by a police helicopter.

She thought of her own childhood sighting. Her son's nightmares also came to mind. 
Could all of this be related? She decided to look into the subject of UFOs and 
received an incredible shock. All the strange details seemed to come together. The 
way Ruthie fell asleep. The strange appearance of the woman with the dark wraparound 
sunglasses. The unexplained nosebleeds. Her son's nightmares of weird creatures with 
huge dark eyes." His description of being levitated out of the house. The cut on his 
finger. Could this all be because of UFOs and aliens?

Searching her past for clues, Laura now recalled a strange event at age five which back 
then had made no sense. It was something so bizarre, so unbelievable, she was never able 
to understand what happened. Now suddenly, it began to make sense.

Laura's story is one of the more unusual cases of its kind, and it provides some 
interesting and unique insights about what it's like to have extraterrestrial contact.

In May of 2022, after decades of remaining silent, Dolly Safran went public with her experiences as a lifelong fully conscious UFO contactee. As a very young child, Dolly had several encounters involving missing time. Then, in 1973, at age 14, she was taken onboard a craft from her home in the Florida Everglades, and was able to remember the entire event without the aid of hypnosis. Since then, she has had more than a thousand fully conscious onboard UFO encounters. She has been taken onboard large motherships, seen a wide variety of extraterrestrials, traveled throughout the solar system and even to other planets. Her story is one of the most extensive cases of UFO contact on record.

For many years, Dolly had tried to obtain photographs and films of the UFOs, but like most contactees, she discovered it was no easy task. In fact, it's very rare that contactees are able to obtain good photographic evidence. But when Dolly decided to go public with her experiences, she asked the ETs if they would allow themselves to be filmed. To her delight, the ETs agreed!

In Part One of this series, Dolly described her UFO encounters up to age fourteen. Now, in Part Two, Dolly shares the many photographs and videos she has been able to obtain of the UFO craft. This footage includes both daytime and nighttime footage, various UFO craft, with multiple witnesses in various locations. Dolly's extraordinary video captures include metallic craft posing for the camera, a mothership dropping smaller ET-drones, a craft that performs flips a 180-degree flip, a craft that hovers only a few hundred feet above a house, and more.

For those who want evidence of UFO reality, here it is! More than twenty photographs and films are presented. Dolly provides a detailed commentary for each photographic event, and explains why obtaining good photographic evidence is not as easy as one might think.

The photographic evidence presented here is only a portion of the many photos and films she has been able to obtain. You can view more of Dolly's amazing captures on her YouTube Channel, "DOLLYSAFRAN." The link to her channel is provided at the bottom of this description on YouTube.

According to several polls, the majority of people (at least in the USA) believe in the reality of UFOs. Yet, the UFOs themselves remain somewhat evasive. In other words, you can't just go outside and see a UFO anytime you want. And yet, sometimes you can!

There is a type of UFO behavior that investigators call "displays." In these cases, UFOs will brazenly appear over witnesses and put on a show, darting around and dancing across the sky as though they want to be seen. This type of activity is clearly a publicity campaign, involving what appears to be an agenda to announce their presence and convince people that UFOs are real, and we are not alone.

This video presents seven cases that fit this unique category of UFOs that have overcome their typical shyness and instead are showing off. These types of events have been occurring for decades and are still going on today.

1945: Mount Baden-Powell, California. Joe Stein and twenty other young boy-scouts are camping in the forest when a multi-colored object shows up and remains in the sky for most of the night.

1954: The Blue Ridge Parkway, Virginia. Bob X. is in the backseat of his parents' car traveling along the highway when an enormous shiny silver disc shows up and begins pacing their car.

1970s: Encino, California. Ronny Baron has experienced several UFO sightings throughout his life, but after moving to California he experienced three spectacular displays. One occurred over his home and was also witnessed by his son. A second occurred at a daytime party and was witnessed by twenty people. And a third occurred in the central valley in California.

1972: Costa Mesa, California. Traffic stops in the streets, people rush out of their homes and offices, and thousands of people stare upwards to see a humongous, perfectly oval, cloud-like object filled with soft pastel, multi-colored lights scoot across the sky.

1978: Palm Springs, California. Chris S., her brother and friend are camping outside when three star-like objects (red, yellow and green) start cavorting and dancing around in the sky, putting on a spectacular display.

1983: Lake Naciemento, California. Robert X and six friends observe multiple clusters of lights darting around the night sky for all night long. As they drive around, they see many other people pulling off the road to observe the dramatic display.

1990: Pasadena, California. Arni Whyler receives a telepathic message to look outside his window. A UFO instantly appears and performs an incredible maneuver. Shortly later a mysterious beam of light sweeps over his house, followed by an eerie silence and other weird effects. He also experienced another display as a young boy in Cleveland, Ohio.

These seven cases illustrate how the UFO occupants sometimes have no fear of being seen and are in fact announcing their presence. The question is why? Could it be that this is preparation for a future open official contact with all of humanity? Time will tell!

Each UFO encounter provides another piece of the puzzle and offers new insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. This video presents five new and original cases, each of which occurred within a small radius of each other. Each case in this UFO contact cluster contains strange and profound elements which illustrate certain aspects of UFO behavior.

--December 1968, Paul Allione steps outside his home in Palos Verdes, California and observes an unusual string of lights hovering at low elevation over the Santa Catalina Channel. He grabs his walkie-talkie and attempts to make contact. To his amazement, he overhears a ship's communication talking about the sighting as it is occurring. He soon learns that he is not the only witness to this sighting, and in fact, hundreds of people are seeing the same thing.

--April 1975, George Gray is driving west on the Santa Monica Freeway when he sees a strange, illuminated object sending down colorful beams of light. When the object darts across the sky, he realizes he's witnessing an actual UFO. He immediately attempts to telepathically communicate with the object, sending it messages of love. To his amazement, the object seems to respond and comes zooming towards him. George pulls over along the Pacific Coast Highway and a has a close-up encounter that he will never forget.

--Summer, 1980, Donald and Bonnie X. and their children (and neighbors) all view an unidentified red, glowing object silently hovering over their home in Santa Monica. They view the object through binoculars and are amazed to see that this object is semi-circular in shape, and stationary in the sky. Even with binoculars, they are unable to identify it. It's something they've never seen before or since. And then, two days later, they receive incredible confirmation of their sighting from a source very close to home.

---Summer, 1980, private pilot Toshi Inouye is flying at 2000 feet elevation over the Santa Monica Bay, providing flight instruction to a young student. Shortly after contacting the local airport tower and receiving clearance to land, Toshi and his student view a large, shiny, cigar-shaped light hovering near their plane. Stunned, and unable to identify the weird object, Toshi grabs the radio to question the Santa Monica Airport control tower regarding the object. If there was air traffic this close to him, they should already have informed him. But they haven't! And does he really want to report a UFO? Then, two weeks after the sighting, Toshi's student has a shocking revelation, showing that their sighting was just the beginning of deeper levels of UFO contact.

--August 4, 2006, retired attorney David Russo decides to take a light night walk to the beach only a few blocks from his home in Long Beach, California. David has often taken late night walks on the beach, however tonight, he is shocked to see a strange triangular craft studded with lights zooming towards him. As it approaches, the craft drops down from the sky, hovering only twenty feet over the water a short distance offshore. It performs incredible maneuvers, as if showing off. David is entranced, and time seems to stop. The sighting affects him profoundly, sending him on a journey of self-discovery that will leave him forever changed.

These five encounters represent a UFO contact cluster, all occurring in virtually the same location, and each of them providing important answers to the many questions surrounding the UFO phenomenon.

It's not just Roswell!

There are many kinds of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face contact, onboard UFO encounters and more. But perhaps the ultimate type of UFO encounter is a UFO crash-retrieval incident. In these incredible cases, extraterrestrial craft and ET bodies are allegedly retrieved by military forces and secreted away in various military bases across the United States and the world.

The 1947 UFO crash at Roswell, NM is the most famous case of this kind, but it's not the only one. In fact, researchers have documented hundreds of similar events from all over the planet. UFO crash retrievals are far more common than most people think. The state of New Mexico alone has more than a dozen such cases.

This video presents ten cases of UFO crash retrievals in the state of New Mexico that you may not have heard of before. Moving beyond Roswell, Aztec, Corona or the Plains of St. Augustine (all of which are fairly well-known within the UFO community) -- we move to other lesser-known cases including:

--the 1945 UFO crash at San Antonio witnessed by two boys working at an isolated ranch.
--an incident involving the shooting-down a UFO at White Sands only days before the Roswell UFO crash.
--a UFO crash in San Miguel County in 1952 as witnessed by a young couple vacationing in the area.
--a crash in the deserts of New Mexico in 1953, coming from an anonymous Radar Specialist who claims to have seen footage of the crash and bodies.
--a UFO crash at White Sands in 1953 involving a craft that was recovered almost completely intact.
--a UFO crash in 1954 outside Walker AFB in which an officer (K.A.) was on a search and rescue mission and came upon a craft and ET bodies.
--a UFO crash in 1957 as reported by three military officers who investigated rumors of a downed aircraft and found more than they bargained for.
--a UFO crash in 1962 near Holloman AFB involving a 68-foot metallic disc piloted by two extraterrestrials.
--a UFO crash in 1963 along the highway near the small town of Santa Rosa, as witnessed by an X-ray technician who view the craft and bodies.
--a UFO crash in 1974 in the Manzano Mountains near the small town of Chili, as reported to APRO by an officer at Kirtland AFB.

It was only because of sheer luck and the courage of various whistle-blowers that these ten cases were reported to various UFO researchers. Likely these cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, meaning that there are probably dozens of other cases or more that the public does not know about in the state of New Mexico alone!

During the recent Congressional UFO Hearings in May of 2022, the U.S. government stated their desire to be truthful and transparent on the subject of UFOs and UAPS, and their desire to remove the stigma surrounding the subject of extraterrestrials. And yet, when asked if the U.S. military has ever shot at a craft, or if the military is in possession of any materials from a craft, they said, "no," and said that the stories of Roswell were mere rumors! Does this sound like truth and transparency?

No more cover-ups! No more lies! The time for truth is now! The subject of UFO crash retrievals can no longer be ignored or denied. The cases are numerous and come from many highly credible witnesses. UFO crash retrievals represent the cutting edge of UFO research and have the potential to prove the reality of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet to all of humanity.

Late one evening in January of 1973, fourteen-year-old Dolly Safran (who lived near the Everglades in Florida) looked outside her window to observe more than fifty star-like objects swarming overhead. As they began to dart off in different directions, one of these objects dropped down and hovered at treetop level behind her house.

The object now revealed itself to be a solid metallic craft, with portholes. And through the portholes, Dolly was shocked to see two short, gray-skinned figures with large dark eyes and huge black heads. Aliens, she realized, and they were looking right at her! She turned to dive under her bed. At that moment, her room exploded in brilliant blue light.

The next thing Dolly knew, hours had passed and morning had arrived. Dolly found herself on the floor of her room, dressed in someone else's pajamas, which were on inside out and backwards. She had been taken, she realized. It had happened again.

Throughout her young life, this sort of thing had happened several times. But this time, she resolved to remember. And when the radio came on and said that there had been other witnesses, Dolly got the confirmation she needed. She wasn't crazy. She really was seeing UFOs. 

She sat down in the bathroom and began to concentrate, meditate, focus. And all at once, the wall of amnesia started to crumble and memories of being taken onboard the craft flooded into her mind. 

Dolly had to go to school that day, and she received further confirmation when her best friend also reported seeing a UFO on the same night. By the end of the day, Dolly remembered everything that had happened to her that night. And not only did she remember that night, she was able to recall the many other times she had been taken, going all the way back to her first contact event when she was only ten months old and she floated right out of her crib.

Suddenly, all those weird events of missing time made sense. Dolly recalled many other instances of contact. She recalled the time at age two where he was missing for two hours and was found six miles away from her home. She had been taken.

She remembered an incident at age six when a craft came down and took her from the front yard of her home. She recalled many other instances too.

But her experience at age fourteen changed everything. She recalled being taken onboard the craft and meeting short little grays, and a much taller gray she called "Momma." She was given a tour of the craft. The craft itself was a living being, and Dolly recalled meeting him many times. She called him "Tlera." 

During this onboard experience, Dolly was taken to the control room, which the ETs called "the place of movement." She was instructed to sit in the pilot seat and to her amazement and delight, the craft left Earth and they traveled to Saturn. After exploring Saturn's rings and many moons, they traveled to Earth's moon, actually landing upon its surface.

Dolly had a long conversation with the ETs, and they offered her the opportunity to learn from them and work alongside them. She was given the freedom to choose any subject she wanted to explore. "Can I learn how to fly the craft?" Dolly asked. 

The ETs agreed. And so began Dolly's lifelong experiences as a fully conscious UFO contactee. She soon began having fantastic adventures including visiting large motherships filled with plants and animals, traveling to other planets and star-systems and meeting with a wide variety of ETs. It was a fantastic adventure that is still going on to this day.

This video presents Dolly's story up to age fourteen, including many of her childhood experiences, and her incredible awakening at age fourteen where she was taken onboard the craft and then traveled across the solar system, starting a lifetime of fully conscious contact.

Dolly's story of extraterrestrial contact is one of the most extensive and profound cases on record. If you would like to explore more about her many UFO encounters, you can read about them in my new book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure." Now available!

Located west of Los Angeles, California, nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains, the small community of Topanga Canyon has long been known as a UFO hotspot. In fact, on June 14, 1992, numerous people called the local police station and newspaper office reporting UFOs. And for the next two years, a wave of encounters inundated the area. Sightings, landings, UFO-car chases, bedroom visitations, abductions and more occurred at an unprecedented rate. This became known as the Topanga Canyon UFO wave.

But this wave was not an isolated event. Encounters occurred before this wave, and they continued to occur after it. This video presents a selection of ten of some of the more interesting and unique UFO encounters in this very active area. They show how strange and unusual the UFO phenomenon can be, and provide some profound insights into how UFOs behave and interact with people on Earth.

For example, there is the case of Ethan Holtzman, who was experiencing a powerful feeling of deja-vu when suddenly a blazing red UFO dropped down from the sky over his vehicle.

Or the case of Dr. David Philips (a college professor) who was woken up in the early hours of the morning to hear helicopters hovering over the canyon, sending down searchlights as if looking for something. A few minutes later, he saw what they were apparently looking for: a shiny silver disc evading the helicopters and scooting south down the canyon.

Or the case of Bruce Merrifield and Reyna Massey, who while driving through the canyon, were confronted by an enormous metallic craft studded with colored lights hovering a mere twenty feet over the nearby ridge. As soon as they saw it, the craft turned up on its side and flashed its lights at them.

Or the case of Samantha, who was driving near her home adjacent to Topanga State Park when she saw a mysterious red orb zipping across the sky, appearing and disappearing, turning at right angles, and drawing weird geometric shapes in the sky. Afterwards, Samantha began to have memories of being taken onboard a UFO.

Or the case of Taylor, who had just moved into the canyon, and began to see fleets of UFOs and even a mother ship. The UFOs appeared so many times and came so close, that Taylor ended up moving out of the canyon a short time later.

Or the case of Valerie Dennett, who looked out her window to see an exceptionally bright star in the sky. She made a wish upon the star when suddenly it blinked out, and in its place was an object with blue and red lights. Looking outside, Valerie saw two other identical objects hovering in the sky. Feeling like the object was watching her, and feeling concern for her newborn baby, Valerie tried to wake up her boyfriend. But her boyfriend could not be awakened.

These are just a few of the many unusual extraterrestrial encounters which have occurred (and continue to occur) in Topanga Canyon. It's one of California's most active hotspots, producing virtually the entire range of UFO encounters. If you want to see a UFO, this is the place to be.

If you would like to explore more about these encounters and many others, check out my book, "UFOs over Topanga Canyon." Now available.

There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face contact, onboard UFO encounters, crash/retrievals and more. UFO skeptics often say that these cases rely solely on eyewitness testimony with no supporting hard physical evidence. But this is simply not true.

Most sightings have multiple eyewitness testimony. Some are supported by lie-detector tests, radar-returns, photographs and films. Many encounters display a wide variety of evidence such as electromagnetic effects, animal reactions, physiological effects (injuries and healings,) angel hair, implants (which appear on x-rays and MRIs, and have in some cases been removed and subjected to scientific study) and more. There is a lot more evidence for UFOs than most people realize.

One of the most compelling types of evidence is known as UFO landing traces. Close Encounters of the Second Kind are those cases which affect the physical environment in some way. The ultimate example of this are the UFO landing traces cases. 

There are thousands of reports of UFO landings. And there are hundreds upon hundreds of these which involve hard physical evidence in the form of landing traces. 

Landing traces come in many different forms including crushed vegetation, swirled grass, accelerated growth of vegetation, gouges in the earth, compacted soil, burn marks, soil that shows evidence of having been exposed to a high heat source, radiation readings, and more.

This video presents a chronology of more than thirty UFO landing trace cases. They come from all across our planet, reach back many decades in time, and are still occurring today.

Some of these cases are very well known, such as the Socorro, NM UFO landing in 1964; the Tully, Australia UFO landing in 1966; the Delphos, Kansas UFO landing in 1971; the Langenburg, Canada UFO landing in 1974; the Trans-En-Provence, France UFO landing in 1981; and the Voronezh, Russia UFO landing in 1989, to name a few! However, the vast majority of UFO landing trace cases have received almost no publicity whatsoever.

This video presents these well-known cases, and many which are not well-known. All of these cases provide hard physical evidence of UFOs. Many of the landing traces have been studied in scientific labs. 

The cases presented here are only a small portion of the actual number of cases. The time for skepticism is over. These landing trace cases provide conclusive proof that we are being visited by UFOs and extraterrestrials. To ignore them would be wholly unscientific. 

Where are these cases taking place? What actually happens when a UFO lands on our planet? What do these cases have to say about the nature and origin of the UFO phenomenon? The answers are here!

UFOs are not only seen in the skies above us. They are also seen in our oceans. Researchers call them, "USOs" or unidentified submersible objects. And there are a lot of them!

USOs are seen all over the world, but one of the most active areas on our planet is off the coast of Southern California, specifically, the Santa Catalina and San Pedro Channel. This body of water has produced more than 150 documented cases of UFOs and USOs. With an average depth of about 3000 feet, and some areas one mile deep, there are plenty of places for USOs to hide.

Objects have been seen diving into the water, and flying out, sometimes both! One of the most interesting types of USO encounters are cases in which these craft have targeted boaters. There are nearly a dozen cases on record in which UFOs hover directly over boaters, or even more incredibly, precisely beneath them. Cases have been occurring for decades and are still happening today.

On July 10, 1955, the Washington family was in their boat thirteen miles off the coast of Newport Beach when a UFO appeared right over their boat and began to follow them. They called the Coast Guard who agreed to send out a plane to investigate. No sooner had they hung up the radio when the UFO darted away.

In July of 1987, a group of people were making a night-crossing from Catalina Island to Rancho Palos Verdes, when a UFO approached and again, stopped over their boat. With a very unusual appearance and making no sound, it was clearly not a conventional aircraft. 

On January 3, 2004, a gentleman by the name of Young Chyren was shocked to see a UFO hovering right over a sailboat only a short distance off the shore of Santa Monica. When the object remained in place, he quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a photograph, which clearly shows a metallic disc-shaped object, providing more evidence that UFOs are targeting boaters.

Even more compelling are those cases in which UFOs (or rather, USOs!) approach boats from underwater. A dramatic case occurred in the late 1980s to an anonymous electronics engineer who was sailing his fully equipped yacht to Santa Cruz Island when a massive, round, glowing, green craft targeted his boat and moved directly underneath it, causing his compasses, depth-sounders and electrical equipment to all fail at once.

Or consider the case of a gentleman who was sailing along the coast of Catalina Island at night when a gigantic square of glowing white light appeared under his boat, illuminating the water for hundreds of feet around him.

Or the case of a gentleman who was in the Channel Islands area when he saw what he first thought might be whales swimming under his boat. Then one approached closely and he saw that it wasn't a whale; instead it was a round, silvery metallic, saucer-shaped object. 

These are just a few of the many cases in which USOs are targeting boaters in the Santa Catalina channel. This video presents a chronology of these very interesting encounters, including one case in which a boat was actually sunk by a USO!

Why are UFOs targeting boaters? Are they curious? Are they trying to announce their presence? Where are these objects coming from? How many are there? What is the motive behind this very unusual aspect of UFO behavior? 

This video presents the best cases of boaters that have been targeted by USOs, and answers many of the questions surrounding these types of accounts.

In the late 1940s, young teenager, Dudley Delany was listening to the popular radio host Frank Edwards talk about UFOs being seen in the skies across the world. Dudley was amazed and entranced. Extraterrestrials were visiting our world? The idea seemed fantastic, and yet there were so many reports. So began Dudley's lifelong fascination with the subject.

Dudley now believed in UFOs, but he certainly didn't think he was personally involved. He grew up and became very interested in medicine. He went to school and became first a registered nurse, then a licensed chiropractor, and also a licensed massage therapist. So began Dr. Delany's lifelong mission to help and heal humanity.

Then one morning, he woke to a puzzling mystery. There was a strange lump on his cheek. It hadn't been there the day before. How had it appeared so quickly, seemingly overnight? The strange mystery concerned him, and one day he decided to take action. Thinking it was perhaps a boil, he sterilized a needle and started to pierce and drain the boil. To his shock, out popped a tiny crystal-like object! Dudley was confused. How could a crystal be lodged inside his body? It made no sense. But with no explanation, he forgot about it.

Years passed. Then in 1991, Dudley (now in his fifties) started to feel unwell. He went to the doctor and received a devastating diagnosis: he was suffering from multiple sclerosis. Always interested in alternative healing, Dudley began researching ways to heal himself and came upon the work of the world-famous psychic, Edgar Cayce, who was known for diagnosing and healing people of a wide variety of illnesses. 

Dudley found information about how to heal his own condition, and it worked! His MS went into full remission. Delighted, Dudley wrote a book about his healing experience and became a strong proponent of alternative healing.

Then, one evening in 1998, not long after he had retired, Dudley had his first unambiguously UFO-related encounter. He woke up to see a beam of light coming through the roof and ceiling of his home, striking his body where he lay in bed. What, he wondered, was that? A beam of light from a UFO?

A few years later, in early 2001, Dudley had another strange experience. He woke one evening to sense a presence in his room. He felt and heard something or someone sit on the bed next to him. Then he felt a strange hand grasping his own. Alarmed, he quickly opened his eyes and turned around. But the room was empty. Again he wondered, what was that? A ghost? An alien? He wasn't sure.

But he began to research the subject, and asking other members of his family, he was shocked when his niece revealed that she herself had been taken onboard a UFO at age ten, where she met both grays and human-looking ETs. This provided Dudley with some confirmation of his own experiences. 

In July of 2001, Dudley traveled to Virginia Beach to attend a conference at the Edgar Cayce Foundation. He had a wonderful time meeting with like-minded people and talking about alternative healing and UFOs. Then, one evening he went to bed and had the single most profound UFO encounter of his entire life. At the time he had been experiencing prostate problems which were causing him pain and difficulties with urination. That evening, he woke up to find that he was no longer in his room. Instead, he was apparently onboard an ET craft, lying upon a table.

Unable to move or speak, he watched as a short humanoid approached and began to conduct a procedure, telling Dudley that he had a tumor, and that he was there to be healed. Dudley felt no fear, and was in fact, amazed and delighted to receive a healing at the hands of ETs. Following the procedure, his prostate problems disappeared.

Dudley now examined his past in a new light. Suddenly all those weird events began to make sense. The weird crystal in his cheek. Could that have been an alien implant? The beam of light that came through the ceiling, the strange nighttime visitor in his bedroom -- perhaps he had been having more contact than he realized. Then he remembered a weird event which occurred when he was a young teenager, something so strange and personal that he had never told anyone, or even though about. But now, with the benefit of hindsight, it suddenly made sense. And he wondered if it was possible that his contact with ETs had started much earlier than he had ever imagined. And perhaps he had hybrid alien-human children!

This video presents the story of Dr. Dudley Delany's lifelong alien encounters, and provides some interesting insights into the UFO contact experience.

It may sound strange and unusual, but there are now several documented cases on record in which people have met ETs, been taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft and shown an alien book. It doesn't happen often, but there are more cases than you might think.

One very well-known case is Betty Hill, who was taken onboard a UFO with her husband, Barney in 1961 in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. While on the craft, Betty was given a large book, filled with alien symbols in long narrow columns.

Another famous case is Betty Andreasson, a lifelong contactee from Massachusetts, who was given a thin blue book with glowing white pages, and was actually allowed to keep it in her home and study it for a short period of time.

These cases are not unique. A fascinating case involving an alien book comes from Jeff Selver, a Canadian businessman who has recently and courageously stepped forward to reveal his encounters with ETs. During an onboard UFO encounter at age sixteen, he was handed a "mystic book" and told to study its contents. The book was filled with deeply spiritual messages that would alter the course of his life.

Researcher Richard Boylan Ph.D., reports on the case of "Mike," a contactee from northern California. While onboard a craft, Mike was shown a book with a strange alien symbol on the cover, was instructed to read it, and was told he would remember the contents later in life. The alien book ended up having a profound influence on his life.

Researcher David Jacobs Ph.D., also reports on an unusual case in which a young girl was taken onboard to meet with a human-ET hybrid. They both sat down and read an alien book together.

This video presents nearly a dozen firsthand cases of people who have been given alien books by the extraterrestrials. Several of them have never been published before and are revealed here for the first time.

Perhaps the most interesting and extensive case comes from Dolly Safran, a fully conscious contactee from Florida who has only recently stepped forward to reveal her lifelong contacts with extraterrestrials. In a live firsthand interview, Dolly reveals her experiences with a sapphire-blue ET book which she has studied for countless hours while onboard the ET craft.

What do these books look like? Why are contactees being given these books? What kind of knowledge do these alien books contain? And most importantly, how are they affecting those who have had the fantastic opportunity to read them?

This video answers all these questions and more, and provides a study and comparative analysis of these very unusual events. Told in the witnesses' own words, with witness drawings and firsthand interviews, the secret messages in these alien books are finally being revealed.

If you would like to explore more about the most extensive case of an alien book on record, check out my book, "Symmetry: A True UFO Adventure," which presents the lifelong UFO encounters of Dolly Safran. Now available!

This is the story of Julia (pseudonym) and her encounters with a gray alien named Sen. At age 19, Julia left her family and home in Prunedale, California. Her childhood had been difficult, filled with unexplained events. She had tried to get help from her parents, but they were strict and didn't understand. So Julia left everything behind and decided to get as far away from her home as she could.

She ended up settling on the east coast of the United States, where she began to rebuild her life. She found a job, a place to live. She started her own small business, made friends, and met the man who would one day become her husband. Finally secure, she began to examine her childhood, trying to figure out the source of her trauma. She remembered terrifying events during which her room would fill with light and shadowy figures would approach her. She came upon the subject of aliens and UFOs. That's probably what happened she realized. It was aliens. But the whole idea terrified her and she refused to think about it.

A few years later, Julia felt a powerful compulsion to move back to California. Although her life was going great, she and her boyfriend picked up everything and moved to Pacific Grove, not far from her childhood home. The very day they finished moving in, strange things began to happen. 

It started with a weird ringing sound in her right ear. She went to the doctor, but he couldn't explain it. There were no insects in her ear canal as she feared. It wasn't tinnitus. The doctor had no diagnosis.

Then came the UFO sightings, weird glowing orbs hovering over the house. Then one evening, there was a ship overhead. Julia saw it through the skylight above her bed. Next thing she knew, she was paralyzed. A short time later, she fell asleep.

In the morning, she told her boyfriend. She could no longer live in denial. The memories of her childhood experiences were flooding back. The excruciating tones in her right ear were becoming unbearable. UFOs were hovering over their house. She finally found the reason for her problems. It was aliens. They had visited her since she was a girl. Now they were back, And she believed the source of the tones in her ear was probably an alien implant.

Her husband was shocked, but he was also very supportive. He believed her, but had no idea how to help her. Deeply in love, they got married.

Julia examined her childhood. She remembered seeing colorful orbs as a little girl. She recalled the hundreds of times her bedroom would fill with light and scary shadowy figures would materialize around her. She remembered a dramatic UFO sighting at age ten of a giant flying saucer. Julia could no longer deny that she was having contact with extraterrestrials.

Then one evening, she woke up to hear a weird musical sound reverberating through the house. She wandered around, trying to locate the source. Then she realized, it was inside her head! Next thing she knew, Julia found herself being pulled onboard a craft. She saw that she was laying on a table in a small, round room, surrounded by short, thin, gray-skinned beings with large bald heads and big dark eyes. 

They handed her a baby and asked her to hold it. It looked just like a gray alien. Julia was shocked. And looking outside the craft, she saw the darkness of space, and far below her, the planet Earth.

Next thing she knew, it was morning, and she was back in bed. Looking at her stomach, she saw three bleeding puncture wounds. Both Julia and her husband were shocked and traumatized. And they became even more shocked when they discovered that Julia was pregnant.

From this point, events escalated. Julia kept waking up to find herself unable to move. One evening, her husband woke up to see a gray alien entering their bedroom. Shortly later, Julia had a miscarriage. She was secretly relieved. The pregnancy had not felt normal, and she was certain that it had something to do with the night she was taken onboard a craft.

At that point, her experiences ended. Or so she thought. They fled California, and moved to the east coast. They had a baby boy, and became pregnant with their second child. Then, one morning, Julia decided to reach out mentally to contact the gray alien baby she had held in her arms years ago. To her shock, she made instant contact. In her mind, she saw a gray. He introduced himself and said his name was Sen and that he was made up of her DNA. Then began an hours-long conversation in which Julia learned all the answers about everything that had happened to her throughout her life.

This video tells the story of Julia's encounters, and what she learned from Sen about her own encounters and the alien agenda on our planet. If you'd like to explore more, Julia's story is presented in my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters." Now available!

It is sometimes human nature to shoot first and ask questions later. This concept is perfectly illustrated with UFO encounters. In fact, there are dozens of cases on record involving shoot-outs between humans and UFOs and aliens. 

This video presents nearly two dozen cases in which people have shot at UFOs and extraterrestrials. Cases like these reach all the way back to the 1940s, the beginning of the Modern Age of UFOs, and continue up to the present day. Police officers, security guards, military personnel, hunters, ranchers and many others have all shot at UFOs. 

What happens when someone shoots at a UFO? Does it affect the UFO? Will the ETs react by defending themselves? The cases here show exactly what happens. And the results might surprise you.

On the evening of December 26, 1988, Teri Smith (a physical therapist) went to sleep with her boyfriend Brian in a bedroom in a large condominium complex located in Chatsworth, California. At some point in the middle of the night, Teri woke to a strange thrumming noise and the feeling that somebody was in the room. She found herself unable to move or speak. As she struggled against the strange force, she felt four prong-like "things" grabbing her ankle, causing pain. Terrified, she finally managed to open her eyes and was confronted by a baffling sight.

At the foot of her bed was a large glowing misty-like entity. As she sat up, this entity quickly darted out through the closed window of the bedroom. Looking outside, Teri was shocked to see a huge UFO landed in the alley behind the condominium. The strange figure entered into the landed object, which promptly took off straight up. Only then did Teri's boyfriend Brian finally wake up. He hadn't seen anything. Neither had three other adults and a child who were also in the condo. But Teri knew what she had experienced. It wasn't a dream.

The next day, the entire experience had completely left her mind. It was only while she was at her place of employment when she felt a strong pain in her ankle and a soreness in her neck that the events of the previous night flooded back into her mind.

After work, Teri called her best friend, Traci Stoor, and told her what happened. Traci was shocked. Traci hadn't told Teri,  but Tracy had been having these kinds of experiences for many years. Now it seemed that they had spread to her friend Teri. And not only that, on the same night of Teri's encounter, Traci's boyfriend, George, had also had an encounter, and it was identical to Teri's down to the tiniest detail! This remarkable turn of events was too strange to be a coincidence, and it provided Teri with confirmation that her own experience was absolutely real.

Meanwhile, attention turned to Traci, who confirmed both Teri's and George's encounters, and also had her own encounters. Traci revealed that she had experienced a face-to-face visitation with an alien entity in a location that one would never expect.

This video presents the story of a small group of friends, and how Traci's UFO encounters spread like a contagion among her two best friends. It reveals many of the standard patterns of UFO contact, and shows how encounters can happen in the least likely locations.

The full story of "The Chatsworth UFO Epidemic" is presented in my book, "One in Forty." Now available!

In January 2006, a young couple, Charles and Maria (pseudonyms) moved into their new home on the east coast of Canada. They were quite busy with moving in, repairing the house, starting a new business and dealing with red-tape from the Canadian government about insurance and other issues, when they became pregnant. While they had been hoping to start a family, they wanted to settle in first. Still, it was good news and quite exciting for them both.

They went to the doctor, verified the pregnancy and hired a midwife. They informed both their families of the happy news, and transformed one of the rooms in their home into a nursery for the baby.

The pregnancy proceeded smoothly. They visited the doctor and midwife regularly. At around three or four months, both Maria and Charles felt the baby kicking and squirming. Her belly grew larger and larger. Thankfully, she only suffered a minor case of morning sickness.

Then in July 2006, about seven months into the pregnancy, something strange happened. They were driving to their friends' house to attend a dinner party, and somehow became lost and disoriented. To their shock, they arrived at their destination far sooner than they should have. But unable to explain it, they just ignored it and moved on with their lives.

Other than the baby moving into a breech position, the pregnancy was still going fine. Their midwife prescribed exercises to help encourage the baby to move into the proper position for birth.

Then, two weeks later, on August 2, 2006 (at seven and a half months pregnancy), they went to sleep and awoke to a violent electrical storm over their house. The bolts of lightning were massive and quite unusual, traveling horizontally across their backyard. Frightened for their safety, Charles jumped up and closed the window. The next thing they knew, it was morning. That was weird; neither could understand how they fell asleep so quickly.

Both Charles and especially Maria felt a bit dazed and groggy. Maria felt almost as though she had been anesthetized. And looking down at her belly, she was shocked to see that it had shrunk in size. Not only that, she no longer felt pregnant. She told her husband, who said that perhaps the baby had moved away from a breech position. Maria hoped that was the case, but she didn't think so. She also noticed three strange puncture wounds in a triangular position on the arch of her foot.

Concerned, they went to see their midwife. To their dismay, the midwife was unable to detect the baby's heartbeat and urged them to visit their doctor immediately, which they did. 

The doctor ran some tests and then told them the devastating news: Maria was no longer pregnant. Charles and Maria were shocked and began crying. There was no explanation. She had not had any problems. There was no miscarriage. Blood tests had confirmed the pregnancy. They both had heard the heartbeat numerous times. Not only that, they felt the baby kicking. Still, the doctor told them that she was not pregnant, and that perhaps there had been a mis-diagnosis. Neither Charles nor Maria believed this to be the case.

Thus began a search for answers, but there were none. The only explanation that they could find was the "missing fetus syndrome." They learned that women who had experienced UFO encounters sometimes lost their babies under mysterious circumstances. Could this be what happened to them?

Examining their past, they found several clues. Charles had seen UFOs, and so had his father. Maria reported dreaming about "light beings" and on a few occasions had actually seen them in her bedroom. Then there was that weird incident on the way to their friends' house. The problem was, most of the cases they found occurred at three or four months. They were seven and a half months pregnant!

This video presents the story and Charles and Maria and their experience with the missing fetus syndrome. While they can't prove that aliens took their baby, neither of them can find any other explanation. It's an important case that illustrates one of the ET agendas involving human reproduction.

In 1963, the Sanz family moved into their new home in Arleta, California. The two daughters, Karen (age 6) and Susan (age 2) shared a room. One evening, Karen awoke to an incredible shock: a strange boogie-man-like figure emerged from the closet, floated across the room and went to her little sister's crib. She watched in fear as the short, big-eyed creature poked its hand through the bars of the crib. Fearing that Susan was going to be taken away, Karen tried to get up. Instead, she found herself falling asleep. That was the first visit from the muddy man. But it wasn't the last. 

Soon the muddy man returned. A week or two later, Karen woke up, and watched again as this same creature appeared and went directly to Susan's crib. It looked at Karen, but once more remained by Susan's crib. Despite trying to stay awake, Karen fell asleep. When it happened a third time a week later, Karen told her parents. "You're just having a nightmare," they told her.

But Karen knew it wasn't a nightmare. She was awake. And it kept happening. Week after week, month after month, this muddy man kept appearing, always going to Susan's crib. No matter how hard she tried, Karen could not stay awake. Unable to convince her parents, Karen had nobody to talk to about it. 

Years passed, but the visits continued, soon mounting into the hundreds. Always, the weird creature emerged from the closet area, and went directly to Susan. Even when they re-arranged the positions of the beds, it was always the same. The muddy man seemed only interested in Susan.

Unknown to Karen, Susan had also begun to see the muddy man. She was now old enough to realize that something was wrong, and that whoever or whatever this figure was, it wasn't human. It was short, bald, with a huge head and large dark, wraparound eyes. After several such visits, Susan (like Karen had) told her parents about what was happening. Again, her parents assumed it was a nightmare.

One time, Susan saw the figure appear in the closet holding a strange black box. And standing next to the figure was Susan's mother. Except it wasn't her mother. Instead, Susan was convinced it was something else, a disguise. Like Karen, Susan was never able to stay awake.

More weird events occurred. Susan would sometimes hear her name being called in her head, over and over, "Susan! Susan! Susan!" Another time, the family went to visit Zuma Beach. Susan was in the water when she became disoriented and felt like she was being dragged away. There was a strange unexplained shift, and she found herself in a different location. Looking back in hindsight, she realizes this was a classic case of missing time.

At the time, neither Karen nor Susan had ever heard of aliens or extraterrestrials. Neither of them had ever seen a UFO, so they had no idea how to interpret what was happening to them. 

Then, in 1969, after six years, the visitations abruptly ended. Things began to return back to normal. Susan, however, was left with anxiety. Certain big-eyed cartoon characters sent chills down her spine. She began dreaming about UFOs hovering over her house.

But it wasn't until 1988, when Karen and Susan (now adults) returned home for Thanksgiving that they reminisced about their childhood and began to connect to the dots. Susan told her sister that she used to have weird waking nightmares about a creature that would emerge from the closet. "The Muddy Man!" Karen said. "I saw it too!" Only then did they realize that they had been seeing the same thing. And when images of gray aliens began to appear on television, they finally had their answer about what the creature was. It was a gray alien.

Susan was shocked, and reading about UFOs, she was amazed to see how closely their experiences matched those of other people. The only thing was, they had never seen a UFO. But that was about to change. Just a few years later, Susan's five-year-old daughter reported seeing a "little boy" in her bedroom. That was when the unexplained nosebleeds began. And weird scoop marks on their bodies.

In 1991, Karen went back home to live with her parents. To her shock, the muddy man came for another visit.

One year later, in 1992, Susan woke up one morning to see a UFO landing in her backyard. Several gray aliens emerged. They were angry. Susan had agreed to go on television in a few days to talk about her encounters. The ETs made it clear, they didn't want her to go public. Susan cancelled her TV appearance.

But soon the UFOs were back, and this time Susan's husband Hector was a witness. This video presents the true story of a long and complex series of UFO contacts that changed the lives of two sisters forever. It reveals many of the patterns of UFO contact.

In 1975, the Robinson Family (pseudonym) left their home in the San Fernando Valley in southern California to spend the weekend in a cabin located in Cedar Pines, in the remote wilderness of the San Bernardino National Forest. Little did they know, this weekend vacation would mark the beginning of a series of UFO encounters that would involve their entire family. 

That evening, the mother, Diane Robinson, looked out the window of the cabin and saw a large round object covered with white lights, hovering and darting around before quickly zipping off. Meanwhile, in the lower cabin, her two young daughters (Jenny and Kelly) and their cousin, also observed the object. All the witnesses were deeply impressed that they had seen a genuine UFO. But it was just a simple sighting, and they thought that would be the end of it. But it was just the beginning.

Years later, in 1982, Kelly Robinson (now a teenager), traveled south to the small town of Julian to spend a few weeks at a church camp located in the remote Volcan Mountains. Laying outside one evening watching the stars, Kelly and her friends were amazed to see a star-like object flitting across the sky. It moved super-fast and at acute angles, making it obvious that it could not be a plane, helicopter, balloon, shooting star, satellite or any other conventional object. It was a UFO. After watching this object dance across the sky, Kelly and her friends became frightened and retreated inside. None of them talked about the sighting.

Over the next few years, Kelly returned to the same church camp in Julian, and on at least two other occasions, witnessed more UFOs. One time they watched an object for over an hour. It became an interesting and fun activity to look for UFOs, but it also made Kelly slightly nervous.

Events soon began to escalate. Back at the Robinson family home (located in Reseda, California,) Kelly's older sister, Jenny, was driving outside with her friends when they saw a strange unidentified flying object flitting around in the night sky. Again it was a star-like object, quite high in altitude, but obviously not a plane. And when Jenny saw it again, she began to wonder, why were they seeing so many UFOs?

Soon they would have their answer. In October 1987, Kelly (now age 19,) woke up in her bedroom to find herself surrounded by several gray aliens. "Do not be afraid," they said. "Come with us."

Kelly was consumed with fear, and protested, explaining that she had a family, a job and bills to pay. The next thing she knew, Kelly found herself inside a small, rounded room with gray walls, laid out on a table. Small figures with large dark eyes, bald heads and grayish skin surrounded her, and told her that they needed to cut her arm. They then told her they needed to do an operation on her brain, and that Kelly would not remember any of this.

"No," Kelly protested. "I will remember!" And she did. When she woke up the next morning, she immediately looked at her arm and saw a thin, red scar where she had been cut by the grays.

That was her first encounter, but two weeks later, the grays came back again. This began a series of encounters. During one such event, Kelly was able to converse with the ETs, and they provided her with several predictions about her personal life.

More strange events began to occur, including a series of weird poltergeist activity. 

Meanwhile, Kelly's mother, Diane, woke up to find a strange needle-like mark on her arm. And following one of Kelly's encounters, Diane had a very strange "dream," that she had been taken onboard a UFO and shown weird-looking babies. A human-looking figure entreated Diane to hold and nurture the babies, saying, "they have everything, but they need love."

This video presents the true story of the Robinson family's series of UFO encounters. What began with a simple sighting eventually escalated into a full-blown series of close encounters and onboard UFO experiences. This case reveals one of the main gray agendas to produce hybrid babies. It's a multiple witness case, and shows the patterns that often appear in many other cases of extraterrestrial contact.

This amazing case was first presented in my book, "One in Forty: The UFO Epidemic," along with many other cases of UFO contact. Now available!

If you had the opportunity to go live with the aliens, would you accept the invitation? Before you answer, consider what happened to a young man named Paul.

In 1978, a group of a half-dozen young men went to a remote cabin in the deserts of Palm Springs, California to enjoy a weekend getaway from the city. During their stay, one of the men, Paul, (age 21) decided to take a late night walk alone through the wilderness. Hours passed and back at the cabin, Paul's friends became worried. Had Paul become lost? Had he hurt himself. They were just getting ready to organize a search party and go look for him when Paul returned to the cabin with an incredible story.

Paul said that during his walk, he saw an unidentified glowing object drop from the sky and land on the desert floor near the base of a cliff. Paul went to investigate and to his amazement, he saw that the object was a flying saucer, a UFO. And walking around the object were several strange figures. 

Paul gathered up his courage and approached the object. Upon arriving at the site, Paul saw that the figures were not human. They were aliens, extraterrestrials. They were about five feet tall, bald, with large dark eyes, grayish skin, and each of them wore a white jumpsuit. They welcomed Paul and explained that they were studying this location. They invited him onboard their craft, which Paul said was all white inside, very clean and sparsely furnished. Then they asked him a question which sent Paul's mind reeling. "Would you like to come with us?" The only thing was, if he said yes, the decision would be permanent. He could not return.

This was the story that Paul told his friends. Some of Paul's friends were skeptical of the story, but others believed him. And then, soon something happened which would leave them no choice.

Paul's story is among the strangest of UFO contact stories, but it is not wholly unique. This video presents the true UFO encounter of Paul, and of two other separate cases involving different men -- all who were apparently invited to live among the ETs. It's something that happens more often than you might think.

Paul's complete story is told in my book, "Onboard UFO Encounters." Now available!

In 2012, Nancy (pseudonym), a single parent from a small town in Indiana, took her 14-year-old son, Anthony, (pseudonym) to the dentist for his annual cleaning, check-up and dental x-rays. Unknown to her, the x-rays showed the presence of a strange unknown object in her son's jaw. They went to the dentist each year, but it wasn't until three years later, in 2015, that they were scheduled for another series of x-rays. On this occasion, the dentist revealed that the x-rays indicated the presence of a metallic FB (foreign body) in her son's jaw, beneath his lower left molar. There was no evidence of any entry wound, and the tooth was healthy, pain-free, and asymptomatic. The dentists were utterly baffled and unable to explain the presence of this mysterious object.

So began Nancy and Anthony's search for answers. The problem was, there were no explanations, except for one. And the explanation was so outlandish that Nancy wasn't sure if she could accept it. Everywhere she looked, the words "alien implant" kept appearing. When Nancy questioned her son about it, he admitted that he had, in fact, had a close encounter with a UFO. He was also having dreams about aliens.

Nancy was amazed. She had always known her son was special. As a very young child, he used to see spirits. As he grew, he began to display many powerful psychic abilities, and would daily experience precognition, clairvoyance and incredible synchronicities. And now there was the UFO sighting. Could this all be connected?

It was shortly before the first x-ray was taken in 2012. Anthony and his friend were walking outside at night when a strange cluster of blue and yellow lights appeared in the sky. The lights dropped down low over their heads and began flashing bright colors. He and his friend were both convinced it was a genuine UFO.  

Nancy now found herself obsessed. She needed to know exactly what was happening with her son. Then, on the evening of May 5, 2017, Nancy had an encounter with gray aliens. She watched as one gray stood by the bedroom door, and two other grays began working Anthony. One of the grays told her telepathically that she did not need to worry about her son. "Do not be afraid," he told her. "Everything is okay. We are not here to hurt you. Everything is going to be okay." 

When morning arrived, Nancy told Anthony what happened, and that she felt a huge sense of relief. Both wondered if his apparent alien implant was still there. They were scheduled to have another set of x-rays in a few weeks, so they were eager to see. 

When they arrived at the dentist's office, he took two x-rays. The first one showed that the mysterious object was still there. But the second x-ray, taken about 30 seconds after the first one, showed that the implant had disappeared. Shocked, the dentist took a third x-ray free of charge. To everyone's amazement, the implant was back! One of the dental technicians was so upset by the mystery, she had to leave the room.

Events were still in progress. Around this time, Nancy began to have recall of her own encounters, reaching back all the way to childhood, when she discovered a mysterious "lump" in her nasal cavity. She also had vivid memories of grays visiting her throughout her life.

Then, in November of 2018, Nancy was taken onboard a UFO. To her amazement, the interior of the UFO was "dressed up" to look very much like a living room, complete with couch, chair, a TV and cheap carpet. But she was sure she was on a craft, especially after a nine-foot-tall praying mantis ET entered and began to perform a procedure on her and someone else who was also onboard the craft.

Nancy had no fear. She feels confident that the ETs mean her no harm. And both she and Anthony have accepted the fact that they are UFO contactees. Still, they prefer to keep this aspect of their lives private and have elected to remain anonymous. They just want to live their lives normally.

Today Nancy and Anthony are moving on with their lives. Anthony is still having daily psychic experiences. But they, like his implant, have become a normal part of his life.

This video presents the true story of Nancy's and Anthony's encounters with aliens. If you would like to explore more about their amazing experiences, and many others, check out my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters." Now available!

In 1956, ten-year-old Robert Hambly (pseudonym) was enjoying an afternoon of ice-skating with a dozen other children in a local park in the small town of Havre, Montana. Looking up, they were amazed to see several silvery spheres scooting across the sky. Robert had never heard about UFOs and had no idea what he was seeing, but he knew it wasn't normal.

Only a few days later, Robert's life changed forever. He awoke in the middle of the night to see a strange figure standing next to his bed. To Robert, the figure looked just like a three-foot-tall humanoid cat. It had a large, bald head, huge dark cat-like eyes, and a thin body. Unable to move, Robert was filled with fear. After a short time, the figure vanished. But for the next several years, Robert was visited over and over again.

Meanwhile, many miles away in Las Vegas, Nevada, a little girl, Melissa Branson, (pseudonym) woke up in her bedroom to see cat-like ETs moving through the wall. She told her parents who said Melissa must have had a nightmare. But Melissa knew better: she had been awake. And when it kept happening, she knew something very strange was happening to her.

Later, as a teen-ager, Melissa saw a UFO near her home, but still didn't connect it to her childhood visitations.

Both Melissa and Robert grew up, and many years later, they met, started dating, fell in love and got married. UFOs and aliens were the farthest thing from their minds. But in 1992, UFOs came roaring back into their lives. They watched the television miniseries "Intruders," and they realized that they both had very similar experiences with cat-like extraterrestrials. They also discovered that there was a history of UFO encounters on both sides of their families. 

Then came a series of more UFO sightings. It wasn't long after the UFO sightings that, one night, the cat-like ETs returned. Frightened and angry, Robert mentally fought with the ETs, vanquishing them from his life forever.

Robert and Melissa's case contains unique and interesting elements that provide some important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon. Both feel that they were contacted by the same group of ETs who may have even brought them together. Both experienced telepathic contact with the UFOs. Perhaps most important, Robert was able to end his encounters by ordering the ETs to leave him alone. Their case is an important addition to our understanding of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet.

Born in 1960, Jill Wheeler (pseudonym) had her first UFO encounter when she was only five years old. A group of three-foot-tall figures dressed up like teddy bears entered her home and told her to follow them. A closer look revealed them to be typical grays. A short conversation ensued, at which point the ETs brought out a mysterious black box and set it up in the middle of her bedroom. A strange procedure followed, and after a little while, the grays left. That was Jill's first experience. But it wouldn't be her last.

Around age nine, the grays returned, and began to teach Jill secret lessons. Unfortunately, Jill couldn't remember what they taught her. The grays returned a few days later and shared more information with her. And over the next three years, they visited more than 100 times, always with the purpose of teaching Jill secret knowledge. The visits were always pleasant and fun, and Jill looked forward to them. In fact, the ETs showed her how to call them down using a special signal. Then, after three years, the encounters abruptly ended. And as the grays had warned her, she forgot about them completely.

A short time later, Jill and her best friend had a dramatic close-up sighting of a huge metallic craft. It was an encounter that would convince her that UFOs were real. 

After that, Jill's life returned to normal. She grew up, got married. She and her husband bought a home in a small town in Nebraska. She got pregnant with her first child, and shortly later had another kid. But it was shortly after she gave birth to her third child that weird experiences began to occur.

She had been diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child, and she had to have annual lung x-rays to monitor her condition. One year, Jill went to the doctor, and they discovered a strange unidentified object in her lungs. Doctors were unable to explain it.

More weirdness followed. Jill was changing her new baby's diaper when a tiny object fell out her nose. She instantly saw that this object wasn't natural. It was white and looked like a miniature spool. But what was it doing in her nose?

Following this event, Jill's health began to decline. She felt sick and dizzy, and rapidly lost weight. Her health slowly spiraled downward, and after three years, Jill was extremely weak, and was passing out multiple times daily. Doctors were unable to diagnose her condition. All they knew was that Jill was very sick.

Then, one evening in 1995, Jill was walking across her living room when suddenly she found herself inside what appeared to be a huge underground base. There was a domed ceiling, hundreds of small cubicles, and Jill was inside one of them lying on a cold, steel doctor's table. She was dazed and disoriented, and like other people who were there, was trying to figure out where she was. 

Suddenly, a strange nine-foot-tall humanoid entered her cubicle and said, "Okay, it's your turn now, Jill." Jill screamed in terror as the being began a mysterious medical procedure on her body.

During the procedure, Jill lost consciousness, and the next thing she knew, she was back in her home. Only now, her family would not wake up. It took her more than twenty minutes of shaking them before any of them would wake up.

Jill had no idea what had happened to her. But that evening, as she put her infant son to bed, he pointed at the moon and said, "Mommy! I went on a ship to the moon! Went on a ship to the moon!" 

Jill was shocked. Had her son been taken too? Even stranger, Jill noticed that although her body was very sore (a condition which persisted for two weeks,) she was feeling much better. In fact, the next day, she didn't lose consciousness at all. And as the days passed, she never passed out again, and she began to gain her weight back. Had the ETs healed her? And if so, why her? She was just a housewife from Nebraska.

Not long after that, Jill had another close-up sighting of a UFO that paced her car. And after that, she was taken again inside a UFO. This time she was shown a little baby who didn't quite look human. The ETs told her, "This is your baby."

Jill could ignore it no longer. She began doing research about her experiences and learned that she was a UFO contactee. But still she wondered, why her? And who was that nine-foot-tall alien? Had she really been taken to an underground base? Was that weird-looking baby truly hers? She still has many questions. And these are only some of the many strange encounters she had experienced.

This video presents the lifelong UFO encounters of Jill Wheeler, and is surely one of the strangest and most bizarre contact cases on record. To hear more about Jill's incredible encounters (and many others) check out the book, "INSIDE UFOS: TRUE ACCOUNTS OF CONTACT." Now available!

According to The Center for Disease Control and The World Health Organization, the leading cause of death in the world is heart disease. In fact, about one in four deaths are attributable to some form of heart disease. Since physical healings are a consistent feature of UFO encounters, it should come as no surprise that there are many cases of people who have been healed of heart disease by extraterrestrials.

This video presents more than a dozen cases of people healed of various heart conditions. The cases reach back decades and are still occurring today. Men, women and children all over the world are being visited and healed. 

--A young girl from California has an ET dream and wakes up to find herself healed of an enlarged heart.
--A man from Russia is invited aboard a UFO and is healed of a chronic heart condition by tall human-looking aliens.
--A man born with a hole in his heart receives numerous psychic healings from a gray alien by the name of Mazu.
--A man from Puerto Rico is visited by three short humanoids who tell him   is sick, and quickly proceed to heal him of heart disease.
--A woman from Ukraine dying from heart disease is visited in her hospital room by a glowing entity who heals her using orbs of light.
--A real-estate agent from Oregon is struck by lightning, then abducted by grays who tell her that her heart has been damaged, and they will fix it.
--A professor from Pennsylvania is visiting the Isle of Iona, is struck by a beam of light and experiences missing time. Later hypnotized by Dr. John Mack MD, he recalls being healed by a short reptilian humanoid of arterial sclerosis.

These are just a few of the many cases of people who claim to have been healed by extraterrestrials of a wide variety of heart conditions. These accounts show a benevolent side of UFO contact that is often ignored. They show that healing humanity is a primary ET agenda. They also show just how truly advanced the ETs are.

Located in southern California, the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the third busiest airport in the world. Millions of people from all across the planet travel to and from the airport each year. But it's not only people who are visiting LAX, aliens are too! UFOs are being seen here in large numbers!

In fact, airports all over the world are being targeted by UFOs. For some reason, the ETs are attracted to airports. And more than any other airport, LAX is a UFO magnet. There are at least a dozen cases of UFOs hovering over Los Angeles International Airport. These cases began in the early 1950s and are continuing to the present day. These are not distant sightings of unexplained lights in the sky, but often structured metallic craft seen at low elevation for long periods of time.

Metallic discs, cigar-shaped craft, triangular craft, spherical craft, all have been seen directly over LAX. Many of these are daylight sightings. They not only move directly over the airport; they display fantastic maneuvers and will even hover in place within full view of the airport control tower. 

LAX is located in a densely populated urban area. Many of these sightings involve large numbers of witnesses. These UFOs have been viewed by air-traffic controllers, pilots, baggage handlers, airport employees and numerous other people who live nearby. The objects have been caught on radar and even photographed. The cases themselves occur with incredible regularity and have often made newspaper and television headlines. Due to the brazen behavior of these objects, it is clear that they want to be seen and are intentionally showing themselves to people. The question is, why? Is there an agenda behind these sightings? Are ETs putting on a display to announce their presence? Why is it that LAX is such a powerful magnet of UFO activity?

This video presents a decades-long chronology of the UFO activity over one of the busiest airports on the planet, and it also reveals interesting insights about UFO behavior. The UFO activity over LAX is so intense that it proves that UFOs do, in fact, have an agenda to show themselves, apparently to convince people of the existence of UFOs.

In 1984, 24-year-old Don Anderson of Spanish Fork, Utah woke up to see a gray alien inside his bedroom, taking away his 4-year-old son. Don leaped out of bed and informed the gray that if they were going to take his son, he wanted to join them. The gray agreed. Both Don and his son were taken onboard a craft where they were greeted by a female human-looking ET who gave them a tour of the craft. The ET informed Don of several events which would soon occur in his personal life. Don and his son were then returned.

This event caused a radical shift in Don's life. He recognized the gray as a friend and teacher, and he remembered having encountered him before. In fact, several bizarre events which Don had ignored, denied or explained away now suddenly made sense, and he realized he had been experiencing UFO contact his entire life. He remembered being visited and taken as a young boy. He remembered seeing a UFO and the gray at age ten, then being taken onboard a craft and taught how to perform telekinesis and about the aliens' technology. A missing time event at age fourteen now revealed itself to be an extensive onboard UFO encounter during which he was again taken beyond Earth and taught by the ETs. He even remembered a "pre-life" encounter during which his gray alien guide showed Don's mother giving birth to him!

Don, who had been religious, now realized that he was in contact with extraterrestrials. This began a lifelong search for answers. He also began experiencing a wide variety of paranormal events including precognition, out-of-body experiences, communication with spirits and more. And of course, more UFO encounters.

He once went camping with some friends (also UFO contactees) not far from the famous Skinwalker Ranch, hoping to initiate contact with praying mantis ETs. To the amazement of Don and his friends, a huge UFO showed up, followed by several mantis ETs. This culminated in a long and profound onboard encounter during which Don communicated with the praying mantis aliens who again gave him information about his personal life and showed him many strange and wonderful things onboard the craft.

It wasn't long before more encounters occurred. On one occasion, Don was visited by a familiar human-looking ET who cured him of a chest cold. On another occasion he was taken onboard and treated for a heart problem.

Don's encounters attracted the attention of the U.S. military who threatened him not to talk about his experiences. As a result, Don decided to go public. He spoke at conventions and began doing interviews and writing about his experiences. He even put together a website called "Path of Shaballa" (link below) to share the spiritual information he learned at the hands of the ETs. Shaballa can be translated as "Wisdom of the Ancient Ones."

Don's case is more extensive than most. He has worked hard to understand his encounters, learn from them, and share the wisdom he has been given. He says that while people are very interested in the physical aspects of his encounters, it is the spiritual information that is the most important and is the reason he decided to go public.

Don's full story is told in my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters," now available.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0949H5Y8G/...

The state of Arizona has played a powerful role in shaping our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. In fact, many of the world's most influential UFO cases have taken place here. Sightings, UFO waves, hot-spots, radar cases, UFO landings, photographic cases, face-to-face encounters, onboard UFO experiences, government cover-ups, UFO crash/retrievals -- Arizona has them all.

Part One of this two-part episode presented a countdown of the top twenty cases from number twenty down to number eleven. Now, in Part Two, we countdown Arizona's top ten best cases. These are the cases that have defined the UFO phenomenon. Some of them have garnered national headlines, and others are not well-known but deserve to be placed in the annals of UFO history. The time for skepticism is over. We must now face the fact that UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are visiting our planet, and these are the cases that prove it.

While UFO encounters occur all across the planet, some places are more active than others. One such location is the state of Arizona. In fact, the Grand Canyon state has produced some of the world's most famous and influential encounters.

After reviewing thousands of UFO cases from Arizona, I have compiled a list of what I think are the top twenty best cases in the state. These cases include well-known influential cases, cases of high credibility, cases that contain unique or unusual elements, cases that provide important insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon, and more! Sightings, landings, UFO waves, photographic cases, face-to-face encounters with humanoids, abductions, UFO crash/retrievals -- the state of Arizona has them all.

Part One of this two-part video presents a countdown of cases, from number twenty to number eleven. Part Two presents a countdown of the top ten. With so many cases to choose from, a list like this can only provide a brief glimpse into the vast number of cases. But there are enough accounts to offer a broad understanding of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial presence on planet Earth.

All of these cases and more appear in my book, "UFOs over Arizona: A True History of Extraterrestrial Encounters in the Grand Canyon State." Now available!

This is the true story of "Lisa," a daycare worker from northern California who has had lifelong contacts with extraterrestrials. Lisa is not her real name. Although she did go public with her encounters, she now prefers to remain private. Lisa's encounters began in 1972, around age 5, when she was approached by a tall praying mantis alien while in her backyard. Next thing she knew, an hour had passed, and she was being returned to her home. Following this, her encounters occurred regularly, almost always involving praying mantis-type ETs.

Her next major encounter occurred at age 14, while scuba diving on Catalina Island in southern California. She was abducted into a UFO and underwent what appears to be the extraction of a hybrid-baby fetus from her womb. It was a terrifying experience and left her both physically sore and emotionally shaken.

Then, one evening in November of 1992, Lisa was driving with a friend along the 101 Ventura Freeway outside of Los Angeles, California when a UFO swooped down and began to pace their car. Without warning, it sent down a beam of light, striking their vehicle. Time seemed to stop as the two women were pulled from the car, up the beam of light and into the craft. So began one of the most extensive encounters of Lisa's life.

Onboard, Lisa and her friend were separated. Lisa saw her friend being shown star maps, while Lisa herself was taken to another room, undressed and given a physical examination. The ETs told her not to be afraid, that she was a part of their project, and they had to do this. 

Following the exam, Lisa was shown what appears to be the engine room or the power source of the craft. She was then given a long and very personal message containing details of her private life, and she was told several prophecies and predictions which the ETs told her would later occur. And as the ETs predicted, these events did in fact happen. Finally, the two women were reunited on the craft and sent back to their car via a levitating beam of light.

More encounters would soon occur. Two years later, in 1994, Lisa became a participant in a mass UFO abduction event on Coronado Island in California. Up to a dozen people experienced a visitation on the same night. It would be the first time Lisa encountered gray aliens.

Lisa's encounters are too numerous to count. She's been taken onboard many times. Often she is handed hybrid babies, half-human, half-alien and told to love and nurture them while the aliens observe. 

Lisa's case involves physical evidence of various kinds. She has had numerous unexplained nosebleeds, strange marks on her body, a possible implant and more. While many details of her encounters were recalled under hypnosis, Lisa is one of a small portion of contactees who are able to remember their experiences without hypnosis.  Her story is one of great personal struggle and triumph. It's a story that has much to reveal about what it's like to have ET contact, and the ET agenda on our planet.

If you'd like to explore more about Lisa's experiences, her account is told in my book, "The Coronado Island UFO Incident." Now available!

On April 22, 1994, in the middle of the night, former Navy officer and postal worker Bill Shellhart was driving along a desert highway in New Mexico when he saw strange glowing lights ahead of him on the road. As the lights approached him, Bill realized he was seeing an actual flying saucer. It hovered above his car flashing down beams of light. Terrified, Bill raced away down the highway. Little did he know, his encounter had only just begun.

Looking around him, he noticed that the landscape around him had mysteriously transformed from flat desert to mountains covered with trees. And looking ahead of him on the road, he was shocked to see a massive roiling cloud-like mass sweeping towards his car. The weird cloud engulfed him, and the next thing Bill knew, he was many miles from his original location. 

This was Bill's first encounter, but it would not be his last. This missing time encounter was followed by a series of sightings and close encounters. One year later, a UFO paced his car along a remote desert highway. He began seeing UFOs over his home in Hawaii. He woke up one evening to find a brilliant light filling his bedroom. He would wake up to find strange triangular marks on his body. He noticed that some of his chronic medical problems were miraculously healed.

Meanwhile, Bill's wife, Rose, revealed that she had also had UFO encounters. As a young girl, she was mysteriously rescued from drowning. In 1977, she had a very close-up sighting of a metallic domed saucer with portholes and colored lights which sent down a beam of light, burning the grass near her home in Pasadena, California. She later met Bill and they fell in love and became married. Rose reports that she'd often wake up in the early morning hours when her husband would be dropped back in bed. Bill would then tell her about his strange dream-like experiences of being onboard a craft where he was taught by the ETs.

Then, in the mid 1990s, Bill and Rose were vacationing in Sedona, Arizona. Driving along a highway late at night, they were followed by a mysterious glowing light. For the next half-hour, the light circled around their car, getting closer and closer. Without warning, it dropped from the sky and landed in a field alongside the road. The next thing Bill and Rose knew, hours had passed, and they were approaching their hotel. 

Realizing they had experienced another missing time encounter, they decided to go under hypnosis. They learned that they had not been abducted, but instead they had been invited onboard a craft where they met friendly human-looking ETs who had an important message for them.

The UFO encounters of Bill and Rose continued, and both became spiritually transformed. They look upon the ETs as friends and teachers, and they have agreed to share their experiences with the world.

The full story of the UFOs of Bill and Rose (and several other accounts) is presented in my book, "Extraterrestrial Visitations: True Accounts of Contact." Available on Amazon!

On June 15, 1965, fourteen-year-old Ron C. of New Kensington, Pennsylvania spent the afternoon skateboarding with his two friends. At 7:00 p.m., they had just returned to Ron's home when a huge flying saucer appeared overhead. All three boys stared upward in amazement as a window opened in the craft, revealing the silhouettes of two human-looking figures gazing down at them. Other people around town had recently reported seeing UFOs, and now Ron realized that he and his friends were seeing an actual alien craft.

Ron was overcome with awe, and he thought to himself, how wonderful it would be if he could take a ride onboard the UFO. He lifted his arms and began waving at the UFO people, mentally asking them if they would take him onboard.

So began an adventure that would affect Ron for the rest of his life. His benevolent experience with human-looking extraterrestrials was his first and most profound encounter, but it would be followed by many other sightings. As he grew up, got married and had children, his entire family would become involved. 

Ron's onboard UFO encounter lasted three full hours. And although he doesn't remember everything that happened, he remembers enough to provide him with some interesting and unusual insights into the nature of UFOs and the people who pilot them. According to Ron, humanity will be experiencing some profound and world-shaking revelations that will forever change how everybody thinks about the UFO phenomenon.

Ron's account is one of fifteen cases presented in my book, "Onboard UFO Encounters." Now available!

UFO encounters are known for their high strangeness. While cases of alien contact do have many similarities, each case is also unique, and sometimes contains bizarre and unusual details never reported before. One such case of very high strangeness comes from a gentleman by the name of James Santiago. 

James Santiago was a popular and successful nightclub performer. In 1982, James and a friend, a world-famous artist named Cleo Jensen (pseudonym,) began a two-day-long road-trip through the Canadian Rockies. What James didn't know is that Cleo was a UFO contactee. Shortly after their trip began, Cleo revealed her secret and told James that she was being followed by UFOs, and that she had been having ET contact her whole life.

James had never given much thought to UFOs, and he wasn't sure what to think about his friend's strange announcement. And then, while in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, Cleo announced that a UFO was coming, and they were about to have an extraterrestrial encounter. 

So began one of the strangest events in James's life. A glowing green flying saucer appeared and began to pace their vehicle. And then events went from strange to bizarre, forever altering the course of James's life. The first encounter was followed by several others, one after another, leaving James with a whole new awareness, not only of humanity's place in the universe, but of his own life. James began to look at other unexplained events in his life, from childhood onwards, and realized that he himself was very likely a UFO contactee.

This unique account of UFO contact reveals some interesting and profound insights into the nature of the UFO phenomenon, and it shows just how bizarre and strange UFO contact can be.

UFOs are seen all across our planet. The same is true for extraterrestrials. In fact, ETs are sometimes seen in locations you'd least expect. It may sound incredible, but the truth is, people are seeing ETs in public, walking among the general population. And it's not just a few cases. There are a lot of them.

Convenience stores, schools, bookshops, restaurants, theaters, churches, buses, subways, casinos, gas-stations, hotel lobbies, train stations and more -- no place is off limits. These reports include a wide variety of grays and strange humanoids. 

How can this happen? Have ETs infiltrated our society? What are they doing? Why are they here?  Cases like these raise all kinds of questions!

This video presents nearly 20 different cases of ETs mingling in public places. The cases show some startling similarities and provide some important insights into the UFO phenomenon. You may have seen an ET and not even know it!

Many people all across the world are having lifelong contacts with UFOs and extraterrestrials. However, some cases are more extensive than others. One such case comes from a gentleman named Tim. Born in Louisiana, Tim has worked as a police officer, security guard, sports instructor and more. His UFO contacts began around age six with a dramatic UFO sighting in front of his home. Following that, he had a series of sightings, missing time events, face-to-face contact, and onboard UFO encounters.

While Tim's contacts were initially shrouded in missing time (he once was missing for more than an entire day!) -- he began to have dreams and flashbacks of what had happened to him. Some of Tim's experiences are highly unusual and a few might be unique. On one occasion, Tim remembers waking up onboard a UFO, and wandering around until suddenly he came upon a gray alien. Consumed with fear, Tim reached back and punched the gray in the head. At that point, a crowd of ETs converged upon him. On another occasion, he was taken to the control room and was taught by the ETs how to fly the craft. He even has some insights into how the UFO engines actually work. One of his most unusual experiences is being taken to a "waiting room" with other abductees where they are able to levitate at will. These are a just a few of Tim's many encounters.

Tim's story has multiple witnesses and physiological evidence in support of his case. His experiences reveal some unique and startling insights about what it's like to have contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials.

UFOs and extraterrestrials have been around for thousands of years. The evidence shows that they have been with us since recorded history. Clearly, they are very interested in us.

What is our relationship with the ETs, and particularly, the grays? Could they be our ancestors? Are they time travelers from the future? Have they intervened in humanity's evolution? Why do virtually all reports of aliens involve humanoids? And what about the fact that some ETs look just like us? There are many questions and mysteries surrounding UFOs and our relationship with them.

This video presents more than a dozen cases from across the world in which the ETs have provided information and answers to these questions. These cases show that our relationship with the ETs might be much closer than many people realize. We are not alone in the universe. And as these cases will show, the separation between "us" and "them" might be an illusion. We are all one!

Born in New York, Tony Ditata had his first UFO sighting at age seventeen, while walking outside his home in Brentwood. A few years later, he experienced a dramatic face-to-face encounter with a gray alien on the local golf course. Before long, he started having memories of being taken onboard a craft. Soon more encounters followed: sightings, missing-time, onboard experiences and more face-to-face encounters. When Tony realized finally accepted that he was a UFO abductee, he sought regressive hypnosis and recalled an incredible experience where he and his girlfriend were taken onboard a massive disc which had landed alongside the road in upstate New York.

Tony's encounters span the gamut of the UFO experience, with virtually every type of encounter, some of which are extremely bizarre. At one point, he was able to meet with who he believes is his hybrid-ET daughter, or as he calls her, his "Star Daughter." Along with the UFO encounters came various paranormal experiences, such as poltergeist encounters, past life memories and more.

Tony's encounters have left him profoundly changed, and have left him a whole new view of life on Earth and beyond. His story provides a fascinating glimpse into the life of a contactee.

This video presents Tony's story in his own words. You will hear his story firsthand as he describes his encounters, and how they have affected him and altered the course of his life.

Where is the most likely place to see an extraterrestrial? As strange as it may sound, one of the most commonly reported encounters is known as a "bedroom visitation." In case after case, people report waking up at night to find gray aliens in their bedroom. For many witnesses, a bedroom visitation is the experience that wakes them up to the realization that they are having lifelong encounters with extraterrestrials.

This video presents three different cases of people who experienced a bedroom visitation by gray aliens. Each is unique, not only in content, but in how the witnesses react.

CASE ONE "Connie" is visited in her third story apartment bedroom in Washington State by silver-suited grays, causing a huge transformation, physically, mentally and spiritually.

CASE TWO: "Madison" had seen UFOs before, but had no idea that she was in actual contact until she was visited by grays in the bedroom of her apartment in White Plains, New York. Only then did she examine her past and realize that she had been having contact her entire life.

CASE THREE "Evelyn" had never thought much about UFOs until she woke up in her bedroom to see several grays who told her that they were on a mission. Evelyn felt no fear, and would later have more encounters during which she received urgent messages for all humankind.

Bedroom visitations are far more common than most people realize. It doesn't matter if you live in the country or in the heart of a crowded city, the ETs can find you. These three cases have volumes to reveal about the ET agenda, what it's like to have a bedroom visitation, and the incredible after-effects of contact.

If you would like to explore more about these three cases and many others, check out my books, "Inside UFOs: True Accounts of Contact," "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters," and "Onboard UFO Encounters." Now available!

There are several very famous incidents involving Schoolyard UFO Encounters. The Ariel Elementary School Incident in Ruwa, Zimbabwe; the Westall High School Incident in Melbourne, Australia; the Broadhaven Elementary School Incident in Wales; the Crestview Elementary School incident in Opa-Locka, Florida; and the Hillsdale College incident, in Hillsdale, Michigan (to name a few!) But what many people don't know is that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg. There are well over 100 documented cases of UFOs hovering over schools. Not only hovering, but in about 1/3 of the cases, the UFOs land and/or humanoids are seen.

This video presents two incredible cases, both which occurred in May of 1977, separated by four days and less than 100 miles. Unlike the above cases, these received zero publicity, and were very nearly lost to history. In this video, you will hear the  testimony from the fathers of two young schoolgirls who were firsthand witnesses to a Schoolyard UFO Encounter.

The first case took place on May 2, 1977, at an un-named elementary school in Downey, California. The case involves a very low-level sighting, has multiple witnesses and some very unusual effects. The second case took place on May 6, 1977 at Ocean Knoll Elementary school. It involves humanoids and an apparent landing. 

Schoolyard UFO Encounters have been occurring since at least 1950, and are still occurring today. These are not normal sightings. Unlike your average encounter, these cases are almost exclusively daylight encounters, very low level, long-lasting and involve many, many witnesses. ETs are targeting schools in an apparent agenda to announce their presence to the world in a very subtle way. The question is, why?

Although UFO abduction cases number in the thousands (or in the millions according to some researchers!) there is an almost complete lack of cases observed by outside witnesses. UFOs are almost never caught in the act of abducting someone. How is this possible? How can so many abductions go completely unseen?

This scarcity of outside witnesses has caused some researchers to speculate that UFO abductions may be mental events with no basis in physical reality. However most UFO investigators are well aware of why there are so few witnesses. The main reasons seem to be that outside observers are put in a trance, made to forget, or are diverted to other locations. In other words, the mysterious absence of outside witnesses is apparently no accident. 

But nobody's perfect, not even ETs. Surely there must be some cases where somebody saw an abduction take place. And as a matter of fact, there are cases of observed abductions. But they are shockingly rare, so uncommon as to be almost statistically insignificant. But they do happen.

This video presents twenty cases in which ETs have been caught in the act of abducting someone. These accounts show that sometimes, on very rare occasions, outside observers are put in a position to witness events that almost nobody else gets to see.

These cases raise many questions. How and why do so many abductions go unobserved? Is the fact that some are observed an accident or is it intentional? What do these cases tell us about the nature of the UFO phenomenon and how advanced the ETs actually are? 

The cases presented here will hopefully provide some insights and answers to these many questions. If you would like to explore more about cases of observed abductions, you might be interested in my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three."  Now available.

Deep underwater, a few miles off the coast of Malibu, California, lies a massive and mysterious stone structure. With a large flat top and what appears to be giant columns and an entrance into a dark tunnel, the "Malibu Anomaly" has become famous across the world. Some say that it's a natural geological formation, while others believe it's an undersea UFO base. Which is the truth?

Natural or artificial, the structure is located in the center of a well-known UFO hotspot known as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro Channel. More than 150 documented cases of UFOs and "USOs" (unidentified submersible objects,) surround the area. Reports reach back more than 100 years and are still continuing to the present day. 

How old is this formation? If it is a construction, then who built it and why? Is the government aware of it? Could it actually be an undersea UFO base? Is it evidence of ancient aliens? Its unusual appearance, and the fact that there are so many UFO and USO reports lend credence to this theory. However, skeptics point out that there is no hard evidence proving that this structure is, in fact, made by extraterrestrials.

In this video, we take a deep dive into all the known evidence, and objectively examine everything that has been learned about this extraordinary structure known as the Malibu Anomaly. We will look at the distribution of the UFO and USO accounts in this area. We will hear of reports from UFO experiencers who may have actually been taken inside the base. We will hear theories and conclusions from scientists and ufologists who conducted firsthand investigations, including sending down an unmanned submersible to take a close-up look at the structure. We will examine this structure from every angle and see if we can come up with answers to the many mysteries surrounding the Malibu Anomaly.

If you would like to take an even deeper look at the Malibu Anomaly, and the 150 UFO/USO reports surrounding it, and more, you may want to check out my book, "Undersea UFO Base: An In-Depth Investigation into USO Activity in the Santa Catalina Channel." Now available!

Your chances of being struck by lightning are very slim, only about 1 in 50,000. And yet, each year approximately 2000 people are killed by lightning strikes. Many more people suffer severe injuries. However, very rarely, something strange and miraculous happens: people are actually healed. As strange as this sounds, lightning has actually cured people of a wide variety of illnesses and diseases. 

Being cured by lightning may sound like science fiction, but it's actually very well documented. Cases reach back all the way to the 1700s and are still occurring today. Men, women and children all across the planet have reported these healings, many of which are verified by doctors. People have been cured of paralysis, cancer, blindness, deafness, rheumatism,  typhoid fever, asthma, muscular dystrophy and more. There are even a few cases involving animals! What is it about lightning that is causing people to be healed?

Lightning has some very interesting properties. It is extremely hot (3 times hotter than the surface of the sun.) It is also highly magnetic. People are not only healed by lightning, they are sometimes levitated off the ground. 

Some of these effects are shockingly similar to beams of lights from UFOs. In fact, there are now more than 300 documented cases of UFO healings. Many of the UFO healings are done using beams of light. UFO beams are also known to burn people, levitate them, cause temporary paralysis and more. Have the ETs learned how to harness the mysterious properties of lightning? One thing is certain, they know more about the electromagnetic spectrum than we do.

What is it like to be healed by lightning? How do these cases take place? What do they have to teach us about the power of light?

This video presents more than 30 cases of people who have been healed as the result of a lightning strike. These cases reveal a mysterious and powerful aspect of light that we have yet to understand.

If you would like to explore more about lightning cures, and healings by UFO beams, you may be interested in my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs: 300 True Accounts of People Healed by Extraterrestrials." The book also contains a section on people who have been healed by lightning. Now available!

Is there a government coverup of UFOs? The answer appears to be a resounding yes. Judging from the countless blacked-out documents released through the Freedom of Information Act from multiple intelligence agencies, the public is not being told the whole truth about the UFO phenomenon. This fact is further corroborated by the many government whistleblowers who have stepped forward and revealed their own participation in secret UFO projects.

Now a new whistleblower and government UFO insider has decided it's time to tell his story. "Thomas," a retired Navy officer, is now ready to let the world know about his own experiences. Thomas held a secret clearance in the Navy, but after retiring, was contacted by a Pentagon officer and was invited into the inner sanctum of the secret government working with UFO crash/retrievals. Thomas learned shocking details that would leave him forever changed. This video tells the story of what Thomas learned about what is really going on within the United States government, and their interest in UFOs and aliens. Crashed UFOs being held at military bases. ETs working along with the military. An underground city at Area 51. The truth is finally coming out!

A vast number of people have experienced direct contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. However, for some people, this contact is more extensive than most. One of these individuals is a man by the name of Taylor Foster. A chiropractor from Missouri, Taylor has experienced UFO encounters for his entire life. His first dramatic encounter occurred at age 11 when a UFO hovered over him, sent down a beam of light and caused missing time. In the days that followed, Taylor began to remember what had happened during this period of amnesia. He met beautiful human-looking aliens who held a long philosophical conversation with him.

Following this incredible event, Taylor's life changed dramatically. His intelligence and awareness increased profoundly, and his UFO encounters began to occur at a fast and furious rate. He began having more missing time encounters and face-to-face meetings with gray-type ETs. His experiences continued, and he soon had literally hundreds of sightings and many much closer encounters.

Before long, Taylor started having fully conscious encounters, and was able to converse with the grays, who taught him various things, such as how they are able to carry humans in their craft while darting around and moving at high speeds, or how they are able to move through solid walls. They told him about implants and more.

Taylor has not felt any fear during his encounters, and instead feels that the ETs are his friends, or even family. He has developed a strong and close relationship with them, and his encounters continue to this day. 

This video presents the incredible story of Taylor Foster's lifelong encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials, and provides many insights into the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon.

When somebody has a close encounter and are taken onboard a UFO, it is not unusual for them to return with strange markings on their body. Often this may take the form of a scoop mark, bruises, or puncture marks. Much more rare are weird alien symbols. And yet, over and over again, people who meet extraterrestrials and have an onboard encounter are left with an unexplained alien symbol somewhere on their body. 

These symbols can be simple, such as the shape of a triangle, or more complex, such as foreign-looking letters, hieroglyphic-like designs, or weird symbolic patterns of obviously intelligent design.

This video presents several cases of abductees and experiencers who have returned from their encounters bearing these alien symbols on their skin. One of the cases presented here is among the strangest on record. There are now enough cases now to make it clear that something very profound is happening here. 

What do these symbols mean? Are they the result of an extraterrestrial medical procedure? Could this be a symptom of an alien implant? Are ETs tagging humans like we do to animals? Are they tattooing people with an alien symbol for tracking purposes? Are they calling cards, proof for the witness that something unusual has happened to them?

These are questions which hopefully some of these cases will be able to answer!

If you would like to explore more about cases involving alien symbols, you might be interested in checking out my book, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters," which presents the case of Linda, and her incredible experience involving alien symbols on the skin.

Most UFO encounters are simple sightings. Sometimes, however, UFOs get very close. In these cases, what starts out as a sighting transforms into face-to-face contact with the unknown. Accounts like these provide far more information than just a sighting.

This video presents three cases of very close encounters with UFOs. When UFOs get this close, there is virtually no possibility of misidentification. 

Case One: Three children are walking near their home in Mount Olive, Louisiana when a UFO drops down from the sky, hovers twenty feet over their heads, and strikes them with a beam of light.

Case Two: Four teenagers drive up a winding dirt road into the mountains of San Dimas, California and are confronted by a gigantic UFO which has landed in a field. Surrounding the craft are several strange figures, one of whom approaches them.

Case Three: Two young friends sitting outside a library in Koreatown, California watch as a saucer-shaped craft drops down from the sky and hovers over the powerlines. The mother of one of the girls arrives to drive them home, and the UFO follows them over their car, beginning an ordeal that they will remember for the rest of their lives.

These three cases of very close encounters show how quickly a sighting can become something much more complicated. Each of these unique and fascinating accounts has something profound to teach us about UFOs and these strange extraterrestrial visitors to our planet.

People from all walks of life have UFO encounters, and that includes celebrities. In fact, more and more famous people are now stepping forward to reveal their own sightings, or in some cases, actual face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials. Actors, singers, sports stars -- a huge number of superstars have had dramatic encounters with UFOs and aliens. 

This video presents more than 70 celebrity UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, UFO photographs, face-to-face meetings and even onboard UFO encounters -- they're all here.  Many of these stars have faced intense ridicule and skepticism, but they are sticking to their stories. They not only believe in UFOs, they know!

What happens when a hugely famous person sees a UFO? Could the ETs be contacting famous people intentionally? Are the ETs reaching out to famous people because they know that celebrities have profound influence upon millions of people and have a platform to reach a very wide audience?  Some of these cases seem to indicate this.

Whatever the reason, the list of superstars who have seen UFOs is longer than you might think. The seventy-plus cases presented here  are likely just the tip of the iceberg. Hopefully this will inspire many other famous people to admit the truth about their own UFO encounters.

This video is dedicated to the late Timothy Green Beckley, author of "UFOs Among the Stars," one of the first books about celebrity UFO encounters.

Millions of people across our planet have seen UFOs. Some people see UFOs and also experience missing time. When a witness experiences missing time, this is a very strong indication of a possible onboard UFO encounter. In case after case, people who have a close-up sighting experience a period of amnesia, and are unable to recall what happened during the missing time.

Missing time used to be thought of as very rare, but now investigators believe it might be fairly common, involving perhaps as many as one in fifty people. If true, this would mean that millions of people have been taken onboard UFOs.

This video presents three cases of UFO encounters with missing time:

CASE ONE: A mother and her two daughters are confronted by three objects. As they rush home to get a camera and binoculars, they mysteriously forget everything.

CASE TWO: A man in Malibu begins meditating and trying to call down UFOs.  After a series of sightings, he experiences a mysterious event in which a UFO apparently lands in his backyard.

CASE THREE: Two friends driving along a remote desert highway late at night come upon a glowing object which strikes them with a beam light, causing missing time, followed by a radical shift in their lives.

What is it like to see a UFO close up and experience missing time?  How does it affect a witness? How do people deal with this kind of an encounter and still try to live a normal life? 

This video is a glimpse into the experience of missing time and the secret life of UFO contactees. While having missing time does involve amnesia, it is also ironically an unforgettable experience, one that witnesses think about every day of their lives.

Nearly every aspect of UFOs and extraterrestrials has been studied in detail. Investigators have researched cases involving landing traces, radar-returns, animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic effects, UFO propulsion, ...the list goes on and on! One aspect of Ufology that has been largely overlooked, however, is: the smell of UFOs!

The sense of smell plays a powerful role in human perception, and is closely connected to memory. And with amnesia exhibiting itself in so many UFO encounters, the importance of smell in connection to aliens and UFOs becomes even more profound.

This video presents more than 30 cases involving witnesses who smelled unusual odors during their UFO encounter. These cases have occurred over many decades and come from all across our planet, and yet they are surprisingly consistent. Over and over again, people report odors that are remarkably similar. An exploration of these cases reveals some surprising and significant insights into the nature and origins of UFOs and extraterrestrials.

What do aliens and UFOs smell like? What do these scents tell us about these mysterious visitors to our planet? The answers may surprise you!

On the morning of January 17, 1994, a massive 6.8 earthquake struck the city of Northridge, California. It caused millions of dollars worth of damage, destroyed hundreds of structures, and 57 people lost their lives. What many people don't know about is the UFO connection.

On the night before this encounter, several people in the surrounding area had incredible UFO encounters. One of the witnesses, Marcellina X., was a resident of nearby Topanga Canyon. In the hours preceding the Northridge Quake, Marcellina experienced a series of precognitive events, and along with her boyfriend (and others) saw numerous UFOs. This led to a profound spiritual transformation and two weeks later, a face-to-face encounter with gray extraterrestrials. The ETs had a personal message for her that caused huge changes in Marcellina's outlook and worldview. Her life would never be the same. 

This video tells the story of Marcellina's strange encounters and the weird UFO connection to the Northridge Earthquake of 1994. This is one of many cases in which people have seen UFOs before major disasters. This case also provides some of the answers to the aliens' agenda on our planet.

It is well-known among UFO investigator's that there is a contagion factor with UFO encounters. If you associate closely with a UFO contactee, this greatly increases your own chance of having a UFO encounter.

As a general rule, UFO researchers try to remain objective, which guards against distorting the evidence with a one's personal viewpoints about the phenomenon. However, by jumping into the middle of an active UFO case, UFO researchers run the considerable risk of  losing objectivity by becoming involved in the events as they happen. And sooner or later, this objectivity can be completely shattered when the UFO investigators become, in turn, investigated by UFOs.

It is a clear-cut case of the hunter becoming the hunted. The extraterrestrials are able to turn the tables with startling ease, and overnight a UFO investigator can be transformed into a UFO abductee. And this has, in fact happened to several UFO researchers who have plunged headlong into cases involving UFO abductions.

This also works in the other direction. Many UFO witnesses are so impressed by their own encounters, that they themselves begin to investigate UFOs, sometimes becoming highly influential in the field of ufology. In some cases, researchers believe they were destined by the ETs to become involved in investigating UFOs.

This is the phenomenon known as "UFO Investigator's Disease." A surprising number of researchers suffer from this condition. Many have gone public, however, others are keeping this a secret. And others might be completely unaware that they themselves have been contacted by aliens!

What happens when a UFO researcher contracts UFO investigator's disease? Does investigating UFOs truly run the risk of attracting UFOs? How many researchers suffer from this condition?

This video presents twenty cases of "UFO Investigator's Disease." You just might be shocked to see the names of the prominent researchers who have found themselves the target of UFOs.

Hundreds of books about UFOs and extraterrestrials are published each year. In fact, there are so many books, that it is nearly impossible for anyone to read them all. Many of these books are re-hashes of old material. Others are simply not very good. Many fantastic books get buried under an avalanche of mediocre books.

Today, there are many thousands of UFO books, and yet only a small portion have made a truly valuable contribution to our understanding of UFOs and extraterrestrials. With so many books flooding the market, how then is someone able to differentiate between the good, the bad and the ugly? How can we choose which books to invest our precious time and money in?

Of course, what constitutes a great book is a matter of subjective opinion. And yet, excellent research is fairly easy to identify.  Many people have asked, what are the best UFO books? Which books are worth reading? This video presents a top fifty countdown of what (IMHO as a longtime UFO researcher) are among the best UFO books ever written. 

These are the UFO books that are considered classics of ufology, books that have become runaway bestsellers, books that have been well received by the UFO community, books that have undeniably shaped our understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Hopefully this list will give the prospective reader a starting point, or offer some suggestions for books that will provide an accurate, truthful and interesting overview of the very complicated subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials.

UFOs have visited virtually every location on this planet, but one of the most active areas in the world is the state of New Mexico. Some of the world's most famous and influential encounters have taken place here. These are cases that have helped shape our understanding of the UFO phenomenon.

Part One of this video presents the best cases from number twenty down to number eleven. Now, in Part Two, we explore the top ten cases, moving from number ten all the way to number one! Sightings, landings, photographic cases, face-to-face meetings with extraterrestrials, onboard UFO encounters, UFO crashes -- they're all here. These top ten cases cover the entire gamut of the UFO phenomenon, and provide conclusive evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials. These "best of the best" cases will change the way you feel about UFOs.

Compared to UFOs, reports of USOs (unidentified submersible objects) are relatively rare. Even more rare are reports of USOs with humanoids. Only a small handful of these kinds of cases exist. And yet, the stretch of water known as the Santa Catalina/San Pedro Channel, along the southern California coast, has produced several USO cases with humanoids.

This video presents three such cases, all in close proximity to each other. The first case involves a UFO landing on a beach at Playa Del Rey, an encounter that has stunning new corroboration. The  second case involves a baffling USO encounter off the coast of Catalina Island, an incident which involves many strange aspects that have yet to be explained. The third (and perhaps most remarkable) case occurred at Lake Casitas (a human-made reservoir,) located a short ways inland on the northern end of the Santa Catalina channel. In this case, the witness actually managed to photograph the USO as it emerged from the lake. This entire area is extremely active and has produced more than 150 UFO/USO reports stretching back at least 100 years, and it is still going on today!

Why is this area so active? What happens when someone sees a USO with humanoids? What exactly is going on here? This video offers a small glimpse into one of the strangest aspects of USO activity in this area.

For those who would like to explore further, these cases and many others are presented in my book, "Undersea UFO Base: an In-depth Investigation into USOs in the Santa Catalina Channel." Now available!

In 1984, following the unexpected death of my mother from a heart-attack, I began having unusual experiences. First I saw her spirit appear to me as an apparition. Then I started having lucid dream-like encounters during which she would visit me in my bedroom. Then I started having out-of-body experiences.

Astral projection experiences have been reported for thousands of years, but I had no idea that anyone could have them. After working hard to learn how to have out-of-body experiences, I began to leave my body, explore the physical world, fly and walk through walls and more. I soon began to travel to the Other Side and had a wide variety of incredible experiences such as: meeting my mother and taking a tour of the heavenly realms, meeting with spirit guides, learning about past lives, basking in "the Light," learning in the Akashic Library, rescuing lost souls, and so much more. 

This video is the story of how I learned how to leave my body, and the wonderful experiences I had on Earth and in the many higher dimensions on the Other Side. I also present methods that anyone can use to have their own out-of-body experiences.

Is astral travel dangerous? What are the obstacles? Can anyone do it? What are the benefits? What kind of experiences can you have? What happens when you leave your body and travel into other dimensions. This video answers all these questions and more! Would you like to have an out-of-body experience? Are you willing to at least try?

Among the most commonly reported extraterrestrials types are grays, human-looking ETs and praying mantis. Another category, however, might be termed "strange humanoids." These include aliens that are only rarely reported or are apparently completely unique. 

This video presents three cases involving "strange humanoids." The first case involves a young child who was visited for a period of two weeks by strange blue-skinned dwarfs. The second involves a businessman who was confronted by three uniquely described, ten-foot-tall humanoids. The third case involves an artist/street-vendor who had a face-to-face encounter with a dark-eyed female figure who displayed her highly unusual appearance to the witness in very public place. In each of these cases, the ETs had a message that was specifically for the witnesses themselves.

These three cases show just how strange and unusual the UFO phenomenon can be, and that sometimes people see extraterrestrials that most people have never even heard of. These cases also show that extraterrestrials can appear in places that you would never expect.

There are many different types of extraterrestrials: grays, human-looking ETs, reptilians, tall whites, little blue beings, hairy dwarves and strange humanoids of all kinds. One well-known species are called praying mantis (or mantids.) These are usually described as being anywhere from six to nine feet tall, but can be both shorter or taller. Witnesses say they have an insectoid appearance much like a praying mantis or even a grasshopper, with long stick-like limbs, thin torsos, and massive dark eyes.

This video presents three separate cases, each involving a person who has had a face-to-face encounter with a praying mantis extraterrestrial. You will hear about a young married woman whose encounter was revealed during a hypnosis session. Another involving a college professor who had a missing time episode and then began having nightmares about being chased by a giant humanoid grasshopper. And a third case involving a teacher/daycare worker who encountered a praying mantis ET while out for her morning jog near her home.

What do the mantids look like? What is it like to have an encounter with a giant humanoid praying mantis? These three cases answer these questions and more. The witnesses have bravely stepped forward and revealed their encounters in the hopes of helping others who may have had similar experiences.

On March 16, 1967, an incredible event occurred at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, USA. Multiple UFOs hovered at very low elevation over the nuclear missiles sites, and were viewed by many military officers at the base. Then, one by one, the nuclear Minuteman ICBM missiles mysteriously went offline. The entire base went on high alert. There was an immediate investigation and a cover-up of the event. Years later, in 1994, one of the witnesses, Captain Robert Salas went public and disclosed the event. After locating other witnesses, Salas published the book, FADED GIANT in 2005, and the encounter became established in UFO History.

In 2015, retired army officer Mel Hansen was shocked to learn that the Malmstrom incident was being presented on television. He was a firsthand witness to the encounter, but had always kept his participation in the event a secret from everyone except a few family members. Now that it was being shown on TV, Mel decided that it was time for him to talk about what he saw on that amazing night.

This video presents the incredible story of Mel Hansen, and what he saw and experienced at Malmstrom AFB in March of 1967. It was an encounter that would drastically alter his life and leave him forever convinced of the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials. Mel's story provides further confirmation of one of the most important and profound cases in UFO history, a case that the Air Force is still trying to cover-up to this very day!

If you would like to explore more about Mel Hansen's encounter at Malmstrom AFB and his other UFO encounters, his story is told in my book, "WONDROUS: 25 TRUE UFO ENCOUNTERS," now available!

How would you like to hear a long conversation with someone who comes from another planet? Actually, you can! This video presents the testimony of a woman who actually recalls traveling from another world to planet Earth for a very specific mission. At first "Wendy" (pseudonym) had no idea that she was not from Earth. But after a series of dramatic encounters with gray aliens, Wendy began to remember her past as an extraterrestrial. She now remembers actually living a life on a planet far away from Earth, and then traveling to this planet to help teach humanity and awaken them to a whole new paradigm.

After years of keeping her experiences secret, Wendy has decided that now is the time to step forward and share her amazing story with the world. Why are the ETs here in such large numbers? What does the future hold for our planet. How can humanity move through the dramatic shift that is now taking place? Wendy answers all these questions and more. This is one of the most unusual cases of ET contact you have ever heard.

Unidentified Submersible Objects! UFOs aren't only flying around in our skies. They are also swimming around in our oceans, in our lakes and other bodies of water, perhaps in large numbers. A UFO becomes a USO the instant it hits the water and disappears beneath the surface. 

What are USOs doing in our oceans? How many of them are there? Where are they going and why are they down there? Until recently, there hasn't been very much research into USO activity. Now, however, there are hundreds of documented cases.

This video presents five USO cases involving high strangeness, including:

--Four teenagers encounter a USO in Lake Hamilton, Arkansas and experience an episode of missing time.

--A young couple boating on Lake Miccosukee in Florida watch a UFO dive into the water and head straight for them, underwater.

--A married couple vacationing in the Bahamas find themselves targeted by a massive USO which swims directly under their boat.

--A man and woman walking along the California coast in Mendocino see a UFO dive into the water, and then later, watch it rise up and fly away.

--Three people attending a dinner party in Aptos, California watch a USO emerge from the ocean, fly over to the local Moss Landing power plant, and then do something which leaves them all speechless.

USOs are being seen all over our planet. It's time we start investigating these strange accounts and learn what secrets are hidden beneath the surface of our oceans, lakes and rivers.

Many Air Force Bases across the United States and the world have been visited by UFOs. But there is one specific Air Force base that may be at the top of the list: Edwards Air Force base. The shocking and astounding events that have occurred at Edwards Air Force base go way beyond mere UFO sightings. In fact, virtually the entire range of the UFO phenomenon is represented. There are sightings, landings, face-to-face meetings with ETs, UFO crashes, abductions, reverse engineering of UFO technology and more! 

Events began as early as 1947 and are still continuing today. Way back in 1947, a two-days-long series of sightings put the base on high alert and changed the way the Air Force viewed and handled the UFO phenomenon. Following this, the base was visited regularly. For some reason, Edwards AFB  has become a magnet for the UFO phenomenon. Few other locations on Earth have experienced the magnitude and frequency of UFO encounters.

This video presents a gripping chronological history of UFO activity at this highly technological location. You will hear about dozens of close-up sightings, the day a UFO landed on the runway and was filmed by Air Force officers, the alleged meeting with President Eisenhower and extraterrestrials, a little known UFO crash, multiple cases involving reverse-engineering of ET technology and so much more, including cases that have never been revealed before. The military has done their best to cover-up these events. But the truth can no longer remain hidden. The public deserves to know the truth. The US government has known for more than 70 years that UFOs and aliens are real. Now it's time that the world knows.

If you would like to learn more about the activity that is occurring at Edwards,  please check out my books, "Wondrous: 25 True UFO Encounters" and "UFOs over California: A True History of Extraterrestrials in the Golden State."

Do you believe that there are unknown creatures lurking in the depths of our lakes and oceans? The answer of course is, yes! Mainstream science discovers new species each year. And yet, some creatures still remain very  elusive.  Among these are lake monsters and sea serpents. Lakes and oceans across the United States and the world contain mysterious creatures that have yet to be identified by scientists. And the state of California is filled with them.

California alone has several lakes which have produced many reports of strange lake monsters. And you may be surprised to hear that the California coast is one of the leading producers of sea serpent reports in the world. These reports have been occurring for more than 100 years and yet, nobody knows what they are!

This video presents the baffling but true stories of several lakes in California which are believed to contain strange creatures. Lizzie of Lake Elizabeth, Elsie of Lake Elsinore, Hodgee of Lake Hodges, Tessie of Lake Tahoe...and more! Most startling are the dozens of reports of giant sea serpents up and down the California coast. Many of these reports are extremely well-verified, coming from highly credible witnesses who have put their sterling reputations on the line by coming forward with their own eyewitness accounts.

What do these creatures look like? How big are they? How often are they seen? The answers might surprise you. One thing seems certain, very large creatures exist on our planet that have yet to be discovered and identified.

High strangeness is at your fingertips. Are you ready to have your own encounter with the unknown? If you would like to explore more about lake monsters, sea serpents and other strange mysteries in California, check out "Supernatural California: A Golden State Guide." Your adventure is waiting!

A Ouija Board is a tool normally used for contacting and communicating with spirits. However, there are now many cases on record in which people do not contact ghosts...instead they contact aliens. In fact, many people not only communicate with ETs using a Ouija Board, they have initiated encounters, actually calling down UFOs and summoning aliens.

This video presents more than twenty firsthand cases involving the Ouija Board and UFO encounters. The connection is undeniable. In some cases witnesses were able to photograph UFOs and even the ETs themselves. Even stranger, some cases involve Bigfoot. UFOs are known for having high levels of strangeness. And these unique cases show just how strange the UFO phenomenon can be. 

How do people contact aliens and UFOs with a Ouija Board? Why does this method work? Is it dangerous? This video answers all these questions and more.

It is unknown how many people have been taken onboard UFOs, but it may be a lot. The problem is, many of these events are shrouded in missing time and amnesia. However, this is not always the case. Some people have fully conscious encounters. One of these people is a gentleman from England by the name of Gary. 

Ever since he was a young boy, Gary began having dramatic UFO sightings and face-to-face encounters with gray aliens. It wasn't long before he was taken onboard their craft and subjected to a wide variety of bizarre experiences. While many people recall only being physically examined, Gary recalls many other incredible experiences, many of which have rarely been reported in the UFO literature, and some which might be totally unique. Few people have the extensive recall of their experiences like Gary. His case contains both harrowing events and encounters that are incredibly humorous. It is one of the most unusual cases on record.

Humans can fly! In part one of this video, we explored ten outstanding cases of human levitation. In part two, we now explore the very best documented cases of people who have flown. These are not flying dreams or out of body experiences. These are cases in which people have physically levitated off the ground. Every single one of these top ten cases involves multiple outside witnesses (sometimes hundreds or even thousands) who viewed the levitations firsthand. In four of the cases, the levitations were actually photographed. Several of the levitators provided detailed descriptions of their own experience, including how they levitated, and what it feels like to rise up from the ground and fly. 

These cases show that human levitation is not a matter of speculation; it is a proven and demonstrated fact. The evidence speaks for itself. As amazing and fantastic as it may seem, humans can actually fly up into the air without the aid of any mechanical device. Instead, levitation appears to be a natural human ability, one that manifests under very rare conditions. 

These case are only the tip of the iceberg. In fact, there are more than 330 documented cases of levitation, stretching back thousands of years and coming from many cultures all across our planet.

Can humans fly?

As strange as it sounds, the answer is, yes! Humans do have the ability to levitate and fly through the air without the aid of any device. In fact, there are hundreds of accounts of human levitation on record. Cases reach back thousands of years and come from all across the world.

This video presents the top twenty best verified cases of human levitation. In part one, we cover cases twenty through eleven, each involving a person who has undergone the profound experience of human levitation. While many cases rely solely on the word of the person who experienced it, these accounts are different. These cases not only involve outside witnesses, some of them involve photographic evidence, or were proven in a scientific laboratory setting. These cases prove that humans have super-human abilities that we have only just begun to discover.

What is it like to levitate? How is it done? Can anybody do it? This video (and part two) will answer all these questions and more. Levitation is real! Humans can fly! This is not a matter of speculation or belief. The evidence speaks for itself. The proof is here. And now is the time to rise up, discover who we really are and what we can do. 

And if you think these cases are exciting, just wait for Part Two. The adventure has only just begun!

Would you like to meet extraterrestrials and go onboard their craft? Are you sure?

UFO encounters can be sometimes be traumatic, and they can sometimes be very friendly. Often they can be both scary and enlightening. Initially, many witnesses may find their experiences quite fearful. However, as they overcome their fear and face their encounters head-on, their experiences begin to transform into something much more spiritual and benevolent.

This video presents the story of Pat Brown, who asked to meet ETs and go onboard their ship, and got a little more than she bargained for. Her wish was granted and she began to meet extraterrestrials face-to-face. At first she was terrified, but slowly her encounters began to transform into events both healing and educational. The ETs taught her all about spirituality, and even took her on a tour through outer space.

After years of encounters, she came to realize that the ETs were not trying to harm her or scare her, but in fact were helping her along the spiritual path towards enlightenment. Given the choice, she has elected to keep having encounters and learn all she can from these mysterious visitors to our planet.

What do aliens talk about?

Often ETs seem to be very tight-lipped. The only words they speak are: "Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. Come with us." This is especially true if the witness has a strong reaction of fear. But this is not always the case. In some accounts, people are able to hold long interactive conversations with aliens, during which they learn all about the ETs, who they are, where they come from, and their agenda on Earth.

This video presents four true firsthand accounts of people who were able to talk with the ETs in-depth, carrying on long conversations that reveal many of the questions people have about extraterrestrials. ETs provide all kinds of information, imparting sage advice, revealing details of their home worlds, and even explaining why they contacted the witnesses. They share information about our society and their own, give warnings and predictions, answer any questions the witnesses ask, and so much more.

As a result, many people who first were very fearful of their encounters become transformed, and realize that ET contact can be very benevolent. Being taken onboard a UFO might seem scary, but in fact it is often a truly enlightening and healing experience.

Have you ever seen a UFO? 

A sighting is the most common type of UFO encounter. And each sighting has something important and profound to teach us about the nature and origins of the UFO phenomenon. Often, a close-up sighting brings deeper levels of contact that might not first seem apparent. If someone sees a UFO, the chances are good that the ETs are showing themselves intentionally. Sometimes, what might seem to be a simple sighting is in fact a much more extensive encounter.

This video presents ten different sightings, each of which has something to contribute to our understanding of UFOs and extraterrestrials. A UFO-car chase; an object hovering over a busy airport; a man who has had more than 40 sightings; a saucer hovering directly over powerlines; a small town embroiled in the center of a massive UFO wave; two teen-agers targeted by a massive, fiery object; a family with a close-up encounter that only some remember, a group of objects over a city center viewed by hundreds of people; a mother ship hovering for hours and releasing smaller craft; a UFO that telepathically calls the witness outside to see it -- these sightings show how varied and complex the UFO phenomenon can be.

A UFO sighting has the capacity to totally change a person's life, and alter forever the way they view themselves and the world. Never underestimate the power of UFOs!

UFO healings are now a recognized feature of extraterrestrial encounters. What many people don't know, however, is that there are also several cases on record of animals being healed. The most common category by far is dogs, but other are reports of other animal UFO cures too.

This video presents eight cases of animals who have been healed as the result of a UFO encounter. These cases are important because they not only show a benevolent side to UFOs and aliens; they also show just how truly advanced the ETs are when it comes to healing.

Compared to reports of humans being healed, cases of animal healings are exceedingly rare. That alone makes accounts like these significant. Why are the ETs healing animals? How are they affecting these cures? What does this say about these mysterious visitors to our planet?

Using firsthand eyewitness testimony and actual true-life cases, this video attempts to answer all these questions and more. If you'd like to learn more about animals who have been healed by aliens, please check out my book, "The Healing Power of UFOs: 300 True Accounts."

Just imagine: you’re watching your favorite movie at the local drive-in theater when suddenly you see a strange flying object swoop down from above and hover right over the movie screen. The object is metallic, saucer-shaped, with portholes and colored lights, and is totally silent. It’s a UFO! Cars start honking and flashing their lights. People exit their cars, pointing and screaming. Some drive away in terror. Then the UFO starts to move around over the theater putting on a show that’s far more interesting than the movie itself! 

It may sound like science fiction, except it’s true! This video presents dozens of firsthand cases in which UFOs have targeted drive-in theaters. In these cases, UFOs hover at very low levels for long periods of time, and are observed by hundreds of witnesses. Often there are strange electro-magnetic effects. Sometimes humanoids are seen. 

• ARIZONA, APRIL 1952: A metallic structured object hovers over the Yuma Drive-In Theater in Arizona, not once, but multiple times. 
• CALIFORNIA, AUGUST 1952: Visitors at the Terrace Drive-In undergo an incredible encounter, causing an investigation that reaches the highest levels of government.
• MISSOURI, JULY 17, 1954: Peter Davenport and hundreds of others sight a glowing object at the Skyline Drive-In. Davenport later becomes the director of NUFORC.
• MASSACHUSETTS, MAY 1963: A fleet of eight UFOs appears over the Wellington Circle Twins Drive-In, and puts on a display lasting an incredible 45 minutes long.
• GEORGIA, JUNE 29, 1964: A large metallic saucer swoops repeatedly over the crowded Atlanta Drive-In, causing the audience to flee in panic.
• OHIO, MID-1960s: UFOs swoop so low over the Mentor Drive-In that the movie is shut off so that the audience can enjoy the unexpected bonus show in the sky above.
• KANSAS, 1966: Hundreds of people see a UFO hover directly next to the Southutch Drive-In, causing the entire audience to chase the object down the highway.
• CALIFORNIA, 1972: The audience at the Paramount Drive-In flees in panic as a metallic saucer swoops down and hovers right next to the movie screen.
• FLORIDA, 1973: When a metallic UFO hovers over the Fort Lauderdale Drive-In, the audience is amazed to see strange occupants peering from the portholes.
• NEW YORK, 1974: Viewers at the East Park Drive-In are stunned to see a UFO hover over the parking lot and start sending beams of light onto the movie screen itself!
• OHIO, 1974: A UFO targets the Ascot Park Drive-In, blacking out the movie and causing the entire audience to become hypnotically entranced.
• MAINE, JUNE 15, 1975: A UFO buzzes the audience of the Portland Twin Drive-In Theater, causing the audiences for two separate movies to race away in fear.
• CHINA, JULY 7, 1977: Three hundred people are injured and two are killed when a low-flying UFO targets an open-air showing of a movie to a crowd of 3000 people.
• CALIFORNIA, 1983: The entire audience panics and drives away when a UFO swoops down and hovers right next to the movie screen of the Edgewood Drive-In.
• OHIO, SEPTEMBER 2004: The entire audience observes a UFO which hovers above the Wilmington Drive-In and stays there for the entire length of the movie.

There are too many cases to deny. This area of UFO research has been ignored for too long. Something profound is happening here. This video reveals a bizarre type of UFO behavior that only a lucky few have ever seen. So, come along on a fascinating journey that is sure to change the way you feel about UFOs.

Grays are the most commonly reported type of extraterrestrial. Many of the cases are strikingly similar, however, they also have significant differences. Some are scary and traumatic, while others seem benevolent. This video presents four firsthand cases of different people who have encounters gray aliens.

--Connie, a housewife from Arleta, California sees a gray outside her window, staring at her newborn son.
--Kim, a retired Army vet from Bourbonnais, Illinois, wakes up to see three grays surrounding his bed, telling him to get up and go with them.
--Natalie, a graphic artist from Norway is accosted by three grays in her bedroom, who start to perform an operation on her back.
--Harry, an auto mechanic from Vandalia, Ohio is driving with his wife when they come upon a UFO and two gray aliens hovering above the road.

Four cases involving gray aliens, each with profound similarities and differences. Who are these grays visiting our planet? Why are they here? These four cases provide a little glimpse into the gray agenda and answer some of the questions we have surrounding these mysterious visitors.

When people think of UFO crashes, the Roswell UFO Incident is usually the first to be mentioned. But the truth is, the Roswell UFO crash is only one of hundreds of similar cases involving UFO crash/retrievals. California alone has at least a dozen documented accounts of UFOs that have crashed and been retrieved (and sometimes reverse-engineered) by the United States military.

Several military bases across California have allegedly been involved in UFO crash/retrievals including Edwards Air Force Base, Camp Pendleton, Sunnyvale Naval Air Station, Norton Air Force Base and more. What does our government know, and why are they hiding the truth? If California has more than a dozen cases, how many cases are there?

The time for disclosure is now. If the US government truly has obtained UFOs and alien bodies, they should disclose the truth. This video provides a little glimpse into the history of UFO crash/retrievals in California. More than likely, this is only the tip of iceberg.

In July of 1982, eleven friends went camping at Blackjack Campground in a remote area on Catalina Island, off the coast of southern California. Around sunset a thick fog rolled in. Shortly later, the UFOs arrived. Three unidentified glowing objects approached silently and hovered in front of the witnesses. As the eleven friends struggled to understand what they were seeing, the temperature dropped dramatically. Somebody noticed that their watches had all stopped. Someone else discovered that their flashlights weren't working. Nor were their cameras.

Then the show began. Beams of brilliant light flashed between the objects. Before long, one of the objects released other craft, which soon approached the witnesses.

So begins an encounter which would change the lives of eleven people forever. It's a multiple witness UFO encounter involving multiple strange effects both electromagnetic and physiological.

Catalina Island is located in a UFO hotspot. Many other encounters have occurred on the Island and in the surrounding area. The UFO encounter at Blackjack Campground is one of nearly 150 cases involving UFO and "USOs," unidentified submersible objects.

It's unfortunate, but it's true. Many people have lost their job as the result of a UFO encounter. If word gets out that you have seen a UFO, or that you believe you have been taken onboard a craft, or even if you are merely interested in the subject, sorry -- you're fired! You are now unemployed. Pack your personal belongings. Your final check is in the mail.

Discrimination against UFO experiencers and investigators is a real problem in society. Experiencing a UFO encounter can be traumatic. But then witnesses sometimes have to deal with the additional trauma of being disbelieved or ridiculed, or actually losing their livelihood.

This problem is particularly acute among the police, whose job it is to watch out for anything unusual. And yet when they report something very unusual, what happens?...They're fired.

This video presents more than a dozen firsthand cases of people who were terminated from their place of employment for talking about UFOs. Police, doctors, pilots, politicians  -- all have had their careers destroyed by getting too close to UFOs. And it's the denial of our own governments to admit the reality of UFOs that has caused this appalling situation.

The time is now for truth and transparency on the subject of UFOs. If you would like to explore more about these cases and others, check out my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three."

Angel  Hair: it's a mysterious cobweb-like substance being ejected from UFOs. Despite countless numbers of UFO encounters, reports of Angel Hair are exceedingly rare. But in a handful of UFO sightings, this mysterious material drifts down from the sky like cotton candy, covering trees, bushes, fields, homes, cars, telephone wires...everywhere.

This video presents more than twenty UFO events involving Angel Hair. Some of the cases include:

1952: Oloron, France. A large mother ship and thirty UFOs blanket the town with huge volumes of a stringy white substance.
1953: San Fernando Valley, CA. Jets chase a silver sphere, which ejects enough Angel Hair to cover a two block area.
1954:  Tuscany, Italy. A football game with 10,000 fans is interrupted by UFOs which swoop down and release a glittering, white, flaky substance over the crowd.
1954: Marysville, OH. More than 60 students and teachers at Jerome Elementary see a UFO which covers not only the entire school, but a six-mile radius around them.
1955. Whitsett, NC. More than 120 students and teachers at Whitsett Elementary experience a dramatic UFO display involving enormous quantities of what looks like cotton candy. One student even tries to eat it!

And this is just the beginning. Cases reach back many years and continue to occur today. 

In most cases, Angel Hair dissolves and evaporates in minutes, or upon contact. In a few cases, however, there are immense quantities of the stuff, and eyewitnesses are able to preserve precious samples. In a few rare cases, Angel Hair has been subjected to scientific analysis. And the results are astonishing. 

What is angel hair? What is it made of? Why is it being ejected from UFOs? Is this just the "exhaust" from flying saucer engines? Is this material being intentionally ejected? Most importantly, what is it made of?

This video presents the evidence as we know it so far. Angel Hair is important because it is tangible, physical evidence of the existence of UFOs. Read more about these cases and more in my book, "Not from Here: Volume 2."

Physiological effects as the result of a UFO encounter are very rare, and yet they do happen. Following a close-up UFO encounter, people sometimes experience dry or sore eyes, eye irritation, burns or inflammation, after-images on the retina or light sensitivity. Less common, but equally consistent, are cases of physiological improvements. Among the most common of both are accounts involving the eyes.

This video presents twenty firsthand cases of people who have experienced ocular improvements in association with a UFO encounter. Imagine being color blind, and then you have a strange visitation and are able to see colors for the first time. Imagine being diagnosed with glaucoma, and then finding help greeting you from beyond the stars. What if you lost your vision, and afterward, someone unique and unexpected arrived in your time of need? Or what if you were visited by ETs, and now suddenly you start having psychic visions?

Could the UFO occupants be here to help us? Sometimes the answer might be, yes! The evidence shows that something profound is happening here.

Many researchers have studied and remarked upon the obvious similarities between modern day UFO accounts and stories in the Bible and about Jesus. Some have come to the belief that Jesus may have actually been an extraterrestrial.  Much of the research into this area has focused on ancient and historical accounts, including many paintings throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance which portray Jesus and UFOs in the same scene.

This video, however, focuses on current firsthand UFO accounts which contain overtly religious elements. The fact is, there are several recent cases on record in which people have reported seeing Jesus or other religious figures onboard a UFO! Investigators call these "mixed motif" cases, encounters which contain both extraterrestrial and religious themes. While these cases seem to be very rare, there are enough to raise serious questions about UFO origins and the connections between ETs, angels, demons and humanity itself.

Are UFOs angelic in origin? Could they be demonic? Are we dealing with a powerful interdimensional intelligence that shapeshifts and wears different masks? Or can these accounts be explained as extraterrestrials in the classic sense?

Whatever the explanation, these mixed motif cases defy the standard model of UFO contact, and may contain important insights into the nature of the phenomenon.

Most UFO encounters don't involve Bigfoot. And most Bigfoot encounters don't involve UFOs. But in a growing number of cases, these two seemingly separate phenomena perfectly intersect. There are now dozens of cases on record in which people have seen Bigfoot and UFOs at the same time, in the same place. In some instances, people report seeing Bigfoot entering or exiting extraterrestrial craft. And in a few, people say they have seen Bigfoot onboard a UFO.

As strange as this sounds, this weird confluence is well-known among UFO researchers, many who have cases to contribute. But wait, there's more! Some of the cases involve other strange events, such as poltergeist activity or telepathic contact with Bigfoot.

What is going on here? Is Bigfoot an alien? What exactly is the connection between Bigfoot and UFOs?

This video presents a wide variety of firsthand cases which illustrate the many strange connections between Bigfoot, UFOs and other paranormal phenomenon.

<p>Catalina Island, located off the southern California Coast, is the central focus of a 
huge amount of UFO and USO (unidentified submersible objects) activity. The cases in 
this area reach back more than 100 years and are still occurring today. Among the 
strangest and most dramatic are several cases of UFOs seen by groups of boy scouts and 
camp directors.</p>

<p>This video presents three incredible cases in which UFOs have put on a display for a 
large group of boy scouts and adults on Catalina Island.</p>

<p>In 1952, an encounter at Camp Fox, Catalina Island was viewed by 350 witnesses and 
reached the highest levels of military intelligence.</p>

<p>In 1992, a group of boy scouts and directors at Camp Cherry Valley, Catalina Island 
observed a dramatic display involving an object darting around, spinning, and sending 
down beams of light.</p>

<p>In 2013, boy scouts and camp directors from Emerald Cove Boy Scout Camp observed a 
fantastic two-hour long display involving more than 200 objects of many different 
shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>These incredible cases provide some unique insights into the UFO activity in this 
area, and into the nature of the phenomenon itself. For those who would like to hear

<p>In 1960, a 21-year-old young man named Jim, joined the Navy and was stationed aboard 
the US Navy aircraft carrier, USS Valley Forge as an electronics specialist and a 
helicopter crew member of the HS-3 Hunter Killer antisubmarine squadron. While 
returning from the Mediterranean Sea to the United States, Jim and at least ten other 
crew members observed multiple unidentified glowing objects, UFOs, off the starboard 
bow of their ship. The objects remained in view for nearly an hour, beginning a mystery 
that would leave a trail of unanswered questions.</p>

<p>Jim soon learned two things. First, there was an apparent coverup of the event. Second, 
this incident was not just a simple sighting, but involved direct contact, perhaps actual 
onboard UFO encounters. In fact, he himself had memories he couldn't explain.</p>

<p>This video presents one man's amazing story about his participation in a multiple 
witness UFO incident on the USS Valley Forge, and how he came to realize that his 
sighting might actually involve an onboard encounter and face to face contact with ETs. 
Jim had a long conversation with the UFO people, and was given a profound and important 
message for all humankind, one which would have a profound impact on his entire life.</p>

<p>UFOs are not just a nuts and bolts phenomenon. There is also a strong spiritual aspect 
to extraterrestrial encounters. In fact, a wide variety of paranormal events surround 
UFOs. A close encounter often has a huge impact on a person, challenging them on multiple 
levels, physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It's very clear that UFOs 
have a powerful connection to human consciousness and spirituality.</p>

<p>This video presents seven firsthand UFO cases in which spirituality played a profound 
role. Spirit quests, meditation, ghostly visitations, dreams, premonitions, OBEs, 
channeling, psychic healing...all of these are part of the UFO phenomenon. Over and 
over again, people who have close encounters find themselves spiritually transformed.</p>

<p>What exactly is the connection between UFOs and the paranormal? While the answers 
remain elusive, these cases show that this connection manifests in a wide variety of 
ways.</p>

<p>The man who climbs a mountain to overcome an internal struggle is greeted by a UFO. 
A lady tired of the world retreats to the wilderness to find herself instead confronted 
with something otherworldly. Two young ladies struggle with an angry poltergeist only to 
find that something else even more bizarre has also arrived for a visit. These and other 
astounding cases will show you how truly strange the UFO experience can be.</p>

<p>UFOs appear to represent a very advanced technology. The extraterrestrial craft can 
move at dazzling speeds, turn at right angles, change into various shapes and even turn 
invisible. Another incredible talent of UFOs and extraterrestrials is their miraculous 
ability to change their size. They can make not only make themselves and their ships 
large or small, but they can also do this to human beings.</p>

<p>This video features twenty UFO cases in which extraterrestrials display their 
seemingly magical technology, causing bizarre spatial anomalies of many kinds. UFOs 
that are bigger on the inside than the outside, miniature UFOs with tiny aliens, 
people who are struck by mysterious UFO beams of light that cause them to shrink 
or grow in size -- something very strange is happening here. The ETs' ability to 
manipulate space and time is undeniable.</p>

<p>UFOs have often been seen over nuclear power stations, nuclear missile sites, and 
anything associated with nuclear energy. In 1971, the USS Clamagore, a Navy submarine 
equipped with nuclear torpedoes, encountered  a UFO, or actually a USO (an unidentified 
submersible object) which approached the sub and paced it for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>This incredible encounter is only one of many, many instances in which UFOs and USOs 
have been encountered by the US Navy. This video presents the UFO Incident on the USS 
Clamagore, as well as four other incredible UFO/USO encounters by Navy and other 
military personnel.  Some of these encounters include a sighting by the crew of the 
USS Long Beach (a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser,) a fascinating USO sighting 
by two retired Navy submariners near San Simeon, California, a highly dramatic USO 
sighting witnessed by dozens of people off the coast of Redondo Beach, California, 
and finally a visitation by a fleet of glowing donut-shaped USOs by a US Coast Guard 
Captain off the coast of Haiti.</p>

<p>In some cases, these UFO events went unrecorded or were actively covered up. This 
raises the question, how often does our Navy encounter UFOs and USOs and never reveal 
it? As these cases shows, perhaps more than you might think!</p>

<p>Until recently, there has been very little research into USOs. And yet, if these and 
other cases are true, then our oceans could be swarming with large numbers of alien 
craft, most of which remain unseen by human eyes.</p>

<p>It is time for disclosure of all UFO information. These incidents and others should 
be known by everyone! If you would like to learn more about these and other remarkable 
USO encounters, please check out my book, "Undersea UFO Base," available on Amazon.</p>

<p>There are many very strange procedures that occur during onboard UFO encounters, but 
one that has been given more than its fair share of attention is the alien anal probe. It 
has become the butt of jokes on the internet. It has saturated nearly every aspect of our 
culture. The media has targeted this one particular procedure to a degree that it has 
come to define the UFO abduction experience in its entirety.</p>

<p>While many people have joked about the alien anal probe, the truth is, it is very 
serious, especially to those on the receiving end. This video presents a deeper look 
into this bizarre phenomenon, and provides an in-depth analysis. It shows how the 
media has focused on this one particular aspect of the UFO experience above all 
others. It also presents firsthand cases from leading UFO researchers and the 
experiencers themselves.</p>

<p>Why are ETs flying light years to examine the anuses of innocent humans? What is the 
purpose behind this extraordinary extraterrestrial excremental experimentation?</p>

<p>This video answers all these questions and more. For those who would like to learn 
more about these cases and others, please check out my book, "Not from Here: Volume 
Three."</p>

<p>All across the world, people are experiencing onboard UFO encounters. This is the 
story of two young brothers who were abducted into a UFO in 1978 from their home in a 
quiet suburb in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>This is an important case because the main witness, Andy, recalls his experience 
consciously without the use of hypnosis, and is able to provide a clear description 
of the interior of the craft. Also, it's a multiple witness case with many interesting 
and unusual details, including a weird encounter with a "USO," an unidentified 
submersible object.</p>

<p>Andy was only twelve years old when his bedroom filled with light and he found himself 
taken into a UFO. Now, many years later, he has bravely stepped forward and allowed his 
incredible story to be told.</p>

<p>Most UFO investigators today agree that UFO abductions are a real phenomenon. They 
still represent the cutting edge of UFO research, and provide the most opportunity to 
learn about these strange visitors to our planet.</p>

<p>If you would like to read more about Andy's abduction, or other people who have been 
taken onboard a UFO, check out my book, "Onboard UFO Encounters," available on Amazon.</p>

Sometimes UFO encounters are shrouded in a weird forgetfulness. Amnesia is a very real problem when dealing with extraterrestrials. Many encounters occur, but the witnesses forget about them. This video presents three incredible UFO encounters during which the witnesses experienced amnesia and other weird amnesia-like effects.

"The Case of the Glowing Egg." Hearing about recent sightings in their area, three teen-age boys go out UFO hunting and get more than they bargain for when a strange egg-shaped craft shows up, confronting them face-to-face.

"Beamed by a UFO." Nineteen-year-old "Jay" and his friend hear about a nearby farm that is being visited by UFOs. They decide to investigate, causing a series of UFO encounters that will change Jay's life forever.

"Five Hours Onboard a UFO." Starting at age twelve, "Jack" experiences a series of bizarre events, all of which remained unexplained. Then 25 years later, a weird accident occurs which causes Jack to remember everything.

Three cases of close encounters, each involving profound forgetfulness and missing time. How can an event as amazing as UFO contact be totally forgotten? As these cases show, the ETs seem to do it with perfect ease. This raises the question, how many people have been taken onboard a UFO and don't remember anything? 

For those who'd like to learn more about UFO encounters, these three cases and others are presented in detail in my book, "Extraterrestrial Visitations: True Accounts of Contact."

On the weekend of March 26-27, 1994, the Triad UFO Conference (funded by billionaire Robert Bigelow) was held at the Del Coronado Hotel on Coronado Island in southern California. Featured were leading abduction investigators Budd Hopkins, Yvonne Smith, John Carpenter and others. Several hundred people attended the conference.

Mike Evans, his wife, and a small group of other friends decided to attend. Unknown to them, they were about to become embroiled in one of the strangest and most unique events in UFO history: a mass UFO abduction. Six witnesses in three adjoining hotel rooms at the Village Inn all experienced an alien encounter on the same evening. Meanwhile, conference attendees at other nearby hotels also experienced extraterrestrial visitations.

Coronado Island is a small, densely populated island, much of which is owned and used by the United States Navy. It's a popular tourist destination, heavily guarded by police and military personnel. In other words, an unlikely location for a mass UFO abduction.

But wait, there's more! At the time of the abduction, the presidential Secret Service swarmed the island. President Clinton was visiting the next day. He planned to stay at the home of Larry Lawrence, US Ambassador to Switzerland, owner of the Hotel Del Coronado and one of the wealthiest men in the United States. Lawrence was a huge donor to President Clinton's campaign. And by some strange coincidence, the home of Larry Lawrence and the Village Inn were separated by only a few thousand feet.

Another thing that makes this case different is many of the witnesses suffered alarming physical symptoms following this encounter and others. One of the witnesses discovered an apparent alien implant in her leg, which was subsequently removed by Dr. Roger Leir, providing incontrovertible evidence of extraterrestrial intervention. 

This video presents the Coronado Island UFO Incident from beginning to end, as told by one of the main percipients. Yvonne Smith's excellent book, "Coronado," tells the comprehensive story of this case, with several more new witnesses. You can also read about the experiences of the six experiencers at the Village Inn in my book, "The Coronado Island Incident," co-written by Mike Evans.

Alien clowns! It may sound bizarre, but it's true. People are being visited by aliens dressed up as clowns! Several researchers have reported cases like these. Extraterrestrials are not only dressing up as clowns, but in other strange outfits, such as cowboy costumes or old-fashioned tuxedos and pin-stripe suits. Sometimes they even come wearing wigs or toupees!

Are these screen memories? Are the aliens actually wearing these clothes? What is the purpose behind this strange behavior? If they are trying to reduce the fear factor, it's not working very well! Fear of clowns is so common, it has its own name: coulrophobia. Could the ETs responsible for this widespread fear of clowns?

This video presents true firsthand cases from people across the world who have encountered aliens dressed up as clowns or other characters. It also provides some insights into why this might be happening.

Some UFO encounters are scary. Some are friendly. And some UFO encounters actually save people's lives. In case after case, people report that ETs have intervened to rescue them from dangerous situations such as car accidents, drownings, assault, natural disasters and more.

Trapped on a sinking boat, caught in quicksand, lost on an unfamiliar highway, suffering from poverty, about to experience a seemingly unavoidable collision, in danger of being overwhelmed by a hurricane...ETs suddenly show up and rescue people right when they need it most.

Are ETs truly here to help people? Are they our friends? As these twenty cases show, sometimes the answer is yes! These cases reveal a benevolent side to the UFO phenomenon that deserves more attention. ETs are not only healing people, they are saving their lives. Talk about friends in high places!

UFOs are being seen all over our planet. But there is one specific type of location that is attracting large numbers of UFOs: mines! UFOs are targeting our mines. Gold mines, silver mines, iron mines, copper mines, titanium mines, uranium mines and more: all are being visited by UFOs. 

UFOs are not only hovering over mines, they are also landing. Humanoids are being seen. In some cases, the mines are being physically affected. Photographs have been taken. Some mines have been targeted over and over again. Cases come from across the United States, Canada, Central and South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, Australia and more.

This video presents more than 50 cases involving extraterrestrials miners. These include close encounters of the first, second and third kinds. Clearly, something very profound is happening here!

These cases have much to teach us about these strange visitors to our planet. For those interested in learning more about these extraordinary encounters, check out the book, "Not from Here: Volume One."

Alien Zoos!

ETs have been studying our planet for a very long time. They seem to be interested in all things Earth. They have taken humans onboard their craft. They have collected a wide variety of plants. And they are also taking animals. In fact, there are several cases on record in which experiencers have seen collections of live animals onboard UFOs. This video is not about animal mutilations; it's about something much more bizarre. As strange as it sounds, some abductees report being taken to visit alien zoos, containing animals from Earth, and also animals from other planets. Some UFOs, it seems, are very much like "Noah's Ark," preserving a wide variety of species. 

Some of these cases have a very high level of strangeness, including chimera-like creatures from ancient mythology, or even in a few cases, dinosaur-like creatures.

The ETs' interest in animals is also betrayed by the many cases in which UFOs and extraterrestrials have been caught taking animals of all kinds. Farm animals seem to be a primary target, but a wide variety of animals have been abducted into UFOs.

In a few cases, ETs seem to be particularly interested in our closest animal companions, dogs and cats. One case contains a shocking revelation explaining why they have such a strong interest in our pets.

Alien zoos may sound strange, but there are too many cases to ignore. Something very strange is happening here.

ETs are abducting people and collecting their genetic material. They are abducting animals. And they are also abducting plants! As these accounts will show, ETs have been collecting a wide variety of plants for a very long time.

And that's not all. If you are taken onboard a UFO, the last thing you might expect to see is a forest. And yet, this has happened more than you might think. 

And the cases get even stranger. In some cases, ETs  provide advice about gardening. In others, they use more direct methods. Imagine a UFO shines down and causes a plant to double in size. There's more than one case like it!

Why are ETs collecting plants and growing forests onboard UFOs? What is the motive behind this agenda? ETs have been warning people about Earth changes for many years. Perhaps they have decided to take action themselves. Could UFOs be like Noah's Ark, trying to save the species of our planet? 

Only one thing is for sure: ETs are here, and they are taking our plants.

In the first week of November 1957, a series of dramatic and unusual UFO events occurred which caused great concern at the highest levels of government and changed the way many people viewed the UFO phenomenon. Sputnik 1 had been launched one month earlier, and the launch of Sputnik 2 was imminent. Then, in the first week of November 1957, a dramatic wave of UFO encounters struck the states of Texas and New Mexico. The apparent primary target was a small town called Levelland.

What happened in Levelland, Texas was unprecedented and had never occurred before, and has yet to be repeated. Dozens of people in Levelland and the surrounding areas reported UFOs disabling their vehicles, causing the electrical system to fail and the car engines to cease functioning. In case after case, UFOs buzzed cars at low level, and often landed on the road, blocking their way forward. UFO car-stalling cases were well-known among UFO researchers, but this brazen and audacious level of activity had never been reported before. 

While the small town of Levelland, Texas and the surrounding area first appeared to be the target, the truth was much different. In fact, similar and often identical encounters occurred across the United States and the world, involving not only car-stalling cases, but many bizarre electromagnetic effects on a wide variety of machines.

UFO researchers had long known that UFOs cause these strange effects, but had considered them an accidental byproduct of close-up UFO sightings. But after what happened in Levelland, questions began to be raised. Perhaps these effects weren't accidental at all. Perhaps they  were intentional.

The U.S. government and Project Blue Book officials first attempted to debunk and cover-up the events, claiming that sightings were nothing more than "ball lightning," while at the same time, warning military and civilian witnesses not to speak to the press. 

But it wasn't ball lightning. The sightings were too dramatic to ignore, and soon garnered national headlines. The Levelland UFO encounters have never been explained and remain a mystery to this day. Nothing like them has ever occurred before or since. 

This amazing event was easily the most famous UFO event of the year, and is well known among researchers. However, what many people don't know is just how numerous, dramatic and widespread the encounters actually were, or the consequences that followed. This video presents a minute-by-minute account of this incredible week in November 1952. The questions as to why, however, have yet to be answered.

If you enjoyed this video, you might also enjoy the book, "UFOs over New Mexico," which provides a partial accounting of these truly incredible events. Available on Amazon.

Ever since the Modern Age of UFOs began in 1947, UFOs have been closely monitoring humanity's progress into space. When the U.S. military began to actively launch missiles at White Sands in New Mexico, UFOs immediately made their presence known, not only following the missiles in full view, but sometimes intervening to cause the missiles to fall to Earth. When more rocket launches occurred, UFOs were often there. Wherever rockets were being launched, UFOs showed up, including not only White Sands, but China Lake, Vandenburg, Holloman and other areas. While the U.S. military scrambled to deal with the sudden UFO presence, at the same time they aggressively tried to cover-up the events. 

But as the UFOs continued to show themselves, still sometimes disabling the rockets, whistle-blowers recognized the importance of what was happening and courageously alerted the public of what was happening.

These are not simple sighting. Under the J. Allen Hynek system, some might be classified as Close Encounters of the Second Kind, during which UFOs affect the environment (disabling a missile.) But in actuality, they are all human-initiated encounters and are more accurately classified as CE5 events.

This video presents about twenty cases in which UFOs have showed up during rocket launches. As most of these events have been covered up, the actual number is certainly much higher.

The incredible events that have occurred at White Sands, Holloman AFB, China Lake, Vandenburg AFB and other areas have yet to be fully revealed. 

As this video will show, the UFO occupants' interest and monitoring of rocket launches is likely comprehensive, as there are cases in which UFOs have shown up during the launching of toy model rockets! Some UFO abductees have been told directly that we are being observed.

Why are UFOs monitoring and disabling missiles? What happened to all the camera footage showing these events? How many times has this happened? We all deserve to know the truth about the UFO presence on our planet. Cases like these are profoundly important and can be ignored no longer.

For those who would like to learn more, I have documented these (and other) cases in my book, "Not from Here: Volume Two," now available on Amazon.

There are more than 300 UFO healing cases on record. Some cases, however, rise above the rest. This video presents 20 of the very best UFO healing cases. These well-documented accounts come from men and women across the world, and involve the healings of a wide variety of injuries, illnesses and diseases. Many of the cases have been verified by doctors and UFO researchers. These UFO healing events are important because they present hard physical evidence of extraterrestrial intervention in people's lives. They also have many things to teach us about these mysterious visitors to our planet. They show us that there is no such thing as a chronic or incurable disease. They also show a very positive side to ETs and their agenda on Earth.

UFOs are hovering over prisons!
UFOs are known to be attracted to technological installations such as power stations, military bases and more, including, evidently, prisons. These are not coincidental  fly-bys. In these cases prisons are being directly targeted. The objects hover at very low levels for long periods of time. They are often viewed by both prison officials and inmates.

There are more than 20 cases on record. These are not simple sightings, but also include physiological effects and strange electromagnetic effects. In a few cases, photographs have been taken. There's at least one case of a landing. Humanoids have been seen, and there's even an apparent abduction. Clearly something very profound is happening here!

San Quentin Prison, Lebanon Correctional Institute, Colorado State Penitentiary and many 
others have all had encounters. Some locations have been visited repeatedly. The question, 
of course, is why? After watching this presentation, you will know the answer.

For those who are interested in learning more about UFOs over prisons, I collected many of 
these cases in chapter six of my book, "Not from Here: Volume Three," now available on Amazon.

On the evening of June 14, 1992, a massive UFO wave occurred over the small community of 
Topanga Canyon, California. Hundreds of UFOs were seen by multiple witnesses across the 
canyon. Objects hovered over homes, shot across the sky, chased cars down the road, even 
lifting one up in the sky. But the full story has never been told. Until now. This video 
presents brand new startling information about this famous case, including excerpts from 
phone calls made to the police, new eyewitnesses, photographs and more, including an 
apparent abduction.

On this evening, numerous people called the police, the local newspaper, and UFO groups. 
In this video, you will hear the police tape firsthand, and listen to actual witnesses 
reporting the incredible events which occurred on that evening. The night of June 14, 
1992 remains one of the most incredible UFO events in California history, and marked the 
beginning of a two-year-long UFO wave of stupendous proportions.

Are you ready to go swimming inside a UFO?
It's among the strangest of events that occur to abductees when they are taken onboard an 
extraterrestrial craft. They are placed in an aquarium-like tank and made to breathe a 
thick gelatinous liquid. Many researchers have investigated cases like these: David 
Jacobs, Barbara Lamb, Yvonne Smith and others. While there are several theories, the 
exact purposes of the UFO breathing pool remain unknown.

This video presents more than a dozen cases of abductees who have experienced the UFO 
breathing pool. What is it like to be placed in this liquid?  What kind of liquid is it? 
How are people able to breathe in this liquid and still survive? There are now enough 
documented cases to provide a clear picture of this unique procedure and the reasons

If an extraterrestrial handed you a glass of strange liquid and said, "Drink this," would 
you drink it?

It's one of the stranger and more unusual experiences that people have when taken onboard 
a UFO. They are given alien drinks, weird glowing liquids, and are told to drink them. 
What are the contents of these extraterrestrial beverages? What do they taste like? What 
is the purpose behind them? 

This video presents 15 cases in which abductees were given alien drinks. There aren't a 
lot of cases, but there are enough to provide some insights and answers into this unique 
and bizarre aspect of UFO abductions.

For those who'd like to learn more, I present these cases in detail in my book, "Not from 
Here: Volume Two," now available on Amazon.

In Part One of this presentation,  dozens of cases of UFOs hovering over schools were 
presented. Now, in Part Two, we explore the more exciting cases involving landings and 
humanoids. There are five very famous incidents of UFOs landing next to schools:

    1. Ariel Elementary School, Ruwa, Zimbabwe.
    2. Broad Haven Primary School, Wales.
    3. Crestview Elementary School, Opa-Locka, Florida.
    4. Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, Michigan.
    5. Westall High School, Melbourne, Australia.

What many people don't know is that these five cases are just the tip of the iceberg. 
There are at least 40 documented accounts of UFOs landing next to schools. Often 
humanoids are seen. In some cases, messages are given. In a few cases, children are 
abducted. Government coverups, landing trace evidence, medical effects and more. The 
cases reach back more than 100 years and come from all over the world.  Something very 
profound is happening here!

This video presents the cases chronologically, as they happened.

Why are UFOs hovering over and landing next to schools? What kinds of messages have 
people received? What exactly is the purpose behind this agenda? This video will 
answer all these questions and more.

If you are interested in learning more about these kinds of cases, please check out 
the book, "Schoolyard UFO Encounters," now available on Amazon.

All across the world, schools are being targeted by UFOs. More than 100 documented cases 
are on record. These are typically long lasting, low level, daylight encounters viewed by 
large groups of witnesses. Something very profound is happening here.

This video is Part One of a two-part presentation on the history of schoolyard UFO 
encounters on our planet. Why are UFOs targeting schools? What happens when a UFO hovers 
over a school playground and is viewed by hundreds of witnesses, including teachers? 

The cases shown here will answer these questions and more. 

Part One covers dozens of sightings, starting as early as 1853 and continuing to the 
present day. There are cases of UFOs hovering at extremely low levels, sometimes causing 
panic on the playground. There are cases involving photographs and moving films. Two 
cases involve physical evidence in the form of angel hair. In some cases, there is a 
strong government response.

And this is just the beginning! While the sightings are amazing enough, even more 
astonishing are the many cases of landings and humanoids.  Part Two of this 
presentation: "Schoolyard UFO Encounters Part Two: Landings and Humanoids," covers 
the cases of actual contact, revealing the truth behind the alien agenda of 
targeting schools.

All these cases and more have been collected in my book, "Schoolyard UFO Encounters: 100 
True Accounts," now available on Amazon.

It's one of the rarest types of UFO encounters: cases in which people are given alien 
artifacts by the ETs. There are a surprising number of cases coming from across the 
planet. Crystals, metal bars, food, medicine, books, mechanical devices...all have 
been given to abductees by alien beings. What happens when somebody is given an 
actual alien artifact? The results may surprise you.

This video presents nearly a dozen cases in which people were given alien artifacts.

It's one of the strangest types of UFO behavior, and kind of creepy. UFOs are hovering 
over graveyards and cemeteries, usually at very low levels. In some cases, they land and 
humanoids are seen. In other cases, graves are being disturbed. Clearly something very 
profound is happening here. 
In this video I present about a dozen cases coming from major researchers across the 
world. UFOs are definitely attracted to graveyards. The question is: why?

When people are taken onboard a UFO, they are often taken to the control room and told 
how the craft works, or are even put in the control seat and allowed to fly the craft 
themselves. In even rarer cases, the ETs provide specific instructions about how to 
build a UFO engine. This video presents almost a dozen cases in which ETs teach people 
how to build an electromagnetic motor. Some of the people have made remarkable progress. 
The results may surprise you.
If you'd like to know more, the dozen cases featured in this video are all presented in

<p>Have you ever received a phone call from an ET? As fantastic as it sounds, some people 
have. UFO contact comes in many different forms, including by telephone. In this video I 
present several cases in which people have held telephone conversations with 
extraterrestrials. For more info, see my book, "Not from Here: Vol 1."</p>

<h6>TRANSCRIPT</h6>
<h6>Introduction</h6>
hello everyone my name is Preston Dennett and  today I'd like to like to talk to you a little  
bit about my book not from here Volume one which  is about the more unusual and lesser-known aspects  
of the UFO phenomenon and today I want to talk  about my favorite chapter chapter 2 which is  
called phone call from an alien and yeah I know  how that sounds but the fact is there are now  

<h6>Jack Sarfatti</h6>
a number of cases on record in which people  have received phone calls from apparent ETS
probably one of the better cases is that involving  a physicist a quantum physicist by the name of  
Jack Sarfatti he's a pioneering quantum physicist  he's championed Bell's Theorem and claims that sub  
atomic particles are connected non-locally which  has turned out to be true but when mr. Sarfati  
was about 12 or 13 years old he received what was  apparently a phone call from an et he heard this  
mechanical sounding voice that asked him if he  wanted to learn from him and Sarfatti said yes  
sure and he expected to have a physical contact  and gathered all his friends and hoping the UFO  
would show up and it never did and that's all he  really remembers except his mom says no that's  
not exactly what happened according to her memory  the phone calls continued her son would take them  
and he started to act very strangely talking  about these very highly scientific and exotic  
topics and she became very concerned and the  next time the phone rang she took it from him  
said don't call here anymore and that's when  the calls stopped but a Sarfati has told this  
story publicly and it's only one of many in which  people have received apparent phone calls from ETS
another really well-known case would be that of  Debby Jordan who is the star client and by the  

<h6>Debby Jordan</h6>
hopkins book intruders she went by the pseudonym  Debbie Kathy Davis but she has since come out  
publicly about her abductions with great type ETS  I would have lesser known about her experiences is  
that she received a bunch of weird phone calls  apparently from ETS this began in 1980 when she  
was pregnant Debbie began to receive the series of  phone calls it was always on a Wednesday and she  
would hear these strange noises hums and clicks  and beeps and occasionally these voices speaking  
of strange seemingly alien language the calls  continued for about nine months then suddenly  
stopped after she had her child after her child  was born the calls no longer continued but when  
the child grew up and began to speak he began  to speak in words that reminded Debbie Tartan  
of the language she heard on the phone while she  was pregnant with him so I'm not really concerned  

<h6>Betty Andreasen</h6>
her I'm thankfully the child grew out of it oh  definitely there seems to be a connection there  
and uh not the only case like this Raymond  Fowler a very well-known investigator ran  
into this sort of case phone call from an alien  when you began working with Betty Andreasen an  
abductee from Massachusetts and daily Andreasen  in 1977 was talking with her then-boyfriend Bob  
Lucca when an ET broke in on the conversation in  an angry voice and she actually heard the words  
it's finished it is done this wasn't the only  time she had calls like this she would often  
hear these voices sometimes they did sound angry  sometimes not but often they'd be speaking what  
sounded like a foreign language with kind of lots  of ELLs and T's in it so yeah this is apparently  

<h6>Whitley Strieber</h6>
<p>A thing who knew whitley strieber talks about  something similar that happened to him where  
he was with his wife this is around April of  1977 and suddenly this stereo started talking  
to them and they held a brief conversation  with the voice over the stereo which should  
be impossible it's got no transmitter he actually  members the blast line of the conversation was the  
smell boy saying I know something else about you  so yeah clearly these cases are not I mean they  

<h6>Harold Wilkins</h6>
<p>It may be unusual but they're not unheard of. Harold Wilkins, a pioneering UFO researcher, revealed  
several cases in which strange voices had come over radios. John Peel, another early pioneering 
researcher, said "oh, this happened many times" and he received calls like this with strange  
clicks and beeps. He says it was not unusual during a UFO flap, where this sort of thing would  
happen. Over radios and even televisions. I know another case in which a gentleman saw seven UFO. As 
he counted them very carefully and raced off, his phone rang. He didn't answer it, but when he looked  
at it to see who had called, the personal number that it showed was all sevens. Sevens which 
he felt were a message from the 80s and certainly very unusual. Not a bell number. So I'm not sure 
what to make of these cases.</p>

<h6>Donald Kehoe</h6>
<p>Donald is a pioneering researcher. He talked about this as  
well. He said that he talked to fighter pilots. He said that it was clear to them that the UFOs 
were listening in on radio conversations. And I have run into cases of this myself. A couple of 
New York abductee times. Probably the most dramatic is a case that I included in my latest book 
"Inside UFOs" - and it occurred to a New York abductee named Kenneth. He has had abductions his 
whole life. A lot of experiences. When he was down in Florida where he lived for a while, he 
started receiving these strange phone calls. It's very much like Betty Andreasen and Debbie Jordan 
described it. Always come on the same day and usually it was just a dead phone or he'd hear strange 
noises but one time he's back up in New York and he's driving along and his phone starts ringing
he looked. Except it's ringing in a weird tone that he's never heard before. The phone normally does 
not make us not it's normal ringer. He looks at the readout and it says it's no number or the lines 
just dead so he doesn't answer it. Then it rings again. He looks down and says no number he answers 
it and he hears these weird clicks and noises and this voice starts talking and suddenly it says 
the time has grown closer and shortly after that is UFO showed up and the ET's showed up and he had 
what was perhaps the most profound abduction in his life. He was fully conscious as the ETS told him 
why they had been abducting him this whole time. So it's clear that these cases are widespread 
they've been a occurring for a long time and continue to occur. As unusual 
as they  sound it really fits right into the spectrum  
of UFO contact. UFOs are well-known for affecting all kinds of electromagnetic instruments including 
automobiles, lights, radios, &amp; televisions. So, it should be a surprise that Bay and effect 
phones as well. Perhaps this is why they're seen so many times over high high tension wires, telephone  
wires. Just a theory. All we really know is that these cases are taking place and will probably  
continue to take place. So, next time the phone rings, who knows it might just be an ET calling you.</p>

<h6>TRANSCRIPT</h6>
<p class="tallFirstLetter">In this video, I describe all ten cases in my book, "Inside UFOs." A paperboy meets a 
green-skinned ET, a teacher meets a friendly Nordic, a Navy medic meets a 15-foot-talls 
Praying Mantis, a housewife meets a 12-foot tall humanoids and more. The aliens have 
arrived!</p>

<h6>Intro</h6>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Preston Dennett and I'm pleased to announce that my latest 
book "Inside UFOs" has been released. It presents 10 all new cases of people who have had 
extensive contact with UFOs. We're gonna try and get through  all 10 cases in less than 
three minutes.</p>

<h6>Chapter 1: Kevin</h6>
<p>The first chapter is about a man named Kevin. A Navy corpsman who is invited aboard 
UFO where he met 15-foot tall praying mantises who took him  on a time travel trip it's 
an extraordinary case.</p>

<h6>Chapter 2: Tyler</h6>
<p>Is about a gentleman I call Taylor. He's now a doctor he was a little boy his  
mom sent him out to mail a letter and he instead had contact with friendly Nordic  
aliens and this began a lifelong contact  with great Ike ETS a really interesting case.</p>

<h6>Chapter 3: Paperboy</h6>
<p>Is about a gentleman who is now a college professor. As a young boy he was 
delivering papers when the UFO came right down on top of them he experienced missing  
time and some extraordinary after-effects as a result of his encounter I think it's a very  
important case 

<h6>Chapter 4: Jeannie</h6>
<p>Is about a lady named Jeannie and she found out that she was having  
contact with a 9-foot tall grasshopper type ET as well as gray type ETs it's an extraordinary  
case.</p>

<h6>Chapter 5: Writer/Professor</h6>
<p>It's about a gentleman a professor and writer who was driving along and had a UFO 
land right in front of him and out stepped this handsome looking Nordic alien it's a very 
interesting benevolent encounter with ETS.</p>

<h6>Chapter 6: Alien Outside My Window</h6>
<p>Involves an office worker &amp; new mother who had just had a baby boy and woke up to see a 
gray type ET looking through her window straight at her newborn son It was a terrifying 
encounter for her.</p>

<h6>Chapter 7: Harry</h6>
<p>Is about a gentleman named Harry who's  
had some extraordinary UFO sightings his entire life one of his very close-up encounters was with  
his wife they were driving along the road and they came upon a UFO hovering right alongside  
the road and there were two greys looking outside a large picture window right at them 
Harry has had some of the most extraordinary "Wow" sightings of anyone I've ever interviewed  
another one of my favorite chapters is 

<h6>Chapter 8: Jim</h6>
<p>This is about a gentleman named Jim who worked in the Navy as an electronics specialist. 
He had an extraordinary sighting with several shipmates. The sighing turned out to be much 
more than a sighting. He was contacted by ETs who taught him about alternative energy 
sources. It's one of my favorite cases in the book.

<h6>Chapter 9: Amazing Lady</h6>
<p>This is about an amazing lady; a housewife and mother from Nebraska who became very 
sick and suddenly had an encounter in which she was taken to what appears to be an 
underground base where she was healed of her illness by a nine foot tall ET with orange 
spiky hair. It's a totally unique case.</p>

<h6>Chapter 10 Kenneth</h6>
<p>The tenth and final chapter is about a man, a medical worker named Kenneth. He's 
had extraordinary encounters, missing time, and face-to-face encounters with gray type 
ETs. This is a fully conscious encounter in which the ETs explained exactly why they were
contacting him and he also experienced some very interesting after-effects.</p>

<p><That's it. That's my book "Inside UFOs". I didn't quite make it under three minutes but 
I tried. And now you have a good idea of what's inside "Inside UFOs" thanks for watching.</p>
